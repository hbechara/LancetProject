Conceived in 2003 and born in 2005 with the launch of its first report and country profiles, the Countdown to 2015 for
Maternal, Newborn, and Child Survival has reached its originally proposed lifespan. Major reductions in the deaths of
mothers and children have occurred since Countdown's inception, even though most of the 75 priority countries
failed to achieve Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5. The coverage of life-saving interventions tracked in
Countdown increased steadily over time, but wide inequalities persist between and within countries. Key drivers of
coverage such as financing, human resources, commodities, and conducive health policies also showed important,
yet insufficient increases. As a multistakeholder initiative of more than 40 academic, international, bilateral, and civil
society institutions, Countdown was successful in monitoring progress and raising the visibility of the health of
mothers, newborns, and children. Lessons learned from this initiative have direct bearing on monitoring progress
during the Sustainable Development Goals era.

10 years after the Countdown to 2015 for Maternal,
Newborn, and Child Survival (Countdown) was
launched, the world has become a healthier place for
children and women. The Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) sparked those involved in the 2003 Lancet
Child Survival Series to propose the Countdown
initiative, who pledged to hold regular conferences for
"ensuring that there is an overall mechanism for
improving accountability, re-energising commitment,
and recognising accomplishments in child survival".1
In response to this call to action, Countdown launched
its first report in 2005,2 which was followed by five others
(2008,3 2010,4 2012,5 2013,6 and 20147). The final report is
being released this week, on October 19, in Mexico City,
Mexico. From its original focus on child survival,
Countdown has expanded to track progress on
reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health
indicators relevant to MDGs 4 (reduce child mortality) and
5 (improve maternal health). The heart of the Countdown
reports are the two-page country profiles that summarise
the most recent data for intervention coverage, maternal
and child mortality, and nutrition. The country profiles
also highlight socioeconomic inequalities in intervention
coverage, and two of the main drivers of coverage: health
systems and policies, and financing.
Countdown has evolved in many ways during the past
decade. The partnership has grown from 11 to
43 institutional stakeholders, and the number of countries
monitored from 60 to 75, comprising more than 95% of
global deaths of mothers and children. As the scope
shifted beyond child survival, and in response to new
evidence, the number of indicators tracked expanded
from 35 to 73. By including new, proven interventions in
its profiles even before data were available for many
countries, Countdown has contributed to the identification
of data gaps and had arguably helped to raise the visibility
of such new interventions. Countdown recognised the
importance of engaging at country level, and from 2012
www.thelancet.com Vol 387 May 14, 2016

embarked on a set of case studies aimed at understanding
how countries have achieved progress (appendix pp 1-2).
Countdown is also the primary source of coverage
information for the Commission on Information and
Accountability for Women's and Children's Health and
the Independent Expert Review Group8 reports.
In the decade since Countdown's inception, the
number of reports on specific reproductive, maternal,
newborn, and child (RMNCH) health issues has grown
rapidly. Countdown's particular niche has been its
action-oriented focus on intervention coverage, and the
user-friendly synthesis of information in the country
profiles. Our principles have not changed over this
period:1 to focus on monitoring the coverage of evidencebased, cost-effective interventions; to maintain a country
orientation; and to build on existing goals and monitoring
efforts. Countdown's commitment to these principles
and its products have helped to increase the global
visibility of RMNCH, and has plausibly contributed to
reversing the slow rate of progress in reducing child,
newborn, and maternal mortality in the 1990s that was
documented in early public health series in The Lancet.1,9-11
As the MDG era draws to a close, the global public
health and development communities must take stock of
progress over the past 15 years, and get ready for the

Key messages
* Countdown to 2015 is a unique example of a multistakeholder initiative of academic,
international, bilateral, and civil society institutions focused on monitoring progress
in the health of the world's women and children
* Over a decade, regular reports from Countdown showed important progress by many
high-burden countries in increasing coverage with cost-effective, evidence-based
health interventions, and in preventing deaths of mothers and children
* Yet, substantial, reliable investments are required to achieve global targets and reduce
inequalities between and within countries
* Lessons learned from Countdown can inform global monitoring and accountability in
the era of Sustainable Development Goals

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) era. We assess
changes in the evidence and in data availability over this
period, and their implications for programme managers
and decision makers. We conclude by turning a crucial
lens on the SDG framework and future accountability
efforts, drawing on Countdown's monitoring experience.

The 2015 Countdown Results
Data
We have previously reported on Countdown's data
sources and methods,12,13 and these are described in detail
in the panel and the appendix (pp 3-4). In this section,
we summarise findings for 2015 with an emphasis on
time trends; the full results are available in the 2015
report.
Based on modelled estimates, the global maternal
mortality ratio has decreased by around 45% over the past
two decades, and the number of annual maternal deaths
has dropped from around 523 000 to 289 000.16 Although
mortality reductions seem to have accelerated--threequarters of Countdown countries reduced maternal
mortality faster in 2000-13 than in the 1990s13--very few
Countdown countries will achieve MDG 5. A 2009 analysis
of maternal deaths worldwide reported that more than
half of these were due to haemorrhage, hypertensive
disorders, and sepsis--causes that are preventable
through the provision of quality antenatal, delivery, and
postnatal care.17 Recognition of the role of contraception to
reduce maternal and newborn deaths has led to a major
Panel: Countdown data sources and methods
Most coverage, equity, and nutrition data come from
standardised population-based surveys (Demographic and
Health Surveys [DHS], Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys
[MICS], or other nationally representative surveys that meet
data quality standards). Mortality data are provided by United
Nation's sources.
Intervention coverage was monitored for the 75 Countdown
countries with data from 2009 to 2015. Coverage trends are
derived from countries that had at least two
datapoints, one from between 2000 and 2008, and the second
from 2009 to 2014. The composite coverage index (CCI) is a
weighted average of eight interventions along the continuum
of care, all of which have been available in most countries for
at least a decade.14,15 Results on socioeconomic inequalities are
based on wealth quintiles calculated on the basis of household
assets.15 Trends in CCI were estimated with 47 Countdown
countries with at least two surveys (either DHS or MICS) where
CCI was available, with survey years ranging from 1994 to
2014, using a multilevel model (appendix pp 3-4).
Health systems and policy indicators are derived from global
databases maintained by the WHO and other UN
organisations, and financing data are abstracted from
datasets maintained by the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development Assistance Committee.

increase in resources for family planning programmes.18
Evidence of the importance of reaching adolescents with
family planning and nutrition programmes for improving
birth outcomes, as well as their own health, has also
resulted in increased attention to this population group.19,20
The growing recognition of stillbirths as a public health
problem--2*6 million annual third trimester stillbirths,
with 1*2 million of these occurring in the intrapartum
period--led Countdown to report on the stillbirth rate
since 2010. Unfortunately, global visibility for stillbirths
might remain limited in the SDG era in view of the
absence of a specific target.21
The global under-5 mortality rate has dropped by 53%
since 1990, from 91 deaths per 1000 livebirths to 43 per
1000 livebirths in 2015.22 And, the global annual rate of
reduction has steeply accelerated over time, suggesting
that more progress can be expected in the coming years.
In 2000, the leading causes of the 10*8 million under-5
deaths were neonatal conditions (33%), diarrhoea (22%),
pneumonia (21%), malaria (9%), and AIDS (3%).23
Estimates for 2015 indicate 5*9 million deaths a year22
with a major shift in the causes of death: preterm birth
complications cause 18% of all under-5 deaths, and
along with other neonatal causes represent 45% of all
deaths. Deaths due to pneumonia (16%), diarrhoea (9%),
malaria (5%), and AIDS (1%) have declined in relative
terms, and even more so in absolute terms.24 The
growing concentration of deaths in the newborn period
and the improved understanding about causes of
newborn deaths has sparked the scale-up of long-existing
interventions and the development of new ones.
The past 10 years have also seen a growing understanding
of the role of nutrition in mortality and human
development.25,26 Suboptimal nutrition, including fetal
growth restriction, stunting, wasting, and deficiencies of
vitamin A and zinc along with suboptimum breastfeeding,
is an underlying cause of 45% of all deaths of children
younger than 5 years.25
Progress in the Countdown countries in reducing
maternal and under-5 mortality since 1990 is
summarised in table 1. A third of the 75 countries
achieved the annual rate of reduction of 4*4% or higher
in under-5 mortality that was needed to reach MDG 4 in
2015, but only six countries have achieved the annual
rate of reduction of 5*5% or higher in maternal
mortality required by MDG 5. The successful countries
are flagged in table 1. Four countries--Cambodia,
Eritrea, Nepal, and Rwanda--have achieved both MDGs
4 and 5.
Table 1 also shows another measure of progress, based
on whether each country has met the mortality thresholds
originally set for inclusion as a Countdown country. There
are two such thresholds. The first group of 60 countries
was selected in 2005 for monitoring by Countdown based
on their high levels of under-5 mortality--either an
under-5 mortality rate of 90 per 1000 livebirths or greater,
or an absolute annual number of deaths of 50 000 or more.

Of note, 2004 is the baseline year during which Countdown assessed countries for monitoring on the basis of U5MR (U5MR 90 or 50 000 deaths). In 2008, eight additional countries were included on the basis
of MMR using 2005 data (MMR >550 or MMR >200 and 750 maternal deaths). In 2012, six additional low-income countries were included to reconcile the Countdown and Global Strategy country lists: Comoros,
Kyrgyzstan, Sao Tome and Principe, and Solomon Islands. The 2005 report includes the U5MR but not the absolute number of deaths. U5MR=under-5 mortality rate per 1000 livebirths. MMR=maternal mortality
rate per 100 000 livebirths. *Average annual rate of reduction of at least 4*4% for U5MR between 1990 and 2015. Average annual rate of reduction of 5*5% or higher for MMR between 1990 and 2013.

Table 1: Countdown countries and so-called graduation status based on original entry criteria

Among these 60 countries, 28 have now graduated from
Countdown by reducing child mortality below this
threshold. In 2008, Countdown broadened its scope, by
including eight additional countries with maternal
mortality ratios of more than 550 per 100 000 livebirths, or
a ratio of more than 200 plus an absolute annual number
of maternal deaths of more than 750. Of the eight, seven
have now graduated by reducing maternal mortality below
this threshold. The remaining seven priority countries
were added after 2008, to maintain consistency with the
priority low-income countries listed in the Global Strategy
for Women's and Children's Health, and to include South
Sudan after it was formed in 2012.
2052

Alternative estimates for maternal27 and child28
mortality are available from the Institute of Health
Metrics and Evaluation. Although their estimates of
levels and trends for specific countries might differ from
those presented in table 1, the overall conclusions are the
same: a small minority of low-income and middle-income
countries will reach either MDG 4 or 5.
In the next four sections, we summarise recent results
from Countdown's four streams of technical work:
coverage, equity, health systems and policies, and
financing. We also highlight progress in data availability
and some of the most important data gaps that remain in
each of these areas.

Coverage
Figure 1 shows coverage across the continuum of care for
selected high-impact interventions, and the service
contacts through which these and other interventions can
be delivered. The bars show the median coverage reported
by all Countdown countries with data available in 2009 or
later; the grey dots show the values for individual
countries. Coverage levels are particularly low around the
time of birth, and for case-management interventions for
childhood illnesses. The list of coverage indicators tracked
in Countdown has evolved with time. For example,
indicators for rotavirus vaccine and pneumococcal
conjugate vaccine were added in 2014 because of increased
data availability following rapid policy adoption by
countries. We no longer track the indicator of antibiotic
treatment for childhood pneumonia, because validation
studies have shown that this cannot be measured
accurately in household surveys.29 We have retained the
indicator on oral rehydration therapy (oral rehydration
salts), increased fluids, and continued feeding) to allow
the examination of trends. However, WHO/UNICEF
guidelines now recommend oral rehydration salts and
zinc, and in the future it will be important to track
coverage for both. In 2015, 37 countries had coverage data
www.thelancet.com Vol 387 May 14, 2016

for zinc treatment of diarrhoea. The median coverage was
1%, with a high of 28% in Malawi. Results for the full set
of Countdown coverage indicators are available in the
appendix (pp 5-7) and appendix (pp 8-11) provides
information about HIV and caesarean-section indicators.
Data availability (figure 1) has improved for all indicators
measured through household surveys. For example, the
number of countries with information about postnatal care
visits for babies increased from five during the period
2000-063 to 35 in 2009-14. The rapid expansion of
household surveys in the wake of the MDGs led to real
progress in ensuring that all countries have recent,
high-quality data to guide their programmes and policies.30,31
Our results continue to show unacceptably low
coverage for most of these interventions and service
contacts, with enormous ranges among countries
around the global median values. Even interventions for
the prevention of malaria, which have shown greater
accelerations in coverage than any other indicators in
recent years,32 are not reaching their life-saving potential.
In endemic countries with available data, only 23% of
women report receipt of malaria prevention during
pregnancy, and only 38% of children younger than
5 years were reported to be sleeping under an

the two periods

insecticide-treated net. Treatment interventions are still
reaching fewer than 40% of children with malaria or
diarrhoea, and only 54% of children with symptoms of
pneumonia are taken outside the home for care.
Immunisations continue to be an exception, with
median coverage generally greater than 85%, although
intercountry variation is still marked.
Time trends in intervention coverage were featured in
an earlier publication32 and are updated in table 2.
Three broad patterns are evident. First, the three malaria
interventions that started less than 20% in the earlier
period showed substantial increases with time. HIV
interventions are not shown in table 2 because baseline
data were not available due to changes in the methods,
but the prevention of mother-to-child transmissions with
antiretrovirals reached 53% in the most recent period
with a range of 1% to more than 95% across countries
with data. Second, some interventions already showed
high coverage around 2000, and increased modestly in
2054

absolute terms, partly because there was little scope for
increase; these include antenatal care (at least one visit),
improved drinking water sources, and the three vaccines.
Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of the gap was
closed for these interventions. The third group includes
all other interventions, which had less than 60% coverage
up to 2009 and increased by 10% points or less: family
planning, four or more antenatal care visits, skilled birth
attendance, improved sanitation facilities, exclusive
breastfeeding, and all the case-management interventions
against diarrhoea and pneumonia. These patterns
suggest that rapid coverage increases are possible when
interventions are prioritised and generously funded as in
the case of the malaria or HIV indicators. On the other
hand, very little progress was noted for interventions that
require service contacts along the continuum of care and
24/7 service availability, particularly during pregnancy
and childbirth, and for the management of childhood
diarrhoea and pneumonia.
Further improvement is needed urgently in the quantity
and quality of data for monitoring coverage. For example,
there is no guarantee that women and children who report
a service contact actually receive the full complement of
interventions that should be delivered during that contact.
Reported coverage for antenatal, delivery, and postnatal
care therefore represent so-called best case scenarios for
actual coverage of interventions that should be provided
during those contacts. New Countdown secondary
analyses of patterns of antenatal care in seven countries
show widely varying patterns of drop-off between the first
antenatal care visit and subsequent visits, with women
reporting more visits having an increased probability of
receiving recommended interventions. Redoubled efforts
are needed to ensure that contact with health services
results in the delivery of all recommended life-saving
interventions. New approaches are also needed to link
household surveys and health facility survey data to
generate essential data for service quality that are currently
lacking (appendix pp 12-13).

Equity
The equity dimension was noticeably absent from the
MDGs.33 Since its first report, Countdown has provided
original analyses of inequalities in intervention coverage
by wealth, sex of the child, place of residence, and other
social determinants. These analyses consistently show
systematic pro-rich inequalities for virtually all coverage
indicators.34 The gaps are wider for interventions, such
as antenatal care (four or more visits) and skilled birth
attendance, that require access to fixed health facilities,
compared with interventions such as immunisation
that can be delivered at community level.34 Our analyses
have also shown that countries that made rapid progress
in coverage were those that effectively reached the
poorest families.35
The growing availability of surveys allows disaggregated
analyses of trends in coverage for the poorest and richest

Review

Health systems and policies
Supportive policy environments and functional health
systems with adequate human resources are prerequisites
for high and equitable coverage. The number of policy
and systems indicators tracked in Countdown has
increased from five in 2005 to 11 in this year's 2015 report,
including four measures of systems that are crucial to
effective service delivery for women and children. These
indicators are consistent with international frameworks.36,37
Although further work is needed to develop comparable
metrics for implementation strength at national and
subnational levels, Countdown is finalising a set of
instruments to describe relevant policies and aspects of
RMNCH programme implementation across countries
and over time.
Notable progress in adoption of supportive policies has
occurred across the Countdown countries (appendix p 14
shows adoption rates for ten essential policies based on a
2013-14 WHO survey). Figure 3 shows that the number
of countries that adopted each of six policies for which
trend data are available increased substantially between
2008 and 2014. However, more progress is needed,
particularly for policies that are lagging such as maternity
protection in accordance with Convention 183 of the
International Labour Organisation (including maternity
leave and employment protection during pregnancy and
the postnatal period) and the International Code of
Marketing for Breastmilk Substitutes.
Increased investment in information systems has
resulted in an expansion of available data for skilled
health professionals.38 Three-quarters of Countdown
countries remain below 22*8 physicians, nurses, and
midwives per 10 000 population, a threshold WHO
considers necessary to achieve relatively high coverage

quintiles of mothers and children, across a large number
of countries. Figure 2 shows these results for the
composite coverage index (CCI) in 47 Countdown
countries with available information from several
surveys. Globally, CCI coverage increased for both the
richest and poorest quintiles, but the increase was
steeper among the poorest (1*0% point per year
[95% CI 0*8-1*1]) than for the richest (0*3% point
[0*2-0*4]; figure 2A). The rich-poor gap declined from
28% points in 2000 to 19% points by 2014. This finding
indicates an increase in coverage equity in both absolute
and relative terms (both trends with p<0*0001; figure 2B).
Whereas the coverage gap between rich and poor
mothers and children persists, inequalities are decreasing,
at least for the eight long standing interventions that are
part of the CCI.
Similar to coverage, data availability for equity analyses
has improved, but there is still much scope for progress.
Repeated surveys with consistent measurement of equity
stratifiers, such as wealth, sex, residence, or ethnic
origin, are required to identify priority groups and track
subnational progress over time.

of essential health interventions.38 The most recent
estimates show a median density of skilled health
professionals of 10*2 per 10 000 population in the
Countdown countries, ranging from 1*6 per 10 000 in
Madagascar and Niger to 142 per 10 000 population
in Uzbekistan.
Countdown has contributed to substantial increases in
data availability on policies by helping to shape the
contents of the WHO's biannual policy survey. More
work is needed to overcome the limitations of the use of
a survey-based approach, to ensure more timely and
accurate information, and to explore associations
between policies and changes in coverage levels. Efforts
are under way to assess the feasibility of collection of data
for selected tracer indicators of the quality of care
(appendix pp 12-13).

Financing
The establishment of the MDG framework led to a

and children's health,39 and official development

assistance (ODA) surged after the MDG summit in
2000.40 Although the growth in ODA slowed after the
economic crisis in 2007-08, trends from 2003 to 2012 in
Countdown countries show a tripling of ODA to
maternal, newborn, and child health (from US$2 billion
to $6 billion). Most of the investment was for general
health care (including health systems support),
reproductive health, malaria programmes, and
immunisation programmes.40 During this same time
period, ODA for projects that mention newborns grew
exponentially, from $33 million to $1 billion, reflecting
the growing visibility of newborn health, yet far too little
in view that neonatal causes represent almost half of
under-5 deaths. A comparison of the present estimates
with those produced by the Institute of Health Metrics
and Evaluation, the Partnership for Maternal Newborn
and Child Health, and United Nations Population Fund
is available in the full Countdown report. Although
these funding increases and the spike in high level
commitments to RMNCH between 2010 and 2015 are
encouraging, more is needed. In particular, better
targeting of resources to countries with the greatest
need could help to narrow equity gaps and help to
achieve the next set of goals.
Each of the Countdown case studies include a detailed
analysis of trends in financial flows to RMNCH, and
show the complexity of the funding environment. The
Peru and Ethiopia case studies, for example, both showed
rapid recent growth in RMNCH expenditures. Yet the
two countries used different resources and financing
mechanisms to fund their programmes. Peru, an
upper-middle-income country, relied mostly on domestic
funding, whereas Ethiopia, a low-income country, relied
heavily on external funding. Both countries have high
levels of out-of-pocket spending, which must be
addressed to make health care more affordable to
disadvantaged population groups.
What about the future? The general consensus across
the panoply of resource tracking efforts is that ODA
expenditures for RMNCH are increasing.40,41 For domestic
spending there is insufficient data for RMNCH
expenditure to estimate trends. The work of the Lancet
Global Commission on Investing in Health, which
emphasises the centrality of RMNCH to achieve global
development, and the World Bank's recently announced
Global Financing Facility for RMNCH, are signs that
investments in RMNCH will continue to grow.42,43
However, the multiplicity of goals and targets in the SDG
framework could detract from a sustained and accelerated
focus on RMNCH, leaving many donor-dependent
countries short of funds. The most important future
strategies could be those that shore-up the contribution
of national sources to RMNCH, using mechanisms
such as the establishment of concrete accountability
procedures that strengthen the collaboration between
citizens and governments and build more sustainable
and efficient funding for RMNCH at local levels.
2056

Monitoring and accountability: how can the
Countdown experience inform the SDGs?
The MDGs encouraged global political consensus,
provided a focus for advocacy and visibility, improved the
targeting and flow of aid, and strengthened monitoring of
process and outcome indicators.39 Within the context of
the health MDGs, Countdown played a unique part as a
multistakeholder initiative. Countdown's success in
monitoring and accountability at country level for MDGs
4 and 544,45 was complemented by other initiatives, such as
the Independent Expert Review Group,8 that relied heavily
on our data to push for global level accountability. Our
experience has inspired others. For example, advocates
for the Non-Communicable Diseases Countdown 2025
wrote: "lessons from Countdown to 2015 include the
importance of collaboration and inclusiveness; adaptation
of global targets to the national situation; regular
measurement; transparent review and publication of
progress on priority interventions and outcomes; strong
engagement of academia and civil society; regular reports
based on fairly simple summaries of country progress;
and adequate resources. Countdown to 2015, while
retaining a core of basic information, has evolved to
include detailed country reports and shows the value of a
strong and independent partnership for global health."46
Leaders of global initiatives developed to track physical
activity (P C Hallal, personal communication) and
nutrition (L Haddad, personal communication) also
acknowledge that Countdown has inspired their work.
This final Countdown report focuses on time trends in
the past 15 years. Intervention coverage increased for
most interventions, and particularly for those that
received substantial donor investment such as interventions against malaria and HIV.7,13 The gap in coverage
between rich and poor seems to be narrowing, at least for
interventions that have been available in low-income
countries for many years. More countries are adopting
RMNCH policies, and financing for the health of
mothers, newborns, and children has increased. Each of
these statements about general trends, however, must be
qualified. Cost-effective interventions are still failing to
reach a large proportion of those who need them.
Socioeconomic inequities in coverage are still rampant
within virtually every Countdown country. Essential
policies and sufficient and equitably distributed human
resources and commodities are still lacking in most
countries. And despite increased funding, there is still a
huge shortfall of reliable resources for RMNCH.
The post-2015 SDGs are unquestionably much broader
and more complex than the MDGs. Their adoption will
bring about substantive challenges to monitoring and
accountability. To conclude, we address how lessons
learned from the Countdown process could be relevant to
the SDG era.
The MDGs were launched in 2000 with a baseline of
1990, a peculiar choice implying that signatory countries
were held accountable for trends during the preceding

10 years. Additionally, the absence of real-time data for
births and deaths led to complex modelling procedures to
estimate concurrent and past maternal and child
mortality. Reliance on these methods meant that historical
trends were revised every time new data became available.
Baseline values therefore kept changing, and countries
seemed to be aiming at moving targets. Fortunately, the
SDG starting date is fixed in 2015, but substantial
investments in data collection are urgently needed to
provide valid and precise baseline levels.
Whereas child mortality estimates are based on actual
data from censuses, surveys, or civil registration, maternal
mortality is modelled for most low-income and middleincome countries on the basis of predictor variables such
as gross domestic product per capita, fertility, HIV
prevalence, and coverage of skilled birth attendants.16
There are important problems with the acceptability of
modelled estimates at country level, yet very few countries
have invested in large-scale surveys or registration
systems to actually measure maternal mortality.47,48
In summary, monitoring during the MDG era was
largely dependent on modelled mortality estimates,
coverage measurements derived from infrequent
household surveys, and ad-hoc systems for tracking
policies, health system measures, and funding flows.
Additionally, the MDG framework has been largely
criticised for its neglect of equity. If the international
community is serious about achieving the SDGs, it must
invest now in improvements and innovations in
measurement.49 The area of measurement of effective
coverage and the quality of preventive and curative
interventions deserves special attention.
There are other aspects of the SDGs that the Countdown
experience suggests are likely to be problematic. For
example, MDGs 4 and 5 were clearly defined, with
quantitative goals for relative mortality reductions. The
corresponding SDGs (3*1 and 3*2) propose absolute
targets of 25 per 1000 livebirths at national level for
under-5 mortality, 12 per 1000 livebirths for neonatal
mortality, and a global maternal mortality ratio of 70 per
100 000 livebirths. According to 2013 estimates,
six Countdown countries already have under-5 mortality
rates less than 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths, and 11 have
maternal mortality rates less than 70 deaths per
100 000 livebirths (table 1). What type of progress, if any,
should these countries be aiming at? Based on the
Countdown experience of interacting with countries
regarding progress towards global goals, we believe that
the provisional SDG targets must be urgently revisited.
It is also important for targets to be realistic. The fact
that only 25 and six of the 75 Countdown countries will
likely reach MDGs 4 and 5, respectively, suggests that the
original targets were too ambitious in view of the reported
progress in terms of financial flows and health systems
factors such as human resources and policies.
The Countdown experience taught us the importance
of identifying evidence-based interventions, and tracking
www.thelancet.com Vol 387 May 14, 2016

coverage change over time on a country-by-country basis.
Although monitoring of 73 coverage indicators is a huge
task, it provides specific feedback on what needs to be
improved, and where. This level of detail is essential, but
we also felt a need for a summary measure--the CCI. We
found this to be robust, stable, and highly associated with
measures of mortality.7 The CCI provides a promising
approach to the measurement of universal health
coverage, and includes a focus on equity, two pillars that
lie at the heart of the health SDG.
The large number of SDG targets--169 at some stage--
has brought about substantial criticism.50,51 Although
work is under way to trim down this list, the Countdown
experience shows that an initially small list of goals and
core indicators can rapidly expand with time, as new
interventions become available, and as different interest
groups lobby--often with strong justification--for
inclusion of additional indicators. A rigorous technical
process must be in place to ensure the validity and
reliability of these new indicators, to make sure
monitoring efforts stay coordinated and focused, and to
minimise the reporting burden on countries.
Countdown found its niche in a plethora of global
initiatives: a focus on intervention coverage at country
level. Our focus does not overlook other drivers of
women's and children's health, such as social or
environmental determinants.52 We recognise that
biomedical interventions are one of the most important
pathways through which distal, social determinants affect
health. During the SDG era, tracking progress in social
and environmental determinants and understanding how
these affect health and development will be just as
important as tracking progress in coverage or health
status, and will likely face similar data availability
challenges as were faced by Countdown.
Other aspects of the Countdown experience might be
relevant to similar initiatives in the SDG era. Involvement
of many stakeholders is essential to ensure that data lead
to action. Retaining scientific independence in the midst
of stakeholders with different interests and agendas was
not always a smooth process, but Countdown managed to
achieve and maintain consensus on indicators that
should be monitored and disseminated. Positive pressure
from stakeholders led to our expansion from child
survival in 2003 to the full RMNCH continuum of care.
Balancing focus with breadth is not easy, and will likely be
even harder in the SDG era, both within the health goal
and across all 17 SDGs.53 Countdown engaged with civil
society at the international level, as several of its
stakeholders represent such constituencies. Engagement
at national level, however, was mostly restricted to
countries where case studies were done and disseminated.
Nevertheless, several of the key Countdown stakeholders
led activities at national level that were consistent with
our mandate and harmonised with our main messages.
A Viewpoint54 in this issue of The Lancet explores future
directions for Countdown. Regardless of what lies ahead,

our experience in the past 10 years has established the
importance and feasibility of a multistakeholder
initiative, with independence and a strong technical
component, in accelerating progress for the world's
mothers and children. The auspicious launch of a Global
Financing Facility42 in support of the Every Woman Every
Child initiative highlights the need for continued,
independent monitoring and accountability in the future.
