1.1: Health and heat
1.1.1: Vulnerability to extremes of heat
The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the 2018
Lancet Countdown report appendix.1 This indicator displays an index derived by
taking mean of proportion of the population over 65 years;2 the prevalence of
cardiovascular, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases among population over
65 years using GBD study 2017 estimates;3 and the proportion of the population
living in urban areas as a measure of exposure to urban heat island.4 The index
ranges between 0 and 100 and is a measure of potential vulnerability to heat
exposure of the population over 65 years by country. Aggregated trends are
displayed by WHO regional classifications for the period 1990 to 2017.

Future
Form of
Indicator

There is no consistent and universally accepted standard for distinguishing urban
from rural areas, in part because of the wide variety of situations across countries.
Most countries use an urban classification related to the size or characteristics of
settlements.4 This indicator does not include the existence of heat early warning
systems, or prevalence of cooling devices. Neither does it include the prevalence of
green areas in cities.
GBD and urbanisation estimates now are revised annually; the indicator will be
updated every year.

1.1: Health and heat
1.1.2: Health and exposure to warming
The methodology for this indicator remains similar to that described in the 2018
Lancet Countdown report appendix,1 with improved resolution for the 2019
report. Change in summer temperature was calculated on a global grid (0.5
spacing). A baseline temperature grid was calculated as the average of summer
temperatures (June, July, August for the northern hemisphere, December, January,
February for the southern hemisphere) from 1986-2005 using a global grid of
temperatures from the ERA-Interim numerical weather reanalysis dataset. Using
this same dataset, temperature changes relative to the 1986-2005 average were
calculated for every grid point for every year. The `area weighted' average of the
grid was calculated by weighting each grid cell by the relative area of that grid cell
on the earth's surface, to take into account the mapping from the 2D rectangular
grid to the spherical earth's surface. The `population weighted' average was
calculating by weighting each grid cell by the fraction of the total world population
contained within that grid cell.

1.1.3: Health and exposure of vulnerable populations to heatwaves
The methodology for this indicator remains similar to that described in the 2018
Lancet Countdown report appendix,1 with improved resolution for the 2019 report.
A heatwave was defined as a period more than 3 days at a given location where the
minimum daily temperature was greater than the 99th percentile of the distribution
of minimum daily temperature at that location over the 1986-2005 reference
period for the summer months. Calculations were performed on a 0.5 global grid
using ERA-Interim data.
The gridded 99th percentile of daily minimum temperature was calculated for 19862005. For each year from 1986 to present, the number of heatwave events and
total days of heatwaves per year was calculated according to the definition above.
For each year from 2000 to present, the change in number of occurrences and
number of days of heatwaves was calculated.
The vulnerable population was defined as people over the age of 65. Gridded
population and demographic data from GPWv4 was used. The change in exposures
in person-events was calculated for each year by multiplying the change in number
of heatwave events by the number of vulnerable people per grid cell.

1.1: Health and heat
1.1.4: Change in labour capacity
Global gridded (0.5) three hourly temperature, dew point temperature and surface
solar radiation downwards was used to calculate wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT)
WBGT indoors (or outdoors in the shade) and WBGT outdoors in the sun. The WBGT
calculator used was downloaded from www.climatechip.org. A productivity loss function
derived from experimental data was used to quantify the productivity loss with
increasing WBGT.
The function relating the fraction of total work hours lost to Wet Bulb Globe
Temperature (WBGT) is given by the cumulative normal distribution function:
1
WBGT - Prodmean
  = (1 + ERF (
))
2
ProdSD  2
Where WBGT is WBGTmax, WBGTmean or WBGThalf and the parameters for a given
activity level (defined as the amount of internal heat generated in performing the
activity) are given in Table 1. Labour is divided into three sectors: service (activity level of
200W), industry (300W), and agriculture (400W). The loss curves for 200W, 300W, and
400W are shown in Figure 1.

This fraction of work hours lost are clipped at both extremes. People take micro-breaks
during normal work so when the function predicts 10% or less work hours lost it is
assumed zero work hours are lost. It is further assumed that people always have some
capacity for work, no matter what the conditions so it is assumed that a 90% of work
hours lost is a maximum. The corresponding adjusted loss fraction is therefore given by:
0,    < 0.1
   = { ,  0.1     0.9
0.9,    > 0.9

The number of people in each grid cell working in each sector was then estimated from
the working population of that grid cell and the approximate percentage of people
working in each sector. This is then multiplied by the potential work hours lost per

person to obtain the total population weighted hours lost in that grid cell. The total work
hours lost (WHL) are then summed for global totals or country totals. To obtain the
"equivalent full-time workers lost", potential WHL are divided by 4380 - the potential
maximum daylight hours that can be worked per year.

Caveats

Sector employment from ILO.7
The distribution of agricultural, manufacturing and service sector workers is only
reported at country level, hence this proportion is distributed evenly to all grid cells. In
the future this indicator will have finer detail on the sector employment.
Potential full-time work lost assumes 12 hours a day, 365 days a year. Future versions of
this indicator shall work to estimate potential full-time equivalent work lost, by linking
potential WHL with average annual hours worked by country and sector.
This indicator will be updated in future to show the number of workers affected globally
and in larger countries (eg China and India).

1.2: Health and extreme weather events
1.2.1: Wildfires
Fire point locations were matched to a political border shapefile from the Global Burden of
Disease (version 2017)8 with 195 defined nations. Population count per squared-kilometre
was matched to the GBD global shapefile using the NASA GPWv4 dataset. For each country,
the daily number of fire points were multiplied by the total population count within the
corresponding grid point to estimate the number of persons exposed to a fire event in a
day. The number of persons exposed to a fire event in a day per country were averaged for
years 2001-2004 and 2015-2018 to give a change in person days exposed to fire.

Population data from the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)
Gridded Population of the World (GPWv4).6
The satellite data does not account for cloud cover or smoke and data is not collected at
night. While observing the same fire, Terra and Aqua may report slightly different
coordinates of the fire centroid, therefore introducing a double counting issue. Fire
characteristics change every year, and a year to year comparison is not appropriate. The
average of the first four years of available MODIS data acts as an initial starting point to
compare later years to reflect change. However, the GPW population count was not
interpolated and may results in higher uncertainties in estimation of persons exposed.
This indicator will be extended to longer term averages.
Subnational estimates will be reported to better represent the populations at risk.

1.2.2: Flood and drought
The methodology for this indicator remains similar to that described in the 2018
Lancet Countdown report appendix,1 with improved resolution for the 2019 report.
Drought
The drought indicator was based on the WMO-recommended Standard
Precipitation Index (SPI),10 based on the 6-month rolling sum of monthly
precipitation. The index was calibrated using gridded monthly precipitation data
covering the period from 1900-2005 from the CRU monthly precipitation dataset. A
given month was defined as being in drought when the SPI for that month is less
than -1.5. Yearly totals of months in drought were calculated on a 0.5 global grid.
Exposure to drought was calculated using the GPWv4 gridded population dataset.
The drought indicator is defined as gridded sum of months in drought times the
gridded population and is given in units of person-months in drought.
Extreme rainfall
Extreme rainfall events are defined as starting when the 5-day rolling sum of daily
precipitation exceeding the 10-year return level and ending when it dropped below
this value. The rolling sum of precipitation was calculated for each day as the sum
of the preceding 5 days total precipitation (in mm).
The precipitation value corresponding to the 10-year return period was calculated
using the method described the corresponding Lancet Climate Countdown 2018
appendix.1 The baseline precipitation threshold was calculated by applying this
method to daily total precipitation derived from ERA-Interim for the period 19862005. The number of extreme rainfall events per year in the period 2000 to present
8

was calculated by counting the number of periods for each grid cell where the
precipitation exceeded the baseline precipitation threshold, using the daily total
precipitation derived from ERA-Interim.
The number of exposure events was calculated by multiplying the number of
extreme rainfall events by the number of people in each grid cell, given in units of
person-events. Population data was derived from the NASA GWPv4.

1.2: Health and extreme weather events
1.2.3: Lethality of weather-related disasters
The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the 2018
report of the Lancet Countdown.1 This indicator is based on the generic
formulation from a climate change perspective of disasters as a function of
hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Year to year variation was measured, showing
the number of people killed as a proportion of those affected by different hazard
type, normalised by the strength of the individual hazards as a measure of
adaptive (or maladaptive) changes in national health care services and the
associated disaster preparedness and response.
Here, deaths are defined as the number of people who lost their life because the
disaster happened, and people affected as those requiring immediate assistance
during a period of emergency; hence requiring basic survival needs such as food,
water, shelter, sanitation and immediate medical assistance.
The data has been presented as standardised anomalies, representing the
difference between the variable that year and average of the variable from 19902009, normalised by the standard deviation of the variable over the same period.

Data
Caveats

Only statistically significant (at 0.05 significance level) linear trends over time are
shown.

One underlying assumption is that the normalised number of people killed by
climate related disasters is an accurate proxy for measuring health impacts of the
climate.
This measure ignores the longer causal chains involving the interaction of climate
and health.

Future Form
of Indicator

Finally, a further limitation is that this measure ignores the longer causal chains
involving the interactions of weather, climate, disasters, health and health
services
Future efforts will include a comparison of estimates of those exposed with those
affected. Additionally, the impact of replacing the number of people killed with
the number requiring assistance also explored.
A subsidiary indicator will come from the online Sendai Framework Monitor. Here
countries will start reporting against the Sendai Framework indicators and the
DRR related indicators of the SDGs. The first Sendai Framework and SDG progress
report will be released in 2019. This indicator therefore aims to expand to include
country specific progress in vulnerability levels of health service systems to
climate risks in relation to this monitoring data.

1.3: Global health trends in climate-sensitive diseases
The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the 2018
Lancet Countdown report appendix.1 This indicator displays generally unprocessed
descriptive trends for selected diseases retrieved from The Global Burden of
Disease (GBD) project database over the period 1990-2017.8 The derivation of
estimates within the GBD study relies on modelling, rather than analysing direct
observations, and the GBD methodology has already been described.13 The trends
are aggregated and presented by WHO region as mortality rates per 100,000
individuals per year over the period. As far as can be ascertained from the GBD
documentation, climate change and weather are not part of the covariates
included in the estimates, making it valid to examine GBD outputs in the light of
climate and weather data to formulate coherent inter-country comparisons.
Trends are described for: all causes of death, malaria, dengue, diarrhoeal diseases,
protein-energy malnutrition, heat and cold exposure, and forces of nature.
Deaths directly related to forces of nature have been adjusted for the effects of
the most severe seismic events and related tsunamis. Years with events reported
to have caused a substantial death toll from 1990 to 2016 where discounted by
replacing with the same countries' force of nature mortality for the previous year.

This is not a direct measure of the impact of climate change on death and disease.
Rather, it presents mortality figures for those diseases which are none to be
influenced by climate. The trends presented therefore do not show detection and
attribution of climate change to death. They do show the impact of climate
relevant and climate sensitive diseases on mortality rates globally since 1990.
GBD estimates are now revised annually. Future versions of this indicator may
include additional health conditions, may include morbidity as well as mortality,
and may extend to national and subnational scales. Increased interest in geospatial disease analyses is likely to lead to additional information, such as fringe
zone trends and outbreaks, and associate patterns of diseases to climate
anomalies, such as those driven by the ENSO circulation. Future disease trends in
the GBD estimates will be linked to direct measurements in resource poor areas in
Africa and Asia, for example using longitudinal mortality registers from the
INDEPTH network.13

1.4: Climate-sensitive infectious diseases
1.4.1 Climate-sensitive infectious diseases - dengue
Context:
Cases of dengue have doubled every decade since 1990, with 584 million (236
million-1219 million) apparent cases in 2013, accounting for over 10,000 deaths and
114 million (073 million-198 million) disability-adjusted life-years.14 Beside global
mobility, climate change has been suggested as one potential contributor to this
increase in burden.15 Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus, the principal vectors of dengue,
also carry other important emerging or re-emerging arboviruses, including Yellow
Fever, Chikungunya, Mayaro, and Zika viruses, and are likely to be similarly responsive
to climate change.
Methods:
Methods for calculating vectorial capacity (VC) follow Rocklov et al. (2019).16 VC refers
to a vector's ability to transmit disease to humans. It incorporates interactions
between host, virus, and vector, assuming that all three of these elements are present.
Specifically, VC represents the average daily number of secondary cases generated by
one primary case introduced into a fully susceptible population, and is expressed as:
 = 2   /-
where a is the average vector biting rate,  is the probability of vector infection and
transmission of virus to its saliva, p is the daily survival probability, n is the duration of
the extrinsic incubation period - EIP, and m is the female vector-to-human population
ratio. Here m is set to 1 assuming female vector and human population are constant.
Detailed model description and explanation can be found in Rocklov et al. (2019).16 In
this application, the time unit is 1 day and each of the vector parameters depends on
temperature, with parameter values derived from the literature, typically from
experimental data, as described in Liu-Helmersson et al., (2014).17 Diurnal temperature
range (DTR) was reconstructed using a representative daily temperature through a
14

piece-wise sinusoidal function based on the monthly average of daily minimum,
maximum, and mean observations.
Historical trends were derived by backcasting the models on data from the Climate
Research Unit (CRU) online database, time series (CRU-TS 3.22) of gridded (0.5)
monthly averages of daily temperature observations (minimums, maximum, and
mean) for the time period 1950-2017.
Future projections were derived using climate data under two greenhouse gas
emission pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5),18 representing the contrast between very
strong mitigation action vs. business-as-usual given consequent radiative forcing of
greenhouse gases in the year 2100 (+2.6 and +8.5 W m-2, respectively), based on
CMIP5 atmosphere-ocean general circulation models.19,20 For each emission pathway,
CMIP5 temperature datasets (min, max, mean resolution 0.5 x 0.5) were used.
Calculations from each of the five global models (NorESM1-M, MIROC-ESM-CHEM,
IPSL-CM5A-LR, HadGEM2-ES, and GFDL-ESM2M) were averaged to derive a multimodel ensemble.
The annual average VC were extracted values per grid cell to Aedes aegypti and Aedes
albopictus presence locations provided in Kraemer et al. (2015)21 and averaged these
values by country to get country-specific trends in VC at monthly (seasonality analysis)
or yearly time steps from 1950-2017 for each species. `Global vectorial capacity'
indicates globally averaged values across all countries.
Historical percentage change figures reported in the main text were calculated relative
to a 1950s baseline (5 year average, 1950-54), either an average for the 2010s (5 year
average, 2013-2017) to illustrate the overall trend accounting for interannual
variability or for the most recent year for which data were available (2017). Projected
percentage changes in VC for each vector in 2030 (taken from 5yr average 2028-2032)
was calculated relative to a present baseline (5 yr average 2013-2017).

Future Form of
Indicator

Key caveats and limitations of the VC model and its parameterisation are fully
described in Liu-Helmersson et al. (2014, 2016)17,22 and Rocklov et al., (2019).16 VC
should not be confused with actual dengue cases, although it is an indicator of the risk
of infection.
The disease indicators will be reported upon annually and assessed against the
baseline data and trends presented here. Other climate-sensitive infectious diseases in
addition to malaria, Vibrio, and dengue will be added through time and the current
indicators refined. In future, it is intended to expand efforts to project trends (as for
dengue) using available models (e.g., RCPs from AR5). In addition, efforts will expand
to link environmental suitability information to disease outcomes e.g., via disease case
or surveillance data. Numerous jurisdictions currently already undertake indicator
(e.g., annual country- or regional-level reporting of confirmed human cases), eventbased (e.g., outbreak investigation and `epidemic intelligence'), and biosecurity (e.g.,
16

sentinel site) surveillance for infectious diseases, vectors, or key zoonotic hosts. Many
of these datasets and methods of analysis could be made available and leveraged in
future for the Lancet Countdown. For example, EU member states already report cases
of notifiable diseases, zoonotic diseases, and outbreaks of food-borne and zoonotic
disease, while vector surveillance remains voluntary.23

1.4.1 Climate-sensitive infectious diseases - malaria
Context
Temperature, precipitation and relative humidity are climatic factors that impact the
abundance and feeding cycle rate of Anopheles mosquitoes, which transmit the
Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. Temperature also drives the development rate of
Plasmodium parasites within the mosquito vectors24Temperatures within the range 18C to
32C are considered most suitable for P. falciparum, while a lower temperature limit of 15C
has been reported for P. vivax.25 Below these lower limits the development of the parasite
ceases while above 32C the survival of the mosquito is compromised. Relative humidity
greater than 60% is also considered as a requirement for the mosquito to survive long
enough for the parasite to develop sufficiently to be transmitted to the human host stage.
Rainfall and surface water are needed for the egg laying and larval stages of the mosquito
life cycle, with monthly rainfall accumulation of at least 80mm considered more suitable for
transmission.24
A recent study found a significant increase in elevation of the lower temperature limits for
the development of malaria parasites in Ethiopia.26 Increasing temperatures in the region
are eroding the perceived barrier to malaria transmission, allowing more favourable
conditions to begin climbing into densely populated highland areas. Highland areas are the
most densely populated agro-climatic zone in sub-Saharan Africa, occupying just 4.4% of
the land area but 19.4% (44 million) of the population.
The malaria indicator focuses on determining global changes in climate suitability over time
between highland and lowland areas in regions that have not yet achieved elimination.
Methods
The number of months suitable for malaria transmission per year from 1950 - 2017 was
calculated globally. Suitability is based on empirically-derived thresholds of precipitation,
temperature and relative humidity for two primary parasites causing malaria (Plasmodium
falciparum, P. vivax).
Monthly observations of temperature, precipitation and vapour pressure data from the
Climate Research Unit (CRU TS4.01)11 were downloaded using the KNMI Climate Explorer.27
The variables were extracted at a 0.5 spatial resolution over land. Elevation data at a 0.5
spatial resolution was obtained from JISAO, University of Washington.28
Following New et al., (2002), relative humidity (RH) was estimated using the formula:

17

 =




x 100,

where  is vapour pressure and  is saturated vapour pressure (in hPa) at mean air
temperature T in C, given by:
 = 6.108 exp [17.27  /(237.3 + )] .
Climatic suitability was defined as the coincidence of precipitation accumulation greater
than 80 mm, average temperature between 18C and 32C, and relative humidity greater
than 60% for P. falciparum.24 Suitability for P. vivax was calculated using the same
thresholds with the exception of a lower average temperature limit of 15C.24,29 The
combined values are an indication of the lower limit for potential malaria transmission for
each species.
The mean number of months per year with suitable climate conditions for malaria
transmission was then calculated across 3 continents (Africa, Asia, and the Americas)
according to the dominant parasite present (Africa = P falciparum, other regions = P.
vivax).30The analysis by malaria management status was further subdivided following
country classifications from Newby et al. (2016)31 who classified countries in the following
categories: malaria controlling, malaria eliminating, or malaria free (Figure 13) A time series
was included for the category malaria controlling countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia
(see main text).

Figure 13: Categorisation of countries as malaria-free, eliminating malaria, or controlling
malaria, 2015.31
In addition to management status, the analysis was stratified by elevation to contrast
trends in highland areas (>=1500m) and lowland areas (<1500m). The percentage change
figures reported in the main text were calculated relative to a 1950s baseline (5 year
average, 1950-54 compared to 5 year average, 2013-2017) to illustrate the overall trend
accounting for interannual variability.

Caveats

These results are based on climatic data, not malaria case data. The malaria suitability
climate thresholds used are based on a consensus of the literature. In practice, the optimal
and limiting conditions for transmission are dependent on the particular species of the
parasite and vector.24Control efforts might limit the impact of these climate changes on
malaria or conversely, the climate suitability may either enhance or hamper control
efforts.32

1.4: Climate-sensitive infectious diseases
1.4.1 Climate-sensitive infectious diseases - Vibrio
Context
Vibrio spp. are globally distributed aquatic bacteria that are ubiquitous in warm estuarine
and coastal waters with low to moderate salinity. V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and
non-toxigenic V. cholerae (non-O1/non-O139) are pathogenic in humans. These Vibrio
species are associated with sporadic cases of gastroenteritis, wound infections, ear
infections, or septicaemia in circumscribed localities.
Vibrio ecology, abundances, distributions, and patterns of infection are often strongly
mediated by environmental conditions. Water temperature, salinity, and turbidity predict
the distribution and abundance of V. vulnificus in Chesapeake Bay, with the number of
infections increasing as a result of recent local warming and changes in rainfall.33 Increased
water temperatures also explain outbreaks of Vibrio infections in countries bordering the
Baltic Sea,34 and range expansions in Alaska.35
This indicator focuses on mapping environmental suitability for pathogenic Vibrio spp. in
coastal zones globally (<30km from coast).
Methods:
The indicator uses thresholds of >18C for Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and <30 PSU for
Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). These values were derived on the basis of a consensus in the
literature.36-38 Estimates for SST were obtained from NOAA Optimum Interpolation 1/4
19

Degree Daily Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) Analysis version 2 for the period 1982-2017.
This dataset is provided by the NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD.39 The salinity fields were created from
daily data obtained from Mercator Ocean Reanalysis.40
Here suitability is reported at two levels. First, it was calculated the percentage of coastline
globally that experienced suitable conditions for Vibrio infections and summarised the
results across three latitudinal bands (northern latitudes = 40-70N; tropical latitudes =
25S-40N; and southern latitudes = 25-40S). Second, suitability in two focal regions in
which human Vibrio infection is frequently observed, the Baltic Sea and the northeastern
coast of the United States (36-50N) were calculated. For the Baltic (main text) and
northeastern coast of the United States coast the percentage of coastline suitable for Vibrio
infections are presented. In addition, the number of days per year suitable for outbreaks is
presented for the Baltic (main text). The percentage change figures reported in the main
text were calculated relative to a 1980s baseline (5 year average, 1982-86), either an
average for the 2010s (5 year average, 2014-2018) to illustrate the overall trend accounting
for interannual variability or for the most recent year for which data were available (2018).

Figure 15: Percentage coastline suitable for Vibrio spp., V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus,
and non-toxigenic V. cholerae (non-O1/non-O139), by latitude along the United States
northeast coastal region (36N-50N).
This Latitude-time plot (Hovmoller diagram, Figure 15) indicates poleward expansion of
suitable environments for Vibrio spp. in this region. For latitudes >39 and similarly to the
Baltic Sea, there is a general widening of the Vibrio spp. season as well as an increase in the
amount of shoreline affected.
Caveats

The results are derived on the basis of suitable SST and SSS conditions only, and do not
include other potentially important drivers (e.g. globalisation), environmental predictors of
20

pathogenic Vibrio infections (e.g., cholorphyll-a, turbidity) nor disease case data.
Nevertheless, these associations have been explored and are reported in the supporting
references included above.
In the global analysis, the slope of the trendlines over the time series is mostly flat for the
tropical/subtropical region and the southern Hemisphere. However, the SST-only suitability
shows a strong upward trend in the southern hemisphere, indicating that on average
temperature conditions are also improving growth conditions for Vibrio in these areas,
while SSS is generally limiting. However, locally suitable SSS conditions will also occur in
these regions on the basis of, for example, variation in local rainfall and river runoff, which
can make these regions sporadically suitable for Vibrio infections.

1.4: Climate-sensitive infectious diseases
1.4.1 Climate-sensitive infectious diseases - Vibrio cholerae
Context:
Cholera is a water-borne disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which
generally occurs in brackish riverine, estuarine, and coastal waters (Colwell and Huq
2001). Toxigenic Vibrio cholerae is responsible for epidemic cholera, while non-toxigenic
Vibrio cholerae is responsible for sporadic cases of mild gastroenteritis, but not cholera.
Improvements in water sanitation and health care services (e.g. oral cholera vaccine)
have facilitated the control of cholera worldwide.41 However, the ongoing, 7th cholera
pandemic has an estimated burden of ~2.8 million cases annually that result in ~95,000
deaths per year, mainly in Africa.42
Cholera control is achievable via safe drinking water, vaccines, and effective outbreak
response. Hence, epidemics emerge under scenarios of pathogen introduction, political
instability, war, and extreme water events in already fragile countries. Cholera
prevention requires the understanding of the distribution and availability of its
pathogen, toxigenic Vibrio cholerae, and the role of the environmental conditions that
facilitate or limit V. cholerae emergence and persistence. The abundance of V. cholerae
is associated with increases in SST and phytoplankton in coastal waters.43 Thus, the
distribution V. cholerae sensu lato was reconstructed using an ecological niche modelling
approach linking V. cholerae reports and fine-scale sea surface temperature and
phytoplankton in coastal waters during the last 15 years, assuming niche conservatism
among toxigenic and non-toxigenic lineages.
Methods:
Analyses were performed following the protocols described by Escobar et al. (2015)44 to
estimate suitable sea waters for V. cholerae under climate variability. The environmental
tolerances of V. cholerae were determined based on Escobar et al. (2015) reports of V.
cholerae in coastal waters and an ecological niche model based on sea surface
temperature and chlorophyll-a, which have been found to be main drivers of V. cholerae
occurrence.43-45 Annual mean, range, maximum, and minimum values of these
oceanographic variables were estimated between 2003 and 2018 to compile 15 years of
seawater conditions at 4 km2 cell size in the exclusive economic zone of each country
around the world (Figure 16).
21

Figure 16: Exclusive economic zone of each country around the world.
A distance of ~200 miles was calculated off the coast of each country to resemble the
exclusive economic zone defined by the United Nations with country borders defined
elsewhere (Figure 16).46
Suitable seawater conditions for V. cholerae were determined by estimating the realised
ecological niche of the bacterium. The realised ecological niche was reconstructed by
linking V. cholerae reports with sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a values from
year 2003 as proxies of abiotic and biotic factors respectively.47 Niche models were
developed in a calibration of 100 km around each V. cholerae report as a proxy of the
pathogen's potential dispersal.44 Models were done using Maxent, a machine learning
algorithm.48 The Maxent version integrated in the kuenm package in R was used to
develop a large population of candidate models from which to select the best model.
Candidate Maxent models included different regularisation multipliers (i.e., 0.1, 0.5, 1,
1.5, 2) and diverse combinations of model features (i.e., linear, quadratic, threshold,
product, hinge). The most parsimonious and significant model was selected as best
model.49 Specifically, the best model was selected based on Akaike information
criterion, p-value, and omission rates.49,50

Data

The final 2003 model was then projected to all the consecutive years to generate a timeseries analysis of suitable coastal areas for V. cholerae between 2003 and 2018. Models
were projected using model extrapolation and strict model transference in Maxent.51
The original continuous values of the models (i.e., V. cholerae suitability index ranging
from 0 to ~1) were converted to binary (i.e., suitable or unsuitable for V. cholerae).
Binary models were generated using a threshold of 5% omission rate, which removes 5%
of the lowest calibration values as a proxy of  = 0.05, generally used in statistics.52 The
total area suitable for V. cholerae by country was used as a proxy of cholera transmission
risk. Complementarily, for continuous models, the average V. cholerae suitability index
was estimated by country as a proxy of coastal areas where the bacterium could
successfully establish. Values of suitability were used to generate locally weighted
scatterplot smoothing of risk vs. time.
Data of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a across coastal areas were collected
from the MODIS sensor in the Aqua satellite--launched in 2002 and part of the NASA
Earth Observing System. Data were obtained at 4 km2 spatial resolution and monthly
temporal resolution during the period 2003-2018 and available at

surface temperature and at
https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/erdMH1chlamday.html for
chlorophyll-a. Monthly averages from sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a layers
(i.e., Level 3 MODIS) were used to estimate annual mean, range, maximum, and
minimum values for each variable for each year. These values were used during model
calibration.
Vibrio cholerae is not habitually surveyed in coastal waters or in environmental samples
in general.45 Instead, most V. cholerae reports originate from human cases in inland
areas. The limited number of reports used in this modelling framework could result in an
underestimation of the epidemiological potential of V. cholerae in coastal waters around
the world. To mitigate this limitation, Maxent models were calibrated and projected
allowing extrapolation to reduce overfit to the observed values.
Beyond the presence of toxigenic V. cholerae, cholera epidemics require a number of
non-climate related factors linked to population vulnerability (e.g., WASH failure,
conflict, unsafe drinking water). Thus, this assessment focused in one component of
cholera transmission risk, the plausible environmental suitability for V. cholerae in
coastal waters. Finally, V. cholerae was modelled at the species level, assuming that
toxigenic and non-toxigenic lineages would respond similarly to environmental
conditions.
Sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a conditions in future years will allow to
determine percentages of change and their location in coastal waters around the world.
New satellite-derived data will allow determining whether trends observed in this
analysis are consistent in the coming years.
Results indicate that while some locations show stability or decrease in their suitability
for V. cholerae, overall, a consistent trend to increase V. cholerae's coastal suitability
was detected at global scale, with a particularly strong signal for the past five years.

Methods

This indicator computes adaptive capacity of a given country to manage threats
posed by infectious diseases, taking into account core competency in key areas. The
key areas are in surveillance, legislation, food safety, human resources, laboratory,
point of entry, response, preparedness, risk communication and zoonosis which form
part of International Health Regulations (IHR) Core Capacity Monitoring
Framework.53,54A composite index was computed by taking average of the 11 core

24

competencies. The average core capacities outlined in the monitoring framework has
shown protective to outbreak risk.55
Specifically, this indicator displays how the vulnerability to mosquito-borne outbreaks
transmitted by the Aedes aegypti vectors relates to transmission potential by the
vectorial capacity and systemic resilience to infectious outbreaks by the core
capacities. Its estimated for each country and then aggregated by WHO regions. The
IHR core capacities data covers the period 2010-2017, so trends for this period are
presented. Vulnerability was computed by taking the vectorial capacity (VC)
(including vector abundance which is normalised to range between 0 and 1) and
dividing by the average core capacity of a country.. The formula below is used for the
computation of adaptive capacity.
Vulnerability = Vectorial capacity / average IHR core capacity
The temperature dependent dynamic models developed by Liu-Helmersson et al.
(2014)56 and later updated by Rocklov & Tozan (2019.16 The VC included the
estimated potential abundance of Aedes aegypti vectors. The abundance was
estimated in response to local rainfall and temperature patterns at a daily time scale
as outlined in Liu-Helmersson et al (2019).57
Computation of Aedes aegypti VC and abundance estimates was done for each 0.5 x
0.5 grid cells using the Climatic Research Unit dataset (CRU TS 4.02)11 and
subsequently aggregated to country level using shapefiles.
The CRU TS 4.0211 climate data drives both the VC and the abundance models.

1.5.1: Terrestrial food security and under-nutrition
Actual crop yields vary from year to year not only with variations in weather, but also
with changes in variety, farming practices and the occurrence of pest and disease.
Crop yields as estimated by crop models are sensitive to the precise form of the crop
model, and many models do not account for the short-term extremes that can
significantly affect yields. The effect of year-to-year climatic variability on crop yields
is therefore here represented by an agri-climatological proxy indicator, calculated
from observed climate data and characterising potential variability in yield. Maize,
wheat, rice and soybean were selected as important traded and subsistence crops.
There are several potential proxies for variability from year to year in crop yield,
including the number of hot days during critical periods in the growing season58-61 and
the accumulated temperature between lower and upper thresholds over the growing
season.58 The proxy used here is based on crop duration, defined as the time taken in
a year to accumulate the reference period (1981-2010) average growing season
accumulated temperature total (ATT).58 If the ATT is reached early, then the crop
matures too quickly and yields are lower than average. Here, the crop duration loss
was defined as the difference in the time taken (in days) to accumulate the average
growing season accumulated temperature.

Data

The index is calculated at a spatial resolution of 0.5, across the area of land under
cultivation for each crop.62 The duration of the growing season and the low and high
temperature thresholds for the calculation of ATT vary between crops. Climate data is
taken from the Climate Research Unit TS4 gridded monthly observed climate data
set,11 and synthetic daily data is estimated for each grid cell by applying a regional
average daily anomaly to the monthly value. The regional average daily anomaly is
calculated from the WFDEI daily climatology.63 The plots in the paper show the global
average annual change in crop growth duration. The horizontal dashed line shows the
average difference in crop growth duration over the reference period 1981-2010.
Note that this is not zero because of the non-linear relationship between ATT and the
time taken to accumulate a specific value of ATT.

1.5.2: Marine food security and under-nutrition
Sixteen FAO fishing areas (out of 19; the 3 areas excluded are those located in the
Antarctica) which are important in terms of projected impacts and vulnerabilities
associated with climate change were selected (Table 2 and Figure 21). Sixty-four
countries located in these areas (for which Fish Capture Data is currently available)
were selected in order to attribute the impacts of climate change (more specifically
sea surface temperature; SST) to deterioration of major coral reef sites (Marine
Protected Areas), decreased population of commercial fish species, and the
consequent decreased consumption of capture-based fish.
Data for SST was obtained from NOAA, and covers from 2003 to 2018. The location of
coral reef sites and data on annual maximum bleaching alert area caused by thermal
stress was obtained from NOAA Coral Reef Watch Zones , and is available in five-year
intervals from 1985 to 2018. Data on fish consumption per capita from 1980 to 2016
was collected from FAO.
There is a lack of information in the available databases such as FAO on fish species
composition of the captured and farmed fish products. This could in turn lead to
some concerns about the methodological approach used to calculate 3 intake.
More specifically, most of the approaches are based on fish intake, which usually
ignore or underestimate variations in 3 contents of different types of fishes, and
especially capture-based compared with farmed-based fish.
Figure 19 presents changes in sea surface temperature for the 64 countries
investigated from different basins from 2003 to 2018. Figure 21 presents the global
occurrence zone of coral reefs while Figure 22 reflects the increasing deterioration of
annual maximum Bleaching Alert Area globally and threats to marine primary
productivity being expected to follow. Figure 23 presents the trend of capture-based
per capita fish consumption; a key source of 3 fatty acids (Table 3). Figure 25
conceptualises the relationship between climate change and decreased consumption
of capture-based fish to increased risk of ischemic heart diseases. Between 2003 and
2018, SST rose in 34 of the 64 territorial waters analysed (max. increase 3.5 oC), while
even marginal SST decreases (1 oC) in 19 out of 30 territorial waters (Figure 19)
could be linked to the weakening of a crucial ocean current, i.e., Atlantic Meridional
Overturning Current (AMOC) by 15%, in response to melting ice from Greenland.64,65
Summary exposure value (SEV) is the measure of a population's exposure to a risk
factor that takes into account the extent of exposure by risk level and the severity of
that risk's contribution to disease burden. SEV for "diet low in seafood omega-3 fatty
acids" has increased in most of the investigated countries since 1990; however, there
are countries with decreasing trends in exposure to this risk factor as well (Table 4).
Nevertheless, the total overall number of deaths and disability adjusted life years
(DALYs) attributable to diet low in seafood omega-3 fatty acids, has increased in our
list of investigated countries; with the most populous countries including China,
Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh having major impacts on this overall increase
(Table 5 and Table 6) 66
Given the unfavourable variations in fish capture over the last three decades, it
seems that countries in general have implemented strategies toward increased fish
27

farming to compensate for decreased capture-based per capita fish consumption.
However, owing to the substantially lower 3 contents of farmed fish compared with
captured fish, positive health impacts of this approach is in question. Therefore,
adaptation strategies should be focused on shifting the existing fish farming activities
from fresh water (in-land waters) to marine water (mariculture systems, e.g., cage
culture). Moreover, 3 enrichment in fish farming should also be pursued.

Methods

2: Adaptation, Planning, and Resilience for Health
2.1: Adaptation planning and assessment
2.1.1: National adaptation plans for health
The collection of data for this exercise included a voluntary national survey, the
WHO Health and Climate Change Country Survey (2018) that was sent to all
WHO member states and was completed by ministry of health focal points. Of
the 194 WHO member states, 101 participated in the survey, providing
representation from all 6 WHO regions, World Bank Group-defined income
categories, and a diverse range of threats and vulnerabilities to the health
effects of climate change. Survey participation has grown substantially from
the 40 Member States that completed the 2015 WHO Health and Climate
Change Country Survey.
Validation of the 2018 country reported data was undertaken in multiple steps.
First, survey responses were reviewed for missing information or
inconsistencies with follow-up questions directed to survey respondents A
summary of responses were shared with WHO regional focal points for review
and comments. Source documents including national health strategies and
plans, and scientific assessments of health vulnerabilities and assessments
were collected. A desktop review was conducted to compare with survey
results with follow-up to survey respondents to seek clarification or additional
documentation. In the case of vulnerability and adaptation assessments,
findings were also cross referenced with existing external publications.67
Finally, partial results were reviewed by key national health and climate
stakeholders and ministry of health officials as part of the development and
review of the WHO UNFCCC health and climate change country profiles.
Further information on the WHO Health and Climate Change Country Survey,
its methodology and the WHO UNFCCC Health and Climate Change Country
Profile Initiative can be found at

2018 WHO Health and Climate Country Survey
The survey sample is not a representative sample of all countries as this survey
was voluntary, however, the inclusion of 101 countries in this survey compared
with 40 in the 2015 survey demonstrates a large increase in coverage.
Additionally, the WHO is running a climate change and health special initiative
in Small Island Developing States and there are 26 small island developing
countries and territories represented within the total number of respondents.
The WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will be conducted biennially and
will continue to be the primary source of data to track this indicator.
The future evolution of this indicator will explore the monitoring and review of
the existing strategies/plans and progress on level of implementation of
strategies/plans. With more countries initiating the national adaptation plan
(NAP) process, alignment of the health component with the overall NAP will
also be more closely monitored. Interim information regarding the specific

48

content of national strategies/plans, as explored in this qualitative analysis,
may be re-assessed in the future.

2018 WHO Health and Climate Change Country Survey
The survey sample is not a representative sample of all countries as this survey was

The future evolution of this indicator will explore the coverage and comprehensive
of the assessments, such as the use of qualitative and/or quantitative data and the
use of future projections of risks of climate-sensitive diseases.

questions on emissions, adaptation assessments and plans.
Respondents to the surveys to describe the magnitude of the impact of climate based
hazards (extremely serious, serious, less serious) and identify three critical assets or
services that may be most impacted. Based on this data two indicators can be developed.
The first is a global cities-based indicator of government areas that have undertaken a
climate change risk or vulnerability assessment.

CDP Cities Data
This is a sample survey and cities are under no obligation to respond. As such the survey
may suffer from selection bias. The majority of responding cities are also from High Income
Countries (69%). As such, the results are not representative.
The CDP collect this data annually and it is foreseen that the data collection will continue
to 2030.

2: Adaptation, Planning, and Resilience for Health
2.2: Climate information services for health
The number of World Meteorological Organization (WMO) national member states
(NMS) whose Meteorological and Hydrological services are providing climate
services to the health sector is calculated based on self-reported information
provided by member states to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
through the Country Profile Database Integrated questionnaire. The questionnaire
is one of the main sources of information to the WMO Country Profile data base
51

and is open all year round for WMO members to update their profile information.
Reported data reflects answers to Question number 6.2 of this questionnaire:
"Please indicate which user communities/sectors your NMS provides with climate
products/information and estimate the extent to which these products are used to
improve decisions". "Human Health" is one of multiple sectors which can be
chosen.
Data

World Meteorological Organization Country Profile data base, which can be
consulted online at https://www.wmo.int/cpdb/.

Caveats

The current data source from WMO only considers climate services provided by
NMS. It is unclear the degree to which other providers, such as academic
institutions and research projects, private sector products, products from other
Ministries, or regional and global products and services are being used, in
proportion to services made available by NMS.
The open questionnaire can be updated at any time by WMO members, therefore
the figures here reported may change over the year. As each country may update
their profile information at different moments in time, snap shots do not reflect
progress for any given year but rather information provided until a certain date.
The current questionnaire does not record the number of WMO members that do
not provide climate services to the health sector.
The questionnaire captures information on the provision of climate services, the
status of service provision to the health sector (divided in 5 categories) and the type
of services provided (divided in 5 categories as well). However, only the provision
and status of climate service has been reported here due to uncertainties over the
quality of the data on the type of services provided. Questions do not capture the
source or quality of the service and only one of the answer option covers the utility
of the climate services. They do not capture whether data originates from national
meteorological observations or is resulting from regional or global products. They
do not capture the potential use of all-sector forecasts or outlooks which are
accessed and used by the health sector.
The WMO and WHO have some differences in their individual Member States.
Responses collected from WMO Member States, were reclassified according to
WHO Region. WMO members that are not individual WHO members were excluded
from the analyses and include Macao and Hong Kong (reported as China), Curacao
and St. Maartens. The following WHO Members are not Members of WMO,
therefore representative data is not available: Andorra, Equatorial Guinea, Marshall
Islands, Nauru, Palau, San Marino.

Future Form of
Indicator

WMO will implement new survey instruments in 2019 to provide greater insight on
the status of climate service provision for the health sector, and the type of service
provided. Other complementary WMO surveys capturing specific product types,
user satisfaction, and application areas, may be publicly available in the future to
inform future editions of this indicator.
The World Health Organization (WHO) conducts a regular climate and health
country survey with ministries of health or national health authorities in its 194
Member States. In 2017, this survey added indicators on the inclusion of

2: Adaptation, Planning, and Resilience for Health
2.3: Adaptation delivery and implementation
2.3.1: Detection, preparedness and response to health emergencies
This indicator takes data from the International Health Regulations (IHR (2005))
State Party Self- Assessment Annual Reporting Tool (SPAR).
Under the IHR (2005) all States Parties are required to have or to develop minimum
core public health capacities to implement the IHR (2005) effectively. IHR (2005)
also states that all States Parties should report to the World Health Assembly
annually on the implementation of IHR (2005). In order to facilitate this process,
WHO developed an IHR Monitoring questionnaire, interpreting the Core Capacity
Requirements in Annex 1 of IHR (2005) into 20 indicators for 13 capacities. Since
2010, this self-reporting IHR monitoring questionnaire is sent annually to National
IHR Focal Points (NFPs) for data collection. It contains a checklist of 20 indicators
specifically developed for monitoring the development and implementation of 13
IHR capacities. The method of estimation calculates the proportion/percentage of
attributes (a set of specific elements or functions which reflect the level of
performance or achievement of a specific indicator) reported to be in place in a
country.
The core capacities to implement the International Health Regulations (2005) have
been established by a technical group of experts, as those capacities required to
detect, assess, notify and report events, and to respond to public health risks and
emergencies of national and international concern. To assess the development and
strengthening of core capacities, a set of components are measured for each of the
core capacities, by considering a set of one to three indicators that measure the
status and progress in developing and strengthening the IHR core capacities. Each
indicator is assessed by using a group of specific elements referred to as `attributes'
that represents a complex set of activities or elements required to carry out this
component. The annual questionnaire has been conducted since 2010 with a
response rate of 72% in 2012, 66% in 2016 and 85% in 2017, and 100% of countries
reporting at least once since 2010. Annual reporting results are complemented by
after action reviews, exercises, and joint external evaluation (JEE).

Data

Caveats

At the beginning of 2018, in compliance with the recommendations of the IHR
Review Committee on Second Extensions for Establishing National Public Health
Capacities and on IHR Implementation , and following formal global consultations
with States Parties held in 2015, 2016, and 2017, and 2018, the WHO Secretariat
replaced the IHR Monitoring questionnaire by the "IHR State Party Self-assessment
Annual Reporting (SPAR) Tool". This has strong implication for the future of this
indicator: preparedness and response capacities have now been merged into one
capacity called "C8: National health emergency framework"; one capacity relevant
to climate adaptation and resilience has been added ( "C9: Health services
provision"); and a in change capacity grading has been introduced, which requires
countries to grade their capacity indicators in progressive levels from 1 to 5 as
opposed to the previous "Yes/No/Not know" answers options.
International Health Regulations (2005) Annual Reporting. Data is available through
the Global Health Observatory Data Repository for 2010-2017
http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.IHR?lang=en
And through the SPAR interactive for 2018
http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/ihrspar/atlas7.html?indicator=i
7&amp;geog=0&amp;indicator=i7&amp;date=2018&amp;bbox=312.53597590361454,62.897000000000006,312.53597590361454,90.59700000000002&amp;printmode=
true
There are some limitations to considering these capacities as proxies of healthsystem adaptive capacity and system resilience. Most importantly, IHR monitoring
questionnaires responses are self-reported. Secondly, the countries that report IHR
implementation annually differ from year to year within these regional aggregate
scores. Thirdly, IHR Core Capacity Requirements are not specific to climate change,
and hence whilst they provide a proxy baseline, they do not directly measure a
country's adaptive capacity in relation to climate driven risk changes. Fourthly,
these findings capture potential capacity - not action. Finally, the quality of
surveillance for early detection and warning is not shown and neither is the impact
of that surveillance on public health. Response systems have been inadequate in
numerous public health emergencies and thus the presence of such plans is not a
proxy for their effectiveness. Nonetheless, these four capacities provide a useful
starting point to consider the potential adaptive capacity of health systems globally.

2.3.2: Air conditioning - benefits and harms

Methods

A meta-analysis found having home air conditioning to be the strongest protective
factor against heatwave-related mortality (pooled relative risk [RR] = 0.23; 95%
confidence interval = 0.1 - 0.6; based on 6 studies) and having visited other air
conditioned environments as the second most protective factor (pooled RR = 0.34;
95% confidence interval = 0.2 - 0.5; based on 5 studies).70 Thus, residential air
conditioning is of special interest with regard to protection against heatwaverelated mortality.
The prevented fraction is the percent reduction in an adverse health outcome due
to a preventive exposure, compared with the scenario of complete absence of the
exposure.71 The prevented fraction is determined by two factors: 1) the relative
risk of the adverse health outcome in exposed persons compared with unexposed
persons and 2) the prevalence of the exposure. The prevented fraction increases
with decreasing relative risk and with increasing prevalence of exposure. The
formula for prevented fraction is simply:
Pe(1 - RR)
Where Pe is the prevalence of the exposure and RR is the relative risk of the
adverse health outcome in exposed persons compared with unexposed persons.
For the air conditioning indicator, the prevented fraction is the percent reduction
in heatwave-related deaths due to a given proportion of the population (Pac)
having household air conditioning, compared with a scenario of complete absence
of household air conditioning. Thus, the prevented fraction is simply:
Pac(1 - RR)
As intuitively expected, according to this formula, the higher the protection against
heatwave-related mortality conferred by household air conditioning (i.e., the
lower the relative risk of heatwave-related mortality in persons living in a
household with air conditioning versus persons living in a household without air
conditioning), the greater the prevented fraction; and the higher the proportion of
the population with access to household air conditioning, the greater the
prevented fraction.
Pac was assumed to be the same as the proportion of households with air
conditioning. These data were kindly provided by the International Energy Agency.
Based on the meta-analysis mentioned above, an RR of 0.23 was assumed. Thus,
the formula for prevented fraction is:
61

Pac(1 - RR) = Pac(1 - 0.23) = Pac(0.77)
The prevented fraction could range from 0 for a region with no household air
conditioning (i.e., Pac = 0) to 0.77 for a region in which every household has air
conditioning (i.e., Pac = 1.0). A low prevented fraction does not necessarily
translate into a high absolute number of heatwave-related deaths because in a
given country/region the number of heatwave-related deaths that would occur in
the complete absence of household air conditioning may be low.
To estimate premature deaths from ambient PM2.5 due to electricity use for air
conditioning, country/region-specific premature deaths due to PM2.5 emissions
from power plants were estimated, as described in the appendix for Indicator
3.3.2. Then, country/region-specific data on final energy consumption from air
conditioning, kindly provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA), was used to
calculate the proportion of electricity generation used for air conditioning. This
proportion was applied to the total premature deaths due to PM2.5 emissions from
power plants to estimate the number of premature deaths due to air conditioning.
Data

The IEA kindly provided data on the proportion of households with air conditioning
(used for the prevented fraction calculation), CO2 emissions due to air conditioning
(megatons), and final energy consumption for air conditioning (terawatt hours;
used for the calculation of premature deaths due to PM2.5 from air conditioning) in
the entire world and for major countries/regions.

Caveats

For the prevented fraction calculation, an RR of 0.23 was assumed for heatwaverelated death for persons living in a household with air conditioning versus persons
living in a household without air conditioning, based on a meta-analysis that
included 6 studies, 4 from the United States and 2 from France. This RR may differ
in other parts of the world. Furthermore, the proportion of households with air
conditioning was used to estimate the proportion of the population having
household air conditioning. The estimate did not take into account the size of
households with versus without air conditioning or the vulnerability to heat stress
of persons living in households with versus without air conditioning. Finally, data
limitations prevented the estimation of the absolute number of heatwave-related
deaths prevented by air conditioning.
To estimate premature deaths due to PM2.5 emissions from air conditioning, it was
assumed that in a given country/region, the electricity market is completely
connected, so that the share of electricity used for air conditioning can be equally
applied to power plant emissions throughout the country/region. This assumption
may not be accurate for larger countries/regions.

Future form of
indicator

The meta-analysis of the relationship between living with air conditioning and
heatwave-related (or, more generally, heat-related) mortality will be updated. If
there are sufficient studies, morbidity will also be examined. The indicator may be
updated each year as new data becomes available. City-level case studies to
estimate absolute number of lives saved from air conditioning versus premature
deaths from exposure to PM2.5 due to air conditioning may also be performed.
Additionally, national building codes, minimum energy performance standards and
labeling rules for air conditioners, and progress on implementing the Kigali
Amendment may be tracked in the future.

2: Adaptation, Planning, and Resilience for Health
2.4: Spending on adaptation for health and health-related activities
The `Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change' dataset is the same data
source that used in the 2017 and 2018 Lancet Countdown reports.1,72 It
measures spending on economic activities related to adaptation and resilience
to climate change. It was developed by data research firm kMatrix73 in
partnership with numerous stakeholders, and includes the key adaptation
measures identified by the IPCC. This classification of adaptation activities was
originally developed from attempts by the UK Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs to measure adaptation in 2009/201074. The definition of
adaptation activities was extended through collaboration with the Greater
London Authority in 2014, and updated through a project with Climate-KIC in
2017. This added several new industrial sectors as well as significantly expanding
the activities under health and healthcare.
The methodology used for data acquisition and analysis is based on a system
called as `profiling', which was originally developed at Harvard Business School
to track and analyse technical and industrial change.75 This is the basis for
building taxonomies of economic activities and value chains, which can then be
populated with estimates of key economic metrics like sales value and
employment by triangulating transactional and operational business data to
estimate economic values. This methodology is particularly valuable in areas
where government statistics and standard industry classifications are not
available.76 When measuring an industry or sector, the new taxonomy is

65

populated from the bottom up, searching for evidence for the ideal definition
and including only economic activities where sufficient evidence is available.
For each transaction listed in the adaptation economy data, a minimum of seven
separate sources must independently record the transaction for it to be
confirmed and included in the database. Triangulating data from multiple
sources permits large volumes of unsorted, fragmented data of different types
from different sources to be processed to arrive at more accurate estimates of
transactional value that would not be possible using a single source. For the
adaptation economy, data is produced to a confidence level of around 80%.
Accessing and analysing multiple types of data is also key to identifying the
`purpose' behind an economic activity, which is key for accurately assigning
economic activities to the adaptation dataset.
Developing the new definition of adaptation and resilience to climate change
involved the top-down taxonomy of the entire `make and mend' economy, and
then adaptation and resilience in all forms. Then these categories were filtered
to isolate economic activities that can be strictly identified as being relevant to
adaptation and resilience to climate change. The taxonomy of A&RCC is drawn
from 11 sectors of the economy at-large: Agriculture & Forestry, Built
Environment, Disaster Preparedness, Energy, Health/Health Care, ICT, Natural
Environment, Professional Services, Transport, Waste and Water.74,77
There are a number of activities across different sectors that are `health-related'
in the adaptation and resilience to climate change dataset, outside of the
strictly-defined healthcare sector. The indicator design therefore required the
definition of those activities from the other 10 sectors of the A&RCC data that
can be clearly related to health, and thus should be included in a definition of
`health-related' adaptation spending. The robust interim approach used for the
2017 and 2018 Lancet Countdown was again adopted for this year's Lancet
Countdown. The 'health-related' activities consists of the activities of the
Healthcare/Health Sector, Disaster Preparedness and Agriculture adaptation
activities from the kMatrix dataset. A methodology is under development to
define a full health-related adaptation definition across the entire A&RCC
dataset, and an initial definition of an expanded health-related adaptation
classification has been proposed.

Data

Geographical Coverage:
The A&RCC dataset has global coverage for 226 countries and territories. Data
has been reported for a subset of countries and territories for whom adaptation
spending data, regional and income classifications, and population estimates are
available. This year's indicator covers 191 countries and territories with data
reported in the A&RCC dataset, and that are assigned a region in the WHO
regional classification and an income group in the World Bank income group
classification.78 Per Capita values are based on 183 countries that also have
population estimates from the IMF World Economic Outlook.79

Caveats

Future Form of
Indicator

For comparability, global total values present the global total for countries or
territories that are included in the regional and world bank analysis. It does not
include the 35 countries and territories which have neither a WHO Region nor a
World Bank Income Group. Most of these are overseas territories or subnational jurisdictions with relatively lower levels of adaptation spending.
However, several larger states or jurisdictions that are not included in this global
total are: Hong Kong, Taiwan and Puerto Rico.
Economic activity or transactions are only measured where there is an economic
`footprint', i.e. where there is transactional/financial data available to be
measured. Therefore, public sector spending without an economic `footprint'
(government spending on salaries, for example), cannot be measured. It also not
possible to directly identify what percentage of measured spending is public
versus private. Values are not currently adjusted for inflation. Values of sales
generated are not directly comparable with values derived from national
statistics.
The reference period is the financial years 2015/16 to 2017/18. Further historical
data could be available in the future.
There will be three major developments in the future form of the indicator.
The first will be the development of the `three-tier' definition of:
1) Adaptation activities with direct, important health impacts;
2) Those with less direct or more minor health impacts;
3) Those with no health impact or too tenuous a health impact.
Secondly, in the future it is likely to possible to present historical data for the
indicator, in order to provide trend data on change in spend over time.
Finally, in the future the aim is to develop an indicator of adaptation spending as
a percentage of the overall health sector spend and health-related spend as a
percentage of the entire economy (represented by 24 industries), compiled
using transactional data.

3: Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits
3.1: Energy system and Health
3.1.1: Carbon intensity of the energy system
This indicator contains two components:
1. Carbon intensity of the energy system, both at global and regional
scales, (1972-2016), in tCO2/TJ; and
2. Global CO2 emissions from energy combustion by fuel, in GtCO2 (19722017). Global emissions without fuel breakdown are also provided for
2018. This sub-indicator is complimented by scenario values for 2050 of
CO2 emissions.
The technical definition of carbon intensity is the tonnes of CO emitted for each
unit (TJ) of primary energy supplied.
The rationale for the indicator choice is that carbon intensity of the energy
system will provide information on the level of fossil fuel use, which has
associated air pollution impacts. Higher intensity values indicate a more fossil
dominated system, and one that is likely to have a higher coal share. As
countries pursue climate mitigation goals, the carbon intensity is likely to reduce
with benefits for air pollution.
The indicator is calculated based on total CO2 emissions from fossil fuel
combustion divided by Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES). TPES reflects the
total amount of primary energy used in a specific country, accounting for the
flow of energy imports and exports.
The data is available for most countries of the world, for the period 1971-2016.

Data

Caveats

Future Form
of Indicator
Additional
information

Future CO2 emissions for 2050 are taken from the IIASA hosted scenario
database containing Integrated Assessment Model scenarios used in the IPCC
SR1.5 report.80
This indicator is based on based on the IEA dataset, CO2 Emissions From Fuel
Combustion: CO2 Indicators, accessed via the UK data service.81
Future emission values from Huppmann et al. 2018.80
The indicator does not provide information on the share of different fossil fuels,
their use in different sectors, and the absolute levels of usage. These are all
important elements in understanding the air pollution emissions, and their
impacts. Therefore, additional indicators (3.1.2 & 3.1.3) provide additional
complimentary information.
This indicator will need to be updated to provide the data for the most recent
years, which have seen important shifts in the use of fossil fuels, particularly
coal.
This year's report includes data to 2016, supplemented with additional statistics
for 201782 and 2018,83 and shows that global emissions of CO2 from fuel
combustion, having been flat between 2014-16, have increased since that period,
reaching a new high of 33.1 GtCO2 in 2018.83 This 2.6% increase over the last two
68

years is due to continued growth in energy demand, most of which is met by fossil
fuels.
As shown in Figure 32 below, these emissions need to fall (from 2019) at a rate of
around 7.4% every year to get to levels in 2050 consistent with the 1.5C target.
The carbon intensity of the system also needs to reduce to near zero by 2050. In
the last 15 years, carbon intensity has largely plateaued, as the growth of low
carbon energy is insufficient to displace fossil fuels to start to bend the intensity
curve downwards. In primary energy terms, low carbon energy accounted for 19%
of total demand in 2018, down from 20% in 2000. Based on recent IEA data in the
last couple of years, carbon intensity is reported to have reduced a small amount
in the last couple of years due to displacement of coal by gas.83
The challenge of reducing CO2 emissions from the energy system, and achieve the
resulting gains for global health, will require enormous political will and both
supply and demand side policies. For example, even if all coal was removed from
the power generation sector today and replaced with low carbon electricity,
carbon intensity would reduce from approximately 57 to 41 tCO2/TJ, and
emissions by about one-third. While reducing coal is key, the other sources of gas
and oil in the system are critical to address.

3: Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits
3.1: Energy system and health
3.1.2: Coal phase-out
Two indicators are used here:
1. Total primary coal supply by region / country (in EJ units); and
2. Share of electricity generation from coal (% of total generation from
coal).
The first indicator is complimented by scenario values of coal use for 2050.
These indicators are important to enable tracking of changes in coal
consumption at a regional and country level. Due to the level of coal used for
power generation, a second indicator tracks the contribution to electricity
generation from coal power plants in selected countries. As countries pursue
climate mitigation goals, the use of coal is likely to reduce with resulting
benefits for air pollution.
The indicator on primary energy coal supply is an aggregation of all coal types
used across all sectors (from the IEA energy balances). The data is available for
most countries of the world, for the period 1978-2017, with global data
provided for 2018.
The indicator on the share of electricity generation from coal is estimated based
on electricity generated from coal plant as a percentage of total electricity
generated. Regional data is available from 1990-2016, with global share
estimated for 2017; pre-1990 data is not used due to incomplete time series.
Countries or regions with large levels of coal use (as a share of generation, or in
absolute terms), have been selected to show in the figures.

Data

Caveats

Future Form of
Indicator
Additional
information

Future coal use and generation estimates for 2050 are taken from the IIASA
hosted scenario database containing Integrated Assessment Model scenarios
used in the IPCC SR1.5 report.
This indicator is based on the extended energy balances from the International
Energy Agency. The specific dataset is called World Extended Energy Balances,
and is sourced via the UK data service.84

Future coal use values are based on scenarios are sourced from Huppmann et al.
2018.80
These indicators provide a proxy for air quality emissions associated with the
combustion of coal. Further work is required to convert coal use by sector and
type into emissions of different air quality pollutants.
As per 3.1.1, this indicator will need to be updated to provide the data for the
most recent years, which have seen important shifts in the use of coal.
While the share of coal in primary energy continues to fall, the overall growth in
global energy demand means coal has returned to a growth trajectory since 2016,
70

and continues to be the second largest contributor to global primary energy (after
oil) and the largest source of electricity generation (at 38%, compared to gas, the
next highest at 23%. Most of this growth is in the Asian region, notably in China,
India and South-East Asia (Figure 33).
Returning to the downward trend in coal demand and then accelerating will be
critical to meeting the climate goals embodied in the Paris Agreement. As shown
in Figure 34, to push towards the 1.5C target, coal use levels need to be at 23 EJ
(median level) by 2050, compared to 157 EJ in 2017, reducing at a year-on-year
rate of 5.6%.
If coal is to be phased out, a key sector to tackle will be power generation, which
accounted for an estimated 64% in 2017 of total coal use.82 Since 2016, coal
generation has increased, while the share of generation remains at around 38%,
as it has been since 2005 (Figure 33). Reductions in generation in other regions
such as Europe and the USA have continued, but have been counterbalanced by
increases in other regions. Using the scenarios that informed the IPCC SR1.5
report, rather than increasing, coal generation, a year-on-year reduction rate of
9% is required to achieve levels consistent with 1.5C pathways (Figure 35). For a
global fleet of just over 2000 GW, almost half of which is in China, this requires a
net reduction per year of 60 GW. It is worth noting that the UK has seen 20% year
on year reductions in coal generation since 2010, highlighting what can be
achieved albeit for a specific country.85
If coal phase-out can be sustained, it is likely to have significant air pollution cobenefits (Indicator 3.3), which in turn help offset the policy costs of mitigation.
Some positive signs are emerging. First, a slowdown in capacity expansion, with
a recent analysis by the Carbon Brief estimating only a net 20 GW increase in
2018.86 Second, other generation options are becoming cheaper than coal,
notably solar, particularly in countries such as India. Finally, the metrics
monitoring plants in the planning pipeline are all in decline, while retirements
continue at pace in specific regions e.g. USA, UK.87
As outlined in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report,1 some political momentum
has gathered, in pledging coal phase out, such as the countries in the Powering
Past Coal Alliance (PPCA).88 Crucial to the success of phasing coal out will be the
policies in China and India, and the extent to which they will draw down on new
investment, and start replacing existing capacity.

3: Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits
3.1: Energy system and health
3.1.3: Zero-carbon emission electricity
Two indicators are used here, and presented in two ways:
1. Total low carbon electricity generation, in absolute terms (TWh) and as
a % share of total electricity generated (to include nuclear, and all
renewables); and
2. Total renewable generation (excluding hydro), in TWh, and as a %
share of total electricity generated.
The increase in the use of low carbon and renewable energy for electricity
generation will push other fossil fuels, such as coal, out of the mix over time,
resulting in an improvement in air quality, with benefits to health.
The renewables (excluding hydro) indicator has been used to allow for the
tracking of rapidly emergent renewable technologies. For both indicators,
generation, rather than capacity, has been chosen as a metric as the electricity
generated from these technologies is what actually displaces fossil-based
generation. Countries with large levels of low carbon generation (as shares, or
in absolute terms), or with higher fossil dependency, have been selected.
The data is again taken from the IEA extended energy balances.84 The absolute
level indicators are total gross electricity generated aggregated from the
relevant technology types. The share indicators are estimated as the low
carbon or renewable generation as a % of total generation.

73

The data is available for most countries of the world, for the period 1971-2016.
Only the period from 1990 has been used, due to data gaps for selected
countries prior to 1990.

Future renewable energy use values are based on scenarios are sourced from
Huppmann et al. 2018.80
This indicator set does not provide information on the air pollutant emissions
displaced due to the increasing share of RE generation.
This set should be developed to include an indicator to assess the direct impact
on air quality emissions from additional low carbon generation, one approach
being to compare the emission intensity of the current system with a
counterfactual case, which does not have the additional share of RE
generation.
With the power sector accounting for 38% of total energy-related CO2
emissions, the importance of renewables for displacing fossil fuels is crucial. In
2016, low carbon electricity globally accounted for 32% of total global
electricity, with continued gains in China (see main report). As costs continue
to fall, solar generation continues to grow at remarkable rates of around 30%
but still only accounts for 2% of total generation.
The types of generation levels from renewables across 1.5C compliant
scenarios are shown in Figure 36. It highlights that generation from new
renewables (solar, wind, geothermal, ocean) need to increase by 9.7% per
annum, to a level in 2050 that is larger than the total global generation today.
Since 1990, the annual growth rate for these renewables was over 14%. To
maintain the momentum in renewable generation growth, there is a need to
ensure that all new generation growth is provided for by non-fossil fuel
sources, with strong supply side policies to prevent investment in coal and gas.

3.2: Access and use of clean energy
The 2019 report presents a combination of data from both the Sustainable
Development Goal 7, and fuel consumption in the residential sector produced
by the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Access to energy is defined by the IEA (2019) as:
"a household having reliable and affordable access to both clean cooking
facilities and to electricity, which is enough to supply a basic bundle of energy
services initially, and then an increasing level of electricity over time to reach
the regional average".89
Within SDG 7.1.2 (proportion of population with primary reliance on clean
fuels and technology) "Clean" fuels are defined by emission rate targets and
specific fuel recommendations included in the WHO guidelines for indoor air
quality.90
This indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO.
Estimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban and rural population
for a given year are obtained separately using a multilevel model91 done at the
country level.
The use of energy in the residential sector is drawn from the IEA extended
global residential modelling produced in the World Energy Outlook from the
`World Extended Energy Balances' 2018 edition,84 which covers all countries or
major regions in the world. The values are measured in PJ and cover all fuels
consumed within the residential sector final energy demand. Here, at point of
final energy demand, clean energy includes electricity (independent of
generation source), solar thermal and geothermal.

75

The data provided in the 2019 report focus on energy use, as compared to
access, as a measure of action to achieving the intent of SDG 7.1.2. The data is
summarised for a selection of countries and the globe.
Data

The SDG indicator is based on data from the UN SDG database.92
The additional energy usage and access is based on data from the IEA World
Energy Balances 2018.84
The energy access data is from the IEA energy access database.93
The data on household fuel use for cooking was provided by the WHO.

Caveats

The data from the IEA on residential energy flows and energy access provide an
indication of both the access to electricity and the proportion of the different
types of energy used within the residential sector. These provide an important
picture on how access and use might be interacting.

Future Form of
Indicator

This indicator provides a better representation of the fuel mix used by
households for different demands (heating, cooling, cooking, hot water,
lighting and other plug loads) for the mix of income groupings at the country
level. Future work will be done to disaggregate and look at access among
vulnerable communities.

Methods

This indicator quantifies contributions of individual source sectors to ambient PM2.5
exposure in cities worldwide. Coal has been highlighted as a fuel across all sectors.
Estimates of sectoral source contributions to annual mean exposure to ambient PM2.5
were calculated using the GAINS model,94 which combines bottom-up emission
calculations with atmospheric chemistry and dispersion coefficients.
Energy statistics are taken from the IEA World Energy Outlook 2017,95 merged with
GAINS information on application of emission control technologies and their emission
factors.
Atmospheric transfer coefficients are based on full year simulations with the EMEP
Chemistry Transport Model96 at 0.5x0.5 resolution using meteorology of 2015 and
include a downscaling to capture sub-grid urban concentration gradients for
approximately 5000 cities over 100,000 inhabitants globally.
Calculated ambient PM2.5 concentrations have been validated against in-situ
observations from the latest version of the WHO's Urban Ambient Air Pollution
Database (2016 update),97 and other sources where available (e.g. Chinese statistical
yearbook). Also, numbers compare well with the SHUE dataset presented in Lancet
Countdown 2018.1
For technical reasons, there are three deviations in the aggregation of countries versus
the WHO regions:
Sudan is included in the `African Region' here, but belongs to WHO Eastern
Mediterranean Region.
Somalia is included in the `African Region' here, but belongs to WHO Eastern
Mediterranean Region.
Algeria is included in the `Eastern Mediterranean' here, but belongs to WHO African
Region.

Caveats

The indicator relies on model calculations.
Validation is only possible for a limited set of cities where observations are available.
These are scarce particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

Future
development
of indicator

An ideal indicator would provide a marker of benefits for air quality and/or health that
are directly attributable to climate change mitigation action, which requires scenario
analysis. Going beyond coal, a more explicit quantification of effects of fossil-fuel
versus non-fossil fuel based activities could be undertaken.

Premature deaths from total ambient PM2.5 for regions other than Europe
are calculated using the methodology of the WHO (2016) assessment on
the burden of disease from ambient air pollution,99 which relies on disease
specific integrated exposure response relationships (IERs) developed within
the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study.100 Disease and age specific
baseline mortality rates are taken from the GBD Results database.101 For
Europe, this indicator follows the WHO Europe methodology and apply
dose-response relationships for all-cause mortality among population over
30 years of age as reported under the REVIHAAP assessment.102 (WHO,
2013). Details are described in Kiesewetter et al. (2015).98
Attribution of estimated premature deaths from AAP to polluting sectors
was done proportional to the contributions of individual sectors to
population-weighted mean PM2.5 in each country.
PM2.5 concentrations for 2008 and 2016 were applied to a fixed 2015
population to estimate the differences in PM2.5 attributable mortality due
to emission changes only.
For technical reasons, there are three deviations in the aggregation of
countries compared with the WHO regions, as described for indicator
3.3.1.
Caveats

The indicator relies on model calculations which are currently available for
a limited set of regions (Europe, South Asia, East Asia).
Uncertainty in the shape of integrated exposure-response relationships
(IERs) make the quantification of health burden inherently uncertain.
Different dose-response relationships are used for Europe (REVIHAAP,
recommended by WHO-Europe) and Asia (WHO-Global).
The non-linearity of the IERs used for non-European countries complicates
the translation between the mortality burden attributed to an individual
source, which is calculated proportional to the source contribution to
ambient PM2.5, and the effect of mitigating this source. While a reduction
of emissions would lead to a (roughly) proportional reduction of ambient
PM2.5, this would not necessarily result in a proportional reduction of the
health burden. In highly polluted environments, the health benefits of a
marginal reduction of emissions would be disproportionately smaller than
the relative change in concentrations.

Future
development of
indicator

Other health indicators than premature deaths should be included for a
more complete assessment of the health burden, particularly Years of Life
Lost (YLLs) and Years Lived with Disability (YLDs).
An ideal indicator would provide a marker of benefits for air quality and/or
health that are directly attributable to climate change mitigation action,
which requires scenario analysis. Going beyond coal, a more explicit
quantification of effects of fossil-fuel versus non-fossil fuel based activities
could be undertaken.

3: Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits
3.4: Sustainable and healthy transport
This indicator contains two components:
1. Clean fuel use for transport; and
2. Cycling as a modal share of transport.
Fuel use data (by fuel type) from the IEA datasets are divided by
corresponding population statistics from the World Bank.

Data

Data on travel mode shares from the TEMS tool was cross-referenced
with cities that have signed up to the Charter of Brussels, an initiative to
encourages cities to target a 15% bicycle modal share by 2020. The tool
contains data on approximately 500 cities with more than 100,000
inhabitants, most of which are in Europe.
Fuel use data is based on data from the IEA (2016), Global EB Outlook
2016: Beyond one million electric cars.103
Data on cycling mode shares obtained from The EPOMM Modal Split
(TEMS) tool, developed by the European Platform on Mobility
Management.104

Caveats

The TEMS data provides estimates for broad mode types (car, public
transport, bike, walk) for a limited number of cities only.
The data record mode shares as trips rather than distances travelled.
The data represent annual averages for a relatively limited number of
years (the number of years of data varies between cities).

Future Form of
Indicator

An ideal fuel use indicator would capture the direct health impacts of the
use of transport fuels, with country- and urban-level specificity within
the global coverage. In turn, the co-benefits of transitioning to lesspolluting fuels would be quantified directly in terms of reduced
exposures to air pollution and their corresponding health impact.
To more fully capture sustainable uptake a future indicator could collate
information on the proportion of total distance travelled by different
modes of transport based on comprehensive local survey data. Other
data on sustainable travel infrastructure, for instance the presence of
cycle schemes, would also be useful.

The emissions per head are divided into world regions (as in the GLOBIOM
model) and, for ruminants, livestock system. To convert to country
values, a weighted average of the livestock numbers in all regions is taken.
To obtain the emissions from cut and grazed grasslands, the fertilizer
applied to grassland and forage use efficiency from Chang et al (2016) is
used.107
For Crops:
The emissions from fertilizer, rice cultivation and cultivation from organic
soils (eg peatland) for maize, rice, wheat, soybean and other crops for the
year 2000 are obtained from the study by Carlson et al. (2017),108 which use
IPCC methodology and a non-linear N2O emission model.
Data from the FAO for emissions from fertilizer, rice cultivation and
cultivation from organic land was obtained from 2000-2016.106 The rate of
increase/decrease for the years 2001-2016 in relation to 2000 are
calculated. This rate is then applied to the data derived from Carlson et al.
(2017)108 to obtain values from 2000-2016.
Caveats

For livestock, data on stock numbers has been extracted from the FAO
database, however, some data is missing for some years, most notably
Somalia (missing data 2000-2011) for non-dairy cattle. Data on grazing
emissions from small islands is also missing.
The emission factors differ from FAO numbers:
* For livestock, this is due to calculation of emissions of enteric
fermentation, manure management and manure left on pasture
at Globiom region (n=29) and livestock system (n=8) level whereas
the FAO use subcontinental (n=9) and climatic level (n=3).106
* For crops, this is due to the FAO assuming slightly higher synthetic
N application, greater manure N inputs, and a linear emissions
factor of 1%, in contrast to a mean of 0.77% used by the nonlinear model of Carlson et al. (2017).108

Additional
information

The overall emissions from livestock has increased by 14% from 2000 to
2016. Enteric fermentation (67%) has the highest contribution to total
livestock emissions, followed by manure management (17-18%), manure
left on pasture (14%) and grassland fertilizer (1%) (Figure 40). The majority
of the temporal increase in emissions is attributed to manure left on
pasture, enteric fermentation and manure management which have
increased by 17%, 15% and 12% respectively from 2000 to 2016, whereas
the emissions from grassland fertilizer has only increased by 2%.

82

As ruminants emit methane via enteric fermentation they have the highest
emissions of all livestock (93% of total). This is split between non-dairy
cattle (62-65%), followed by dairy cattle (10-12%), goats and sheep (1011%) and buffalo (8%). Emissions from non-ruminants are divided between
pigs (5%) and poultry (1-2%). The largest increase in emissions from 2000
to 2016 was poultry (58%), followed by non-dairy cattle (28%), small
ruminant (23%), buffalo (22%), pigs (10%) and non-dairy (10%).
The overall emissions from crops have increased by 10% from 2000 to 2016.
Fertilizer (21-25%) has the lowest contribution to total crop emissions,
followed by cultivation of organic soils (27-29%) and rice cultivation (4750%) (Figure 41). The majority of the temporal increase in emissions is
attributed to emissions from fertilizer, which have increased by 30% from
2000 to 2016, whereas the emissions from rice and organic soil cultivation
have only increased by 3% and 9%, respectively.
As rice produces methane in addition to fertilizer application, it has the
highest emissions of all crops (52-55% of total), followed by wheat (6-7%),
maize (5%) and soybean (1%). The largest increase in emissions from 2000
to 2016 is attributed to wheat (21%), followed by maize (19%) and soybean
(12%) whereas emissions from rice have only increased by 5%. The majority
of the increases are due to fertilizer emissions which have increased by
between 25 and 40% while emissions from cultivation of organic soils have
only increased by between 0 and 2% for the named crops.

Indicator
Methods

3: Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits
3.6: Healthcare sector emissions
This indicator is in the form of healthcare-associated GHG emissions per capita
per year.
Results are calculated by assigning aggregate national health expenditures from
WHO to final demand for `Health and Social Work' in the WIOD or EXIOBASE
multi-region input-output (MRIO) models. Satellite environmental accounts are
appended to each MRIO model, and GHG emissions are calculated using the
standard Leontief inverse technique.
This method provides an aggregate GHG emissions result for all types of
healthcare expenditures. It is possible to produce a disaggregated estimate
that differentiates among expenditure categories, such as hospitals, research,
public health, and so on, as has been done for other national-level studies and
a recent international comparison.109-112 One method to do this would be to
use expenditure accounts that are themselves already disaggregated. The OECD
provides disaggregated health expenditures, but this data set is limited in its
geographic coverage. In order to maintain a global scope, WHO expenditure
data was preferred, with the trade-off of reduced sector resolution. A second
method to create disaggregated results would be to use the supply-use data
embedded in the MRIO models themselves to determine expenditures of each
national `Health and Social work' sector to all other sectors in the model, rather
than relying on data that are independently reported to the WHO. This method
has the advantage of high resolution but the disadvantage that Social Work
expenditures would also be included, adding uncertainty to the results. A
second disadvantage is that the WIOD and EXIOBASE only have full supply-use
models for ~40 countries, which would again limit the geographic scope of the
results. Other MRIO models such as EORA have higher granularity and covers
190 countries, but its environmental accounts only cover CO2 and not the other
GHGs.
Results for years after the MRIO model year are achieved through deflation of
expenditure data. WIOD tables are in US dollars. For model years after 2011,
84

WHO expenditure data in current US dollars is deflated to $2011 using the US
consumer price index from the World Bank. EXIOBASE tables are in euro. For
model years after 2007, WHO expenditure data in current US dollars is
converted to current national currencies using current market exchange rates,
deflated in national currencies to 2007 using consumer price indices from the
World Bank, and converted to 2007 using 2007 market exchange rates.
Data

Environmentally extended multi-region input-output tables:
* WIOD 2013 release with environmental accounts, latest model year
2011, latest emissions account year 2009, air emissions include CO2,
CH4, N2O, NOx, SOx, CO, NMVOC, and NH3;
* EXIOBASE version 2.2, latest model and emissions account year 2007,
GHG emissions include CO2, CH4, N2O. This is not the most recent
version of EXIOBASE, but was chosen as EXIOBASE 3.4 produced health
care sector GHG emissions intensity results for the US in 2011 that
were less than half of those of the national USEEIO model developed by
the USEPA, a discrepancy that could not be reconciled.
Per capita health expenditure data and health expenditure as % of national
GDP is from the World Health Organization's Global Health Expenditure
Database.113 Population data is also from the WHO.114
Market exchange rates are from UN Statistics Division.115
Consumer price indices are from the World Bank.116

Caveats

As only total health expenditure data is available from WHO, all expenditures
are assigned to Final Demand, with no separation for investment.
MRIO models are retrospective and do not intrinsically account for changes in
economic structure or emissions intensities (e.g., for electricity) that have
occurred in the intervening period.

Future Form of
Indicator

Additional
information

Results will not reflect individual healthcare systems' power purchase
agreements for renewable energy; nor are emissions of waste anaesthetic
gases, as these are not currently reported consistently to national governments
and are not considered in environmental accounts.
This indicator could be updated with improved EE-MRIO models in future years.
For example, the addition of non-CO2 GHGs to the EORA full model would
enable global coverage with additional resolution of expenditures within the
healthcare sector.
This is the first year that results are being presented for this indicator.
Healthcare GHG emissions can be differentiated between those that occur
domestically and those that occur in other countries. In the indictor results,
countries also show wide variation in the location of healthcare GHG emissions,
with the Russian Federation showing the highest proportion of emissions
occurring domestically (88%) and Luxembourg showing the least (12%) (Figure
42).

4.1: Economic Losses due to Climate-Related Events
The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the 2018
Lancet Countdown report appendix.1 Munch Re NatCatSERVICE provided the data
for this indicator.117 The NatCatSERVICE is a global database of natural catastrophe
data. This has developed into one of the world's most comprehensive databases for
information on natural catastrophe loss events. Data suitable for systematic and
analytical evaluation on a worldwide scale are available from 1980 onwards. For
this paper, data from 1990 are presented in order to align with the base year
against which GHG emission reduction targets are commonly set.
NatCatSERVICE collect a range of information for around 1,200 events each year.
For this paper only data on direct economic loss (physical/tangible losses), insured
losses (all paid-out insured physical/tangible losses) are used. Further information
can be found in the online NatCatSERVICE Methodology document.118
Table 14: Peril classification as classified by NatCatSERVICE.118below illustrates the
`peril classification' provided by NatCatSERVICE. Perils classified as Meteorological,
Hydrological and Climatological have been included in the analysis. Geophysical
perils are excluded, due to their general independence from climate change.

Each natural catastrophe event recorded is assigned a direct economic loss, and
where applicable, an insured loss. Where these are available, data is taken from
official institutions, but where not, estimates are calculated. The process for
estimation depends on what data is available. For example, if loss estimates from
insurance market data is available, this data may be combined with data on
insurance penetration and other event-specific information to estimate total
economic losses. If only low-quality information is available, such as a description
of the number of homes damaged or destroyed, assumptions on value and costs
are made.
Loss values are presented in US$, or if initially expressed in local currency,
converted to US$ using the market exchange rates at the end of the month when
the event occurred. Once data was received from the NatCatSERVICE economic
losses (insured and uninsured) were divided by annual GDP values for each income
grouping, sourced from the World Bank Database.
Loss values for 1990-2016 were provided by MunichRe in US$2016 terms. GDP data
taken from the World Bank Database were inflated to US$2016 terms to carry out
the losses/$1000 GDP calculation. For 2017 onwards, data for both economic losses
and GDP are sourced in current terms. For this paper, updated GDP values for
2016, 2017 and 2018 have been used.
Munch Re NatCatSERVICE.117
An ideal form of this indicator would allow attribution of fatalities and economic
losses to events induced by climate change. However, such attribution is unlikely to
be feasible over the course of the Lancet Countdown. As such, it is not envisaged
that this indicator will significantly alter.

4: Economics and Finance
4.2: Economic costs of air pollution
This indicator is based on estimates of total Years of Life Lost (YLL) in each member state
of the European Union, resulting from PM2.5 exposure from emissions anthropogenic
sources, assuming consistent levels of emissions and subsequent population exposure to
2115, integrated across the lifetime of the population present in 2015.
The calculations are performed by the GAINS integrated assessment model (see
Kiesewetter et al (2015) for a full description of the model and how YOLLs are
estimated.98
-

-

YLLs are calculated based on the loss of life expectancy from all-cause mortality from
ambient PM2.5 exposure resulting from anthropogenic sources, using dose-response
relationships following the WHO Europe methodology,102 with population cohort
exposure kept constant across lifetimes
Calculations are based on the population structure present in 2010, using data
extracted from UN life tables. However, 2015 population numbers are used to
calculate total YLLs from the calculated reduction in life expectancies.

-

-

Increased health risk from PM2.5 exposure occurs once population cohorts reach 30
years old with younger cohorts only included once they reach this age, (maximum age
= 100). Consequences for new additions to the population are not considered.
Energy production and consumption statistics are taken from the IEA Energy statistics
are taken from the IEA World Energy Outlook 2017,95 merged with GAINS information
on application of emission control technologies and their emission factors.

Total YLLs in each country and year are then multiplied by an estimated `Value of a Life
Year' (VLY), which is taken to be 50,000 for all countries, for all population cohorts,
following the lower bound estimate suggested by Part III of the 2009 European Union
Impact Assessment Guidelines.119 Average annual values are then calculated by dividing
the product of this calculation by 100.

Calculations for Europe are described in detail by Kiesewetter et al. (2015).98

Caveats

See Indicator 3.3.2, for caveats related to the calculation of reduced life expectancy.

Future
Form of
Indicator

There is relatively little literature attempting to estimate a VLY, and with such literature
that does exist largely focussing on European countries. The value employed by this
indicator (50,000) is the lower bound estimate suggested for use by the 2009 European
Union Impact Assessment Guidelines, with the upper value set at 100,000. As such, it is
possible that the values presented by this indicator are conservative, however given the
relative lack of evidence and complexity in producing estimates for VOLYs, it is difficult to
make such a conclusion with confidence.
In future, this indicator will be developed to reflect the actual economic value of health
consequences of annual changes in PM2.5 exposure, rather than of reduced life
expectancy from assumed constancy of exposure across lifetimes. The indicator may also
be expanded to cover areas outside the European Union.

4.3.1: Investment in new coal capacity
The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the
2018 Lancet Countdown report appendix,1 however the IEA definition of
investment has changed, as described below. The data on investment in new
coal-fired electricity generation capacity is sourced from the annual IEA
World Energy Investment publication.120
The revised approach from IEA considers `ongoing' capital spending, with
investment in a new plant spread evenly from the year new construction
begins, to the year it becomes operational. Previously, data were presented
as `overnight' investment, in which all capital spending on a new plant is
assigned to the year in which the plant became operational.
IEA World Energy Investment publication.120
Due to updated methodology, values presented here differ from those
presented in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report.1 A comparison of
investment in new coal-fired electricity generation capacity using the new
methodology compared with the old methodology is presented in the main
report.

4.3.2: Investments in zero-carbon energy and energy efficiency
The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the 2018
Lancet Countdown report appendix,1 however the IEA definition of investment has
changed, as described below. The data for this indicator is sourced from the annual
IEA World Energy Investment publication.120 Four categories of investment are
defined:
*
*
*
*

Renewables & Nuclear - investment in all renewable and nuclear
electricity generation, and renewable transport and heating (including
biofuels and solar thermal heating)
Energy Efficiency - See below
Electricity Networks - investment in electricity transmission and
distribution infrastructure, and battery storage
Fossil Fuels - including oil, gas and coal, upstream mining, drilling and
pipeline infrastructure, and coal, gas and oil power and other fossil fuelbased energy generation capacity.

For most sectors, `investment' is defined as ongoing capital spending on assets. For
some sectors, such as power generation, this investment is spread out evenly from
the year in which a new plant or upgrade of an existing one begins its construction
to the year in which it becomes operational. For other sources, such as upstream
oil and gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, investment reflects the capital
spending incurred over time as production from a new source ramps up or to
maintain output from an existing asset. This definition applies to (updated) 2017
and 2018 data, and differs from the definition previously employed by the IEA, in
which investment was defined as overnight capital expenditure.
For energy efficiency, `investment' is defined as incremental spending by
companies, governments and individuals to acquire equipment that consumes less
energy than that which they would otherwise have bought. This definition remains
unchanged.
Other areas of expenditure, including operation and maintenance, research and
development, financing costs, mergers and acquisitions or public markets
transactions, are not included. Investment estimates are derived from IEA data for
energy demand, supply and trade, and estimates of unit capacity costs, For more
information, see IEA (2019).120

4.3.3. Employment in renewable and fossil fuel energy industries
The data for this indicator is sourced from IRENA121 (renewables) and
IBISWorld122,123 (fossil fuel extraction). Renewable industries included are:
* Large hydropower;
* Solar heating/cooling;
* Solar photovoltaic;
* Wind energy;
* Bioenergy;
* Other technologies.
Bioenergy includes liquid biofuels, soil biomass and biogas. `Other
technologies' includes geothermal energy, ground-based heat pumps,
concentrated solar power, municipal and industrial waste, and ocean energy.
Fossil fuel extraction values include direct employment, whereas renewable
energy jobs include direct and indirect employment (e.g. equipment
manufacturing), except for large hydropower (direct employment only).

Data

Due to an improvement in data collection and estimation methodology,
employment values reported for fossil fuel extraction are in some years
substantially higher than those reported in the 2018 Lancet Countdown
report.1 Similarly, an improvement to the methodology for estimating
hydropower has altered historic values for Hydropower (previously called
`large' hydropower), and Other Technologies (which previously included small
hydropower). For the 2018 data, `Other Technologies' now also includes
employment related to ground-based heat pumps.

4.3.4: Funds divested from fossil fuels
The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the
2018 Lancet Countdown report appendix.1 The data for this indicator is
collected and provided by 350.org.124 It represents the total assets (or assets
under management, AUM) for institutions that have publicly committed to
divest in 2017 (for which data is available), with non-US$ values converted
using the market exchange rate when the commitment was made, and thus
do not directly represent the actual sums divested from fossil fuel companies.
A company is committed to `divestment' if it falls into any of the following
five categories:
*

`Fossil Free' - An institution or corporation that does not have any
investments (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual funds
containing shares, corporate bonds) in fossil fuel companies (coal, oil,
natural gas) and committed to avoid any fossil fuel investments in the
future;

*

`Full' - An institution or corporation that made a binding commitment
to divest (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual funds
containing shares, corporate bonds) from any fossil fuel company
(coal, oil, natural gas);

*

`Partial' - An institution or corporation that made a binding
commitment to divest across asset classes from some fossil fuel
companies (coal, oil, natural gas), or to divest from all fossil fuel
companies (coal, oil, natural gas), but only in specific asset
classes (e.g. direct investments, domestic equity);

*

`Coal and Tar Sands' - An institution or corporation that made a
binding commitment to divest (direct ownership, shares, commingled
mutual funds containing shares, corporate bonds) from any coal and
tar sands companies;

*

`Coal only' - An institution or corporation that made a binding
commitment to divest (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual
funds containing shares, corporate bonds) from any coal companies.

Seven organisations that were originally recorded as non-healthcare
institutions have been considered as such for the purpose of this indicator
96

(London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, The Royal College of
General Practitioners, New Zealand Nurses Organisation, HESTA, HCF,
Berliner Arzteversorgung and Doctors for the Environment Australia). In
addition, the Health Alliance on Climate Change has been removed from the
data (as no explicit divestment commitment has been made). Divestment
commitments by the American Medical Association, which divested in 2018,
was not included in the data provided by 350.org, and was added separately.

4.4: Pricing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels
4.4.1: Fossil fuel subsidies
The data on fossil fuel consumption subsidies for this indicator is taken from the
IEA,125 and is calculated using the price-gap approach, for 42 mostly non-OECD
countries (see data below). The `price-gap' approach is the most commonly
applied methodology for quantifying consumption subsidies. It compares
average end-user prices paid by consumers with reference prices that
correspond to the full cost of supply. The price gap is the amount by which an
end-use price falls short of the reference price and its existence indicates the
presence of a subsidy. Prices are presented in US$2018. Original data and a
further description of the calculation methodology can be obtained from the IEA
(2019).125
Data for historic years have altered compared to the 2018 Lancet Countdown
report1 due to improved information (including availability of data for 2008 and
2017).

Caveats
Future Form
of Indicator

Additional
Information

IEA Energy Subsidies.125
Fossil fuel production subsidies and consumption subsidies for most OECD
countries are not included, due to the lack of consistent data.
An ideal future form of this indicator would have two key elements. The first
element would be the consistent inclusion of production and consumption
subsidies for all countries, available on an annual basis. The second element
would be the use of this data, along with that of carbon pricing data (see
Indicator 4.4.2), to create a `net carbon price' indicator. The future practicality of
this indicator will depend on the availability of data at the appropriate level of
granularity.

4: Economics and finance
4.4: Pricing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels
4.4.2: Coverage and strength of carbon pricing
The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the 2018 Lancet
Countdown report appendix.1 The World Bank provides the data for this indicator,
through the interactive Carbon Pricing Dashboard.126 Prices are those as of 1st August
2016, 1st December 2017, and 1st April 2018, and 1st April 2019, respectively. For 2019,
the indicator includes only instruments that had been introduced by 1st April 2019.
Baseline-and-credit systems are excluded from the analysis. GHG coverage data is
presented as a proportion of 2012 global anthropogenic GHG emissions (53, 937
MTCO2e) as calculated by EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric
Research).127 Monetary values are presented in US$, in current prices. Here data is
presented for 2018 and 2019. See the 2018 Lancet Countdown report for 2017 data.1

Additional
Information

World Bank Carbon Pricing Dashboard.126
Instrument coverage of GHG emissions, in both absolute and proportional term, are
based on total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2012 - the last year in which
consistent data was available. `Baseline and Credit' instruments are not included due
to a lack of price data. Some instruments experience an overlap in coverage. For
example, the UK Carbon Price Floor applies to the power sector in the UK, which is also
subject to carbon pricing under the EU ETS. Other instruments experience partial
overlap. As such, total emissions coverage is likely to be overestimated (ceteris
paribus), although this effect is likely to be minor (<2.5% total coverage). The price
used to calculate the weighted average prices are the prevailing prices on a single day.
The prices for many instruments (particularly ETS instruments) are likely to alter over
the course of a year, however the effect on the final summary values is likely to be
minor. Prices are presented in current values.
As with Indicator 4.4.1, an ideal future form of this indicator would have two key
elements. The first element would be the consistent inclusion of production and
consumption subsidies for all countries, available on an annual basis. The second
element would be the use of this data, along with that of carbon pricing data (see
Indicator 4.4.2), to create a `net carbon price' indicator. The future practicality of this
indicator will depend on the availability of data at the appropriate level of granularity.

4: Economics and finance
4.4: Pricing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels
4.4.3: Use of carbon pricing revenues
The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the 2018 Lancet
Countdown report appendix.1 Data on revenue generated is provided by the World
Bank's interactive `Carbon Pricing Dashboard'.126

104

The method of revenue expenditure classification is adapted from Carl and Fedor
(2016).128 Definitions and assumptions regarding the categories as applied in this
paper are as follows:
*

*
*

*

Climate Change Mitigation - revenues are explicitly allocated to activities or
infrastructure that seeks to reduce, or enable the reduction, of greenhouse
gas emissions, from any source, within or outside of the sectors or
jurisdiction in which the carbon price is applied;
Climate Change Adaptation - as above, but for adaptation activities or
infrastructure;
Revenue Recycling - revenues are explicitly returned to some broad portion
of the population through individual or business tax rate cuts, tax
eliminations, or rebates in order to achieve broad revenue neutrality.
Revenue returned to directly compensate for the cost of GHG emissions
(through free permit allocation or targeted assistance for energy-intensive,
trade-exposed firms) are not included);
General Funds - revenues are explicitly used for purposes other than those
described above, or the use of revenues is unspecified or information is
unavailable.

Only revenue that may be considered government income is included. For example,
revenue generated by sale of permits issued to utilities under the Californian cap and
trade instrument, which much then be used to finance discounts on household
energy bills through `carbon credits', are not considered, as this revenue does not
pass through the State government. Instruments for which price data is not available,
either due to the type of instrument or simply lack of data, are not included.
Other assumptions as applied to individual instruments are noted in the table below.

5: Public and Political Engagement
5.1: Media engagement in health and climate change
5.1.1: Trends in global media coverage of health and climate change
Intersecting trends in coverage of climate change and health were identified in 62
selected newspaper sources from January 2007 through December 2018. The 62
sources are located 36 countries spanning six World Health Organization (WHO)
regions around the world: African Region, Region of the Americas, South-East Asia
Region, European Region, Eastern Mediterranean Region, and Western Pacific
Region. These sources were monitored through Nexis Uni, Proquest and Factiva
databases accessed via the University of Colorado libraries. The searches were
conducted with the following key words in English, Spanish, Portuguese and
German respectively:

Updated verification checks were performed to improve the search signal, by
analysing whether the search string should be modified (without significantly
jeopardising internal validity) in order to reduce `false positives' (it was noted that
in the 2017 and 2018 Lancet Countdown reports,1,131 returns were found to not
centrally address climate change and health together). After considerable
deliberation and discussion, for the 2019 report the full search set was recoded
for 2017-2018, removing the search term `temperature'. This improvement was
made because it was through comparative analyses that this term often generated
an additional hit, but articles were addressing a fever related to some illness,
rather than climate change or global warming. Additional false positives were also
identified through verification checks, comparing search functions across the
databases. It was found that different databases ran the same search string
differently. Therefore, search string grammar was revised such that all databases
would use the same criteria with which to perform the search and return articles.
This eliminated a significant portion of articles which did not address or mention
health and climate change together.
Additional verification checks were also performed to generate adjustment factors
and to attempt to gain some insight into the rates and types of false positives
remaining in the data. Due to the size and scope of the dataset, a full manual
search is not possible. Therefore, these checks were performed by taking a
systematic random sample of articles from each year, from a selection of
newspapers within each region. The adjustment factors were generated to take
into account the rates of complete mis-identification of articles based on the
sample analysed; for example, a common mis-hit is where an article discusses
growing plants in a `greenhouse' and also discusses plant `diseases.' The
adjustments factors were then applied at the WHO regional level. Analysis found
different rates of these types of mis-hits for each region as follows: Africa 19%,
Americas 31%, Southeast Asia 28%, Europe 39%, Eastern Mediterranean 14%,
Western Pacific 43%. These rates are preliminary and future work will include
continuing to revise and refine these adjustment factors.

Data

Caveats

Due to the use of these adjustment factors and the revised search methods, the
2019 Lancet Countdown report provides a more robust assessment of climate
change/global warming and public health indicators.
This indicator uses data from 62 sources in 36 countries around the world over 12
years, from January 2007 through December 2018, collected and cured by the
Media and Climate Chane Observatory (MeCCO) of the University of Colorado.
As noted above, the MeCCO team improved the search and generated adjustment
factors in order to reduce noise in search returns. This has reduced the chances of
incorrectly identifying conjoint references to health and climate change in
newspaper articles. This has confronted caveats articulated in previous reports1,131

108

and has strengthened this monitoring validity in the 2019 Lancet Countdown
report.
Nonetheless, by continuing to monitor newspapers around the world (rather than,
for example, television or radio) the explanatory power across all `media
coverage' remains limited.
There also remain concerns with the degree to which the databases return hits of
duplicate articles which are not warranted (i.e. are not actually the same article
reproduced elsewhere but rather are simply two entries in the database for a
single article) and with the degree to which the articles are engaging with health
and climate change as integrated issues of concern. The analysis examining false
positives revealed high variability in the occurrence of duplicate articles across
time and newspapers and as such was not included in the adjustment factors.

Future Form
of Indicator
Additional
information

The analysis also indicated that a significant portion of articles, anywhere between
40-60% across regions, may mention both climate change and health but do not
deeply engage with them as integrated issues. However, tracking this coverage
remains informative because it gives an idea of how comparable the issues are on
the public agenda and in public awareness; as such, and due to the very high
variability across newspapers, it is not included in the adjustment factors.
Possible further expansion into television and radio, pending data availability. The
precision of this indicator will continue to be improved.
Coverage of climate change and public health tracks relatively consistently with
several trends in media coverage of climate change or global warming more
generally, where political, scientific, cultural, ecological and meteorological
themes provide news hooks for stories over time (Figure 44).
Coverage of total articles has gone up 39% overall across all regions from 20152018 compared to 2011-2014. With some monthly upticks associated with the
particularly high-profile United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) Conferences of Parties (COPs), climate change negotiations in 2009 and
2015, this data indicate a gradual trend toward more sustained attention to
climate change and public health in the public arena over time.

2. The articles in the Database of People's Daily (http://data.people.com.cn/)
were searched from January, 2008 to December, 2018, which contained
any of the key words in the column of "Climate Change" in Table 23. The
distribution of articles with the key words in different years is shown in
Figure 45.

key words from topic Climate Change.
People's Daily
3. The selected articles were processed from step 2 for the filtration in step
4. This step is based on a natural language processing (NLP) method to
transform the articles into the format that is ready to input into the
model. The two main NLP methods used in this step is Word
Segmentation and Removing stop words. In this step, it regulated the
format of Chinese words to reduce recognition ambiguity resulting from
this format.
4. Filtration was performed to identify the real topic of each article
preprocessed in step 3. The real topic was represented by the proportion
of each topic in the individual article. Technically, a classic algorithm in
NLP, called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used in this process. LDA
is an algorithm to extract the topic of articles. In the LDA algorithm, the
number of topics that extracted can be set by the operator.143 Each topic
is composed by the key words, such as, the key words in Table 23 for the
topic of "Climate Change". The number of topics was set as 15, including
111

"Climate Change", "Health", and "other" (13). The other 13 were
extracted from the articles from the model as the result of the highest
frequency topics. The number of articles identified as containing the real
topic "Climate Change" is shown as blue line in Figure 45. Since the
composition of each article is represented by the probability of the
corresponding topics, a probability threshold was set. If the topic, which is
Climate Change or Health, in an article is larger than the threshold, the
article was classified as containing the topic. After the filtration, the
articles classified as containing both topics became the articles that
contain both "Health" and "Climate Change," individually at a probability
greater than 0.5% .Therefore, this step filtered out the non-relevant or
low-relevance articles with respect to "Climate Change" and both
"Health" and "Climate Change". The number of articles focusing on
climate change after step 4 between 2008 and 2018 is shown as the
dotted blue line in Figure 46.
5. The articles were further filtered based on their relevance of both
"Climate change" and "Health", since containing "Climate Change" and
"Health" separately is different to covering the topic "Health and Climate
Change". To start the filtration, the key words in the articles were labelled
with number "1"to represent the "Climate Change" key words and
number "2" to represent the "Health" key words. For every word labelled
"1", the nearest key word labelled "2" was found. Then, the distance
between labelled words was counted. If the distance between the word
labelled "1" and the nearest word labelled "2" was less than or equal to
threshold 50, it was marked as focusing on Health and Climate Change in
this step. In Chinese sentences, the distance of 50 is about 3 to 4
sentences. So, if the gap between two topic words is more that 3-4
sentences, the two topic words were considered as non-related. The
number of articles focusing on both Health and Climate Change between
2008 and 2018 is shown as the black line in Figure 46: Number of articles
reporting of climate change (dotted blue line) and number of articles
reporting of both health and climate change after the relevance check in
People's Daily (black line)..

screening confirmed that the topic was "Health and Climate Change", it
was retained. The red line in Figure 47 shows the selected articles after

Data
Additional
information

All the articles from 2008 to the present published on People's Daily (from the
official website of People's Daily).144
Across the period 2008-18, 74 articles in total were identified as "Health and
Climate Change" related, which was one-third of the articles filtered. This manual
screening stage removed mainly four types of articles identified through the first
five steps:
1. The key word from the topic of "Health" might refer to the health of
animals and the health of the environment; for example, the topic of the
article is climate change and ecosystem health rather than climate change
and human health. 23 articles were excluded for this reason.
2. The article lists some facts, such as a recent increase in the prevalence of
a certain disease. But the reason why is uncertain, climate
change/environmental change is one of the conjectures. 16 articles were
excluded for this reason.
3. The key word "Climate Change" refers to short-term weather or
temperature variation, but not the long-term trends of global climate
change. 23 articles were excluded for this reason.
4. The article has mentioned human health change and climate change in
one or two sentences, but the topic of the article is of low relevance to
the combined topic of "Health and Climate Change". 46 articles were
excluded for this reason
5. The article includes the key words and meets the other selection criteria,
but the combined topic of health and climate is not addressed. 12 articles
were excluded for this reason
Note: the figure in the 2019 Lancet Countdown report includes categories 2-4.
This is for reasons of comparability with other analyses where there was a less
extensive process of manual screening.
It was also noted in Figure 47 that the number of articles on Climate Change was
highest in 2010 and also comparatively higher in 2016, both having a time lag
behind the important COPs in 2009 and 2015. This time lag is attributed to the
tendency in the People's Daily to report climate change and to discuss the
conference outcomes after the important COPs were held (which are usually held
in December).

5: Public and Political Engagement
5.1: Media engagement in health and climate change
5.1.3: Content of coverage in US and Indian newspapers
This new indicator extends the capacity to track media engagement by
focusing on the content of media coverage of health and climate change,
enabling further understanding about what is being reported, as well as the
levels of coverage.
Media sources and timeframe
This indicator focuses on the elite media in two countries, representing very
different contexts. Two newspapers from India and two from the US were
117

selected; Hindustan Times (HT), Times of India (TOI), Washington Post (WP),
and New York Times (NYT).
The focus of analysis was narrowed for articles to two time periods during
2018. First, the time period July to September (inclusive) for both the Indian
and US sources was considered. This time period was used as it covers a
period of extreme weather events in both regions; wildfires in the US and
monsoon flooding in India. This enabled consideration of media reporting in
light of these events, and the ways in which links may be made through
them to climate change and health. Second, reporting during November to
December 2018 was considered. This time period covers the lead up to and
hosting of the COPs. In addition, this covers the time period during which
findings from the Lancet Countdown report itself have been reported in the
media.
Search terms
Media articles were obtained in conjunction with Indicator 5.1.1 (trends in
media coverage). Search terms developed by this team of researchers,
designed to return articles at the intersection of health and climate change
were used. For identification of articles in the Indian media (HT and TOI), the
Factiva database was used. For identification of articles in the US media (WP
and NYT), the Nexis database was used.
Articles in which appeared a minimum of one key search term from both (a)
health, and (b) climate change were identified Error! Reference source not
found..

Pre-screening of articles
The articles across the five months and four media sources were prescreened in order to ensure that only those making meaningful connections
between health and climate change were retained for further analysis.
The procedure used to select articles was as follows:
a. An article must make a meaningful connection between health and
climate change. This can be made explicitly, or implied through the
narrative used, but health topics and climate change aspects must
be clearly linked to be included.
b. Articles were retained when any reference is made to health and
climate change that meets criterion (a). This may include long
articles where only passing reference is made to the link, as well as
articles where the focus is more substantial.
c. Where reference to air pollution is made, it was not deemed to
meet the criterion (a) unless an explicit or implicit link was made to
health. For example, an article that covers the need for coal-fired
plants to close in order to meet climate change targets and reduce
air pollution, was not retained unless a link was also made to the
health impacts of either air pollution or climate change. It was not
enough simply to reference air pollution in the context of climate
change for this to be deemed reference to `health'. Some articles
coded (c) have been included as borderline cases.
In order to carry out pre-screening in a systematic manner, the following
approach was adopted:
*

*

Coder 1 (Paul Haggar) read all articles within the target months, that
were returned by the search string. Where an article was deemed to
be a definite false positive (no meaningful link between health and
climate change), this was noted. Where an article was
questionable/borderline, this was separately noted, with brief
comment provided as to why this was the case.
Coder 2 (Stuart Capstick) subsequently reviewed the article content
of all false positive articles coded as such by Coder 1, to ensure no
articles had been incorrectly coded. Coder 2 also read through all

119

*

questionable/borderline articles coded by Coder 1, to give a second
opinion as to whether these should be included.
Duplicate articles were identified and excluded by both coders, in
order to avoid double-counting of media reporting.

Having pre-screened the articles, a dataset of 248 articles was retained
across the four media sources.
Development of coding framework
In order to identify recurrent and discrete themes within media reporting, a
version of `template analysis'145 was used,which allows for both deductive
coding (a priori themes of interest to be specified in advance) and inductive
coding (themes are incorporated based on prevalent or recurrent topics
detected in the data).
So as to align the thematic coding to the wider Lancet Countdown report, a
priori codes were derived from pre-existing indicators. Themes from
Working Group 1 and Working Group 2 were particularly drawn upon. An
iterative process was used to refine the coding framework, whereby samples
of articles were test-coded, with the suitability of thematic categories
repeatedly revisited until both coders were satisfied that these provided a
fair representation of the themes evident across the media articles.
Both coders independently coded all articles, allowing for multiple codes to
be assigned where appropriate (for example, where an article referred both
to health impacts and co-benefits). Instances where discrepancies arose
were reconciled through agreement between the two coders.
The final framework incorporated the following codes/themes:
*

Health impacts of climate change; specifically:
* Generic/ non-specific health impacts
* Heatwaves and temperature increase
* Precipitation extremes
* Wildfires
* Disease
* Food security/ malnutrition
* Population displacement
* Mental health
* Other impacts
* Co-benefits and co-hazards; specifically:
* Generic/ non-specific co-benefits
* Air pollution (transport)
* Air pollution (energy)
* Air pollution (non-specific or generic)
* Food/ diet
* Other co-benefits and co-hazards
* Adaptation; specifically:
* Generic adaptation

climate change are being reported in the target news sources and time
points. The selected newspapers cannot be taken to be representative of
reporting across the two countries (US and India) or the WHO regions in
which they are located, given that different media sources are known to
have widely diverging positions on climate change.
The coding framework used is intended to identify themes in reporting at
the intersection of health and climate change; it is not intended to provide
insights into the more general ways in which climate change and/or health is
reported in news media.

Future Form of
Indicator

Additional
Information

Because the content analysis used search terms provided by the global
media tracker developed by the MeCCO team for its analysis of trends in
newspaper coverage, the articles returned are necessarily those in which
there was found to be a conjunction of a pre-selected health term and
climate change term. The exact search terms used are likely to have
influenced the types of articles obtained. For example, the bank of returned
articles available to the content analysis was already set up in such a way
that an air pollution and climate change co-occurrence was present in many
places.
Analyses of the content of coverage will form part of the Working Group's
future programme of work. The analysis for the 2019 Lancet Countdown
report will therefore enable the indicator to be refined (e.g. its thematic
structure) and extended (e.g. to other countries and newspapers) for future
Lancet Countdown reports.

Working
Group
Indicator
Methods

5: Public and Political Engagement
5.2: Individual engagement in health and climate change
This new indicator provides an individual-level indicator of public engagement. It
tracks engagement with climate change and health through people's usage of the
online encyclopaedia, Wikipedia. Over the years, Wikipedia has grown to be a
major and trusted source of information that has outpaced traditional
encyclopaedias in terms of reach, coverage, and comprehensiveness.146 It is
regularly listed among the ten most-visited websites worldwide.147 The English
edition covers more than five million articles and over 130,000 active editors.
People around the world use it to engage in topics they are interested in.
Fortunately, the traffic that goes to Wikipedia - and even that which goes to
individual articles of the encyclopaedia - can be analysed over time because the
Wikimedia foundation makes these statistics available to everyone for free. This
makes it a global indicator of what people pay attention to on a daily basis.
The indicator
To investigate to what extent people do not only pay attention to climate change
and human health in isolation, but also to the connection between both, this
indicator draws on clickstream statistics from the English Wikipedia.
Clickstream refers to a dataset provided by the Wikimedia foundation.148 It reports
"streams of clicks", or in other words, how people get to a Wikipedia article, and
127

what links they click on. This is reported on a monthly basis and in pairs of
resources, the first being where the visit came from, the second which page was
visited. For instance, in the data for 2018, people who visited the page on Global
warming followed the link to the article on Climate change 17,791 times. This gives
an indicator of monthly-level global attention towards one issue (if both articles
are representative of the same issue) or two issues (if articles come from different
domains, such as climate change and health). By looking at climate change -
health articles pairs, an indicator of attention towards climate change
consequences for human health over time is generated.
Measurement strategy
The approach to using clickstream data as an indicator of public engagement in
climate change and health is based on the following premises: (1) The Wikipedia
platform is a globally used source for information on a multitude of topics;149 (2)
Citizens use the platform to inform themselves about topics they are interested in;
(3) By tracking engagement with Wikipedia, articles that are related to climate
change as wells as with articles on health, it is possible to identify public
engagement with the relationship between both topics.
The following behavioural patterns are relevant for the validity of the measure as a
proxy for public engagement with climate change and health:
(a) A person is generally interested in the nexus between climate change and
public health and informs her/himself about the topic online by, e.g.,
reading the Wikipedia article on Effects of global warming on human
health.150
(b) A person is interested in climate change and the consumption of
information about the topic then sparks interest in its consequences for
human health. For instance, the person reads the article on Global
warming151 and then turns to the article on Malnutrition.152)
(c) A person is interested in a certain aspect of human health or
consequences of climate change with an immediate impact on human
health, and then turns its attention to climate change issues. For instance,
the person reads the article on Malaria153 () and then turns to the article
on Global warming.151
Indicator construction
In order to use the Wikipedia viewership statistics as a proxy for public
engagement with climate change and health, it is key to select articles that are
representative of these topics. To generate the populations of articles related to
climate change on the one hand and health on the other, a semi-automated
approach was implemented. Based on an initial set of keywords,1 related articles
were searched for, using the internal Wikipedia search.

For climate change articles, the keywords were climate change, warming, ipcc, and green house, and
greenhouse. For health articles, the seed keywords were epidemy, disease, malaria, diarrhoea, infection,
sars, measles, pneumonia, epidemic, pandemic, public health, health care, healthcare, epidemiology,
mortality, morbidity, nutrition, illness, infectious, ncd, non-communicable disease, noncommunicable
disease, communicable disease, air pollution, nutrition, malnutrition, mental disorder, and stunting.
1

128

For each search using one of the keywords, the first 100 results that led to an
article with a minimum word count of 300 were then extracted and identified,
ensuring that the articles that were chosen as seed articles had been given a
certain degree of attention by Wikipedia editors, therefore being more likely to
link to other relevant articles.
Next, the articles collected were screened via the Wikipedia search for categories,
which were used on the Wikipedia to categorise pages in a meaningful way (e.g.,
using categories such as Climate change or Effects of global warming). Those
categories were then themselves screened for relevant articles. All additional
articles were once more filtered such that those with a title matching one of the
initial keywords were chosen. For the health-related articles, several articles that
turned out to be irrelevant for purposes of the indicator were excluded manually.
Health topics are covered extensively on the Wikipedia, articles and topics that, in
principle, could be related to climate change were prioritised. In addition, the
variety of links to further health-related articles on the effects of global warming
Wikipedia page150 were exploited. This list can be viewed as a curated list of
relevant health articles. All in all, 237 articles related to climate change and 825
articles related to health were identified as being representative for either of the
issues. The complete list of articles is listed below.
For the clickstream analysis, the set of articles was extended by also taking
"second-level pages" into account, that is pages that are linked to in the set of 237
climate change or 825 health articles and that are also somewhat related to
climate change or health. Sometimes, people might not directly jump from one of
the major articles on climate change to another one on health, but travel through
an intermediary page (e.g., a possible individual stream of clicks could be: Climate
change  Human impact on the environment  Respiratory disease). The
clickstream data only allowed identification of click volume for pairs of articles, but
by extending the network, clickstreams involving relevant pages that are linked in
the original set of articles could also be captured. After taking these additional
articles into account, 1040 articles related to climate change and 2865 articles
related to health were identified.
Data

This indicator draws on publicly available data from the Wikimedia foundation.
Data from all platforms, i.e. accesses to the Wikipedia via desktop machines,
mobile browsers, and mobile apps was considered.
The clickstream data were downloaded from the Wikimedia Dumps.154 Spider
traffic (i.e. traffic generated by automated bots crawling the platform) was
excluded. Referer-resource pairs (i.e. the pairs of the article of origin and the
target article) that had less than 10 clicks were removed in the original dataset, the
actual clickstream traffic is likely to be underreported. However, this is not
expected to add any systematic bias, in particular since the focus of the indicator is
mainly in changes of engagement over time.
Clickstream data is available from November 2017 onwards. This indicator
exclusively focuses on data from 2018 in the 2019 Lancet Countdown report. The
analyses are limited to the English Wikipedia.
The benefits of the Wikipedia usage metadata for the purpose of tracking public
engagement in climate change and health are that this data: (a) is globally
129

available, (b) covers the time period of interest, (c) is collectible at virtually no
cost, and, most importantly, (d) has high face validity to measure engagement in
this very specific topic. Reading articles on Wikipedia is motivated by attention
towards a particular issue. Individuals invest time to inform themselves about a
topic, which is one manifestation of engagement. Aggregate reading behaviour can
therefore be seen as an a priori valid approximation of public issue engagement.
Caveats

All clickstream information is only available at the aggregate level. It is not possible
to link the data to information about individuals who visited the platform. Also,
the data is not geo-referenced, so it is not possible to infer where page visits came
from. Although the English Wikipedia is predominantly used in English-speaking
countries (according to the Wikimedia Traffic Analysis Report,155 about 40% of the
traffic on the English Wikipedia comes from the US), it is a globally popular
resource. It makes up for 50% of the global traffic to all Wikipedia language
editions. Therefore, it can be seen as a global indicator of public attention that is
somewhat biased towards attention from countries such as the United States,
United Kingdom, India, Canada, and Australia. Extending the analyses to other
language editions will help to remedy this bias and uncover potential geographic
engagement heterogeneity in the future.
More generally, the measure represents an online proxy for an offline
phenomenon. In addition, it is sensitive towards the selection of articles used to
capture engagement. The global popularity of the platform, which consistently
ranks among the ten most visited websites worldwide, speaks in favour of its
usefulness for this application. However, more direct indicators of public
engagement, such as survey-based measures, might provide a useful supplement
and source for validation in the future.
While the data is available for free, access to future data depends on the
Wikimedia API. There is no indication of Wikimedia restricting access in the future.
Instead, Wikimedia has invested in data quality and making access more robust
and convenient.

Future Form
of Indicator

In future reports, this indicator will have increased precision, scope, and value.
First, the number of articles used will be increased. With an ever-growing
Wikipedia, more relevant articles might become available This requires a joint
automated and human classification effort to ensure that the coverage of relevant
articles (true positives) is as large as possible and the number of irrelevant articles
(false positives) in the sample minimal.
Second, the data collection and analysis efforts will be extended to other language
editions (both for the pageviews and the clickstream data). This would make it
possible to track more fine-grained trends at the regional level. It is likely that
there is heterogeneity in public engagement in climate change and health, as
different regions of the world are currently affected by health consequences of
climate change to varying degrees. Studying engagement in different language
versions of the Wikipedia could at least partly pick up this heterogeneity.
Third, the analyses with related event data will be enriched. It is plausible to
assume and could already be partly shown that public engagement is sensitive
towards events, such as extreme weather events or epidemics, but also political

130

and scientific activity such as the COPs or the publication of IPCC reports and
protests such as the School Strikes for Climate.
Fourth, complementary data to track and validate public attention, such as survey,
experimental, and other online data will be explored.
Beyond the 2019 Lancet Countdown report, analyses of individual-level
engagement will be undertaken, using pageview data from Wikimedia. In time,
this indicator may draw on both clickstream and pageview data.

5. Public and Political Engagement
5.3 Engagement in health and climate change in the United Nations General
Assembly
In order to produce the measure of high level political engagement with climate
change and health in the UN General Assembly, a new dataset of UN General
Debate (UNGD) statements is used, which is discussed below. The approach to
using UNGD statements to produce the indicators is based on the application of
natural language processing to the corpus of UNGD statements. References to key
search terms linked to (a) health, and (b) climate change are identified.

In order to produce an indicator of engagement with the intersection of climate
change and health, this indicator focused on whether any of the climate change
138

Data

related terms appeared immediately before or after any health terms in the GD
statements. This was based on a search of the 25 words before and after a
reference to a climate change related term. The choice of 25-word window
context corresponds to approximately half a paragraph of text. Given that UNGD
statements are highly structured and methodically developed by governments
over prolonged periods of time, it was assumed that half a paragraph of text
around public health terms captures a sufficiently narrow context. The number of
climate change term references in these contexts were then searched and counted
to produce the measure of engagement with the link between health and climate
change. A robustness analysis was then conducted by varying the size of the
context (5, 10, and 50 words). This substantively produced the same trends over
time. A sample of the references produced by the search were then also further
examined to ensure that the references identified reflect engagement with the
health impacts of climate change.
This indicator draws on a new and updated dataset of GD statements: the United
Nations General Debate corpus, in which the annual GD statements have been preprocessed and prepared for the application of natural language processing to the
official English versions of the statements.156 The dataset contains all of the
country speeches made in the UN General Debate between 1970 and 2018. Table
27 presents summary of the data by year.

The data was pre-processed for analysis by removing punctuation, symbols,
numbers, and URLs. Any tokens smaller than three characters were also removed to
reduce typos and mistakes from the document digitisation process. In addition, all
tokens were normalised (lowercased). All pre-processing and analysis was carried
out in R using "quanteda" package.157
Caveats

The search for climate change terms in the context of public health references is a
proxy for the semantic linkage between the two sets of terms in GD statements. This
approach produces a scalable and reproducible measure with a high degree of
reliability that does not involve human judgement or subjective biases. However,
there may be examples of governments referring to climate change and health but
not the direct linkages between the two, which are included in the count; and there
may be examples of governments discussing the health impacts of climate change
in their UNGD statements, which are not included in our measure because the
distance between the mention of the climate change term and the health term
exceeds 25 words. Based on an analysing a sample of the speeches and references,
such cases are relatively rare and do not have a significant bearing on the indicator
or the trends uncovered.
It is also worth noting that the analysis here is based on a narrow range of search
terms, which excludes reference to many of indirect links between climate change
and health. A number of GD statements in this time period refer to such indirect
connections, such as the effects of climate change on water and agriculture -
however, these are not included here. Therefore, the results present a somewhat
conservative estimate of high level political engagement with the intersection of
climate change and health. Future work in this area will consider engagement with
these indirect links.

Future Form
of Indicator

In the future, this indicator will look more closely at the references to indirect links
between climate change and health. For example, what are the main ways in
which governments view climate change impacting on health? This indicator will
consider whether this changes over time, based on awareness of the multiple ways
in which climate change and health are connected. Some of the references to the
indirect links between climate change and health made in UNGD statements have
been highlighted in the main 2019 Lancet Countdown report.

Additional
Information

Some additional findings and breakdowns are presented here. Figure 56 below
presents the proportion of countries that engage with the intersection of climate
change and health by WHO region. It is worth noting that the relatively higher level
of political engagement by countries in the Western Pacific is especially driven by
the small island development states (SIDS) in this region. It also worth noting that
North America WHO region contains only two countries, USA and Canada. As
neither of these countries refer to the health impacts of climate change (the US
statement made no reference to climate change), the North America region has zero
proportion of countries engaged with the climate change-health links.

In addition to grouping countries by WHO region, different types of countries are
also considered in terms of their potential importance and role in addressing issues
related to climate change. This is provided in Figure 59. As noted in previous Lancet
Countdown reports,1,131 the SIDS have driven much of the engagement with the
health impacts of climate change, as well as climate change more generally, in the
UN General Assembly. As such, a SIDS grouping is included. Arguably the three most
important countries/unions in addressing climate change are USA, China, and the
EU. This is both in terms of their carbon dioxide emissions and their power within
the international system. This group is referred to as Tier 1 countries in Figure 59.
Finally, an additional grouping of countries that are also important in terms of their
CO2 emissions, their influence in international politics, and their potential impact on
addressing climate change are considered. This grouping, which, in this indicator, is
referred to as Tier 2 countries includes: Poland, Australia, South Africa, Brazil, India,
France, Germany, and Indonesia.
Figure 59 shows the proportion of countries that engage with the intersection of
climate change and health based on these country groupings. Figure 60 shows the
total number of references to the climate change-health intersection according to
these groupings. Both figures demonstrate the higher level of engagement with the
climate change-health linkages by SIDS than by Tier 1 or Tier 2 countries.

Figure 61 below shows the level of political engagement with climate change and
health separately, rather than engagement with the intersection of climate change
and health. This is measured by the references to the key search terms associated
with climate change and health in General Debate speeches. Figure 62 shows the
proportion of countries that refer to public health in their GD statements between
144

1970 and 2017, while Figure 63 shows the proportion of countries that make a
reference to climate change during this period. The figures show that in general
there is higher levels of engagement with climate change than health. Figures 64
and 66 also show a sharp increase in engagement with climate change in the General
Debate around 2006, followed by a decline in 2009 after the COP15 in Copenhagen
that year. However, there has been an increase in engagement with climate change
in recent years around the Paris Agreement. Engagement with health has in
comparison been lower. However, there has broadly been increasing engagement
with public health during this time period, and a sharp increase in 2000 with the
launch of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). There is also an increase in
the salience of global health from 2012 onwards, which coincides with the transition
from the MDGs to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Figure 64 below presents a world map, which shows the countries that refer to the
intersection of climate change and health in their 2018 GD statements, and the
number of individual references they make. The map shows the relatively low level
of engagement with the health impacts of climate change around the world in 2018.
However, due to their size the SIDS do not show up on the map. As noted, the SIDS
tend to be highly represented among nations engaging with the health-climate
change links.
Figure 65 and Figure 66 present world maps, which show the countries that refer to
public health and climate change respectively in their 2018 GD statements, as well
as indicating the number of references made by each country. The figures
demonstrate that while there is relatively low engagement with the intersection of
146

health and climate change, there is considerable engagement with the issues of
climate change and health separately.

5. Public and Political Engagement
5.4 Corporate engagement with health and climate change in the healthcare sector
In order to produce the measure of engagement with climate change and health in
healthcare companies' UN Global Compact Communication of Progress (COP)
reports, publicly available COP reports were used. The approach to using the COP

151

reports to produce the indicators is based on identifying references to key search
terms linked to (a) health, and (b) climate change.

In order to produce an indicator of engagement with the intersection of climate
change and health, this indicator focused on whether any of the climate change
related terms appeared immediately before or after any public health terms in the
COP reports. This was based on a search of the 25 words before and after a
reference to a public health related term. Table 29 presents total number of
references identified in COP reports per year, where the column "Intersection" is
the count of climate change terms appearing in the context (25 words before and
after) of health terms.

This indicator draws on the publicly available UN Global Compact COP reports. A total
of 37,102 reports were downloaded from COP from 138 countries across 43
industries. The total number of reports per year for 2011-2018 in are presented in
Table 30 (prior to 2011 there were total of 11 reports).

COP reports are submitted in 31 different languages. For the development of this
indicator only reports available in English (17,896 or 48.23%), were included. A
number of the English language files were corrupt or could not be converted into
plain text format for analysis. The distribution of available English-language reports
over time is presented in Table 31.

Netherlands (452), and Switzerland (427).
There are only single COP report submissions before 2011, the sample of COP reports
was limited to the period 2011-2018. These documents were pre-processed and
153

prepared for the application of natural language processing by converting the reports
to plain text format; removing punctuation and numbers; removing stopwords;
regularising (lowercasing); and stemming. All of the pre-processing was conducted
using the Python NLTK toolkit.

As noted above, only COP reports that were submitted in English were considered.
This includes just under half of all available UN General Compact COP reports.
This analysis here is based on a narrow range of search terms, which excludes
reference to many of indirect links between climate change and health. Reports
may also discuss indirect connections, such as the effect of climate change on
agriculture, however, these are not included here. Therefore, the results present a
somewhat conservative estimate of high corporate engagement with the
intersection of climate change and health. Future work in this area will consider
engagement with these indirect links, as well as providing additional forms of
analysis.
In the future, this indicator will increase the number of reports analysed by
translating our key search terms into several other key languages, and
incorporating reports submitted in languages other than English into this sample.
Translation of key terms into Spanish, Portuguese, and German has already been
implemented in WG5. These translations will be used in next year's report.
Figure 75 presents the proportion of healthcare equipment and services companies
referring to climate change, health, and the intersection in CP reports from 2011 to
2018, with only 12% of companies making reference to both in 2018.

Figure 75: Proportion of healthcare sector companies referring to climate change,
health, and the intersection of health and climate change in CP reports, 2011-2018
Some additional findings and breakdowns are presented in this section. Figure 76
presents the total number of references to climate change, health, and the
intersection of climate change and health across all of the COP reports (and all
sectors). As noted in the main report, there are low and fairly constant levels of
engagement with the climate change-health linkages.

climate change and health across all COP reports, 2011-2018.

Figure 77 presents the total references with the intersection of climate change and
health to better show any trends occurring in engagement. The figure shows that
there while total references may still be quite low, there has been an increase in
engagement with the climate change-health linkages, particularly since 2015.

Figure 77: Total references to the intersection of climate change and health across
all COP reports, 2011-2018.

Figure 78 shows that the total proportion of COP reports that refer to climate change,
health, and the intersection of climate change and health. The report shows that
engagement with climate change and health are generally much higher than with the
intersection. Around 60% of all COP reports refer to climate change in 2018, while
approximately 45% of all reports refer to health in 2018. In contrast only 15% of
reports refer to the intersection of climate change and health in 2018. The figure
shows that there has been a very slight increase in the level of engagement across
all three issues, however, the increase in engagement with the climate change-health
intersection is far less pronounced than when total references are considered.

Engagement with climate change and health in the UN Global Compact COP reports
by WHO region was also considered. Figure 79 shows the total number of references
to the climate change-health intersection based on which of the WHO regions a
company is based on, and Figure 80 shows the proportion of companies based in the
different WHO regions that refer to the health impacts of climate change in their
annual COP report.

Figure 80 shows that the highest proportion of COP reports engaging with the climate
change-health intersection in recent years has come from corporations based in
North America, followed by the Western Pacific region. The lowest engagement
comes from corporations based in the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Engagement across different sectors was also considered. Table 32 shows the total
number of references to climate change, health, and the intersection across the
different sectors, while Table 33 shows the proportion of corporations in each sector
that engage with climate change, health, and the climate change-health intersection.

climate change and health by sector.

Figure 82: Proportion of corporations referring to climate change, health, and the
intersection of climate change and health by sector.

As discussed in the main report, the highest level of engagement with the
intersection of climate change and health can be seen in the alternative energy,
chemicals, electricity, mobile telecommunications, oil and gas producers, and real
estate investment sectors. In contrast, there were much lower levels of engagement
in the healthcare sector.
Additional information on engagement with the climate change-health intersection
in the healthcare sector is presented here. In addition to the total number of
references to, and total proportion of reports that refer to, the climate change and
health, Figure 83 shows the average number of references to climate change, health,
and the intersection in COP reports from healthcare corporations. The figure again
demonstrates the low level of engagement with the health impacts of climate change
in healthcare sector COP reports.

Figure 83: Average references to climate change, health, and the intersection of
climate change and health in the healthcare sector COP reports, 2011-2018.
Figure 84 shows the proportion of healthcare sector corporations that engage with
the climate change-health intersection by WHO region. As discussed in the main
report, the figure shows that healthcare sector corporations based in Europe tend to
engage much more with the climate change-health links than healthcare
corporations based in other regions.

Table 34 and Table 35 display the total number of references to each of the keywords
related to climate change (Table 34) and health (Table 35) in the COP reports of
corporations in the health care sector.

Figure 85 displays a network graph of the co-occurrence of these key terms in COP
reports in the healthcare sector. The figure shows that much of the emphasis is on
the link between `climate change' and `health', as well as on `healthcare'.
