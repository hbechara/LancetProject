Conceived in 2003 and born in 2005 with the launch of its first report and country profiles, the Countdown to 2015 for Maternal, Newborn, and Child Survival has reached its originally proposed lifespan. Major reductions in the deaths of mothers and children have occurred since Countdown's inception, even though most of the 75 priority countries failed to achieve Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5. The coverage of life-saving interventions tracked in Countdown increased steadily over time, but wide inequalities persist between and within countries. Key drivers of coverage such as financing, human resources, commodities, and conducive health policies also showed important, yet insufficient increases. As a multistakeholder initiative of more than 40 academic, international, bilateral, and civil society institutions, Countdown was successful in monitoring progress and raising the visibility of the health of mothers, newborns, and children. Lessons learned from this initiative have direct bearing on monitoring progress during the Sustainable Development Goals era.	1

10 years after the Countdown to 2015 for Maternal, Newborn, and Child Survival (Countdown) was launched, the world has become a healthier place for children and women. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) sparked those involved in the 2003 Lancet Child Survival Series to propose the Countdown initiative, who pledged to hold regular conferences for "ensuring that there is an overall mechanism for improving accountability, re-energising commitment, and recognising accomplishments in child survival".1 In response to this call to action, Countdown launched its first report in 2005,2 which was followed by five others (2008,3 2010,4 2012,5 2013,6 and 20147). The final report is being released this week, on October 19, in Mexico City, Mexico. From its original focus on child survival, Countdown has expanded to track progress on reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health indicators relevant to MDGs 4 (reduce child mortality) and 5 (improve maternal health). The heart of the Countdown reports are the two-page country profiles that summarise the most recent data for intervention coverage, maternal and child mortality, and nutrition. The country profiles also highlight socioeconomic inequalities in intervention coverage, and two of the main drivers of coverage: health systems and policies, and financing. Countdown has evolved in many ways during the past decade. The partnership has grown from 11 to 43 institutional stakeholders, and the number of countries monitored from 60 to 75, comprising more than 95% of global deaths of mothers and children. As the scope shifted beyond child survival, and in response to new evidence, the number of indicators tracked expanded from 35 to 73. By including new, proven interventions in its profiles even before data were available for many countries, Countdown has contributed to the identification of data gaps and had arguably helped to raise the visibility of such new interventions. Countdown recognised the importance of engaging at country level, and from 2012  	1
embarked on a set of case studies aimed at understanding how countries have achieved progress (appendix pp 1-2). Countdown is also the primary source of coverage information for the Commission on Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health and the Independent Expert Review Group8 reports. In the decade since Countdown's inception, the number of reports on specific reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child (RMNCH) health issues has grown rapidly. Countdown's particular niche has been its action-oriented focus on intervention coverage, and the user-friendly synthesis of information in the country profiles. Our principles have not changed over this period:1 to focus on monitoring the coverage of evidencebased, cost-effective interventions; to maintain a country orientation; and to build on existing goals and monitoring efforts. Countdown's commitment to these principles and its products have helped to increase the global visibility of RMNCH, and has plausibly contributed to reversing the slow rate of progress in reducing child, newborn, and maternal mortality in the 1990s that was documented in early public health series in The Lancet.1,9-11 As the MDG era draws to a close, the global public health and development communities must take stock of progress over the past 15 years, and get ready for the	1

The 2015 Countdown Results Data We have previously reported on Countdown's data sources and methods,12,13 and these are described in detail in the panel and the appendix (pp 3-4). In this section, we summarise findings for 2015 with an emphasis on time trends; the full results are available in the 2015 report. Based on modelled estimates, the global maternal mortality ratio has decreased by around 45% over the past two decades, and the number of annual maternal deaths has dropped from around 523 000 to 289 000.16 Although mortality reductions seem to have accelerated--threequarters of Countdown countries reduced maternal mortality faster in 2000-13 than in the 1990s13--very few Countdown countries will achieve MDG 5. A 2009 analysis of maternal deaths worldwide reported that more than half of these were due to haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, and sepsis--causes that are preventable through the provision of quality antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care.17 Recognition of the role of contraception to reduce maternal and newborn deaths has led to a major Panel: Countdown data sources and methods Most coverage, equity, and nutrition data come from standardised population-based surveys (Demographic and Health Surveys [DHS], Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys [MICS], or other nationally representative surveys that meet data quality standards). Mortality data are provided by United Nation's sources. Intervention coverage was monitored for the 75 Countdown countries with data from 2009 to 2015. Coverage trends are derived from countries that had at least two datapoints, one from between 2000 and 2008, and the second from 2009 to 2014. The composite coverage index (CCI) is a weighted average of eight interventions along the continuum of care, all of which have been available in most countries for at least a decade.14,15 Results on socioeconomic inequalities are based on wealth quintiles calculated on the basis of household assets.15 Trends in CCI were estimated with 47 Countdown countries with at least two surveys (either DHS or MICS) where CCI was available, with survey years ranging from 1994 to 2014, using a multilevel model (appendix pp 3-4). Health systems and policy indicators are derived from global databases maintained by the WHO and other UN organisations, and financing data are abstracted from datasets maintained by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Assistance Committee.	1
increase in resources for family planning programmes.18 Evidence of the importance of reaching adolescents with family planning and nutrition programmes for improving birth outcomes, as well as their own health, has also resulted in increased attention to this population group.19,20 The growing recognition of stillbirths as a public health problem--2*6 million annual third trimester stillbirths, with 1*2 million of these occurring in the intrapartum period--led Countdown to report on the stillbirth rate since 2010. Unfortunately, global visibility for stillbirths might remain limited in the SDG era in view of the absence of a specific target.21 The global under-5 mortality rate has dropped by 53% since 1990, from 91 deaths per 1000 livebirths to 43 per 1000 livebirths in 2015.22 And, the global annual rate of reduction has steeply accelerated over time, suggesting that more progress can be expected in the coming years. In 2000, the leading causes of the 10*8 million under-5 deaths were neonatal conditions (33%), diarrhoea (22%), pneumonia (21%), malaria (9%), and AIDS (3%).23 Estimates for 2015 indicate 5*9 million deaths a year22 with a major shift in the causes of death: preterm birth complications cause 18% of all under-5 deaths, and along with other neonatal causes represent 45% of all deaths. Deaths due to pneumonia (16%), diarrhoea (9%), malaria (5%), and AIDS (1%) have declined in relative terms, and even more so in absolute terms.24 The growing concentration of deaths in the newborn period and the improved understanding about causes of newborn deaths has sparked the scale-up of long-existing interventions and the development of new ones. The past 10 years have also seen a growing understanding of the role of nutrition in mortality and human development.25,26 Suboptimal nutrition, including fetal growth restriction, stunting, wasting, and deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc along with suboptimum breastfeeding, is an underlying cause of 45% of all deaths of children younger than 5 years.25 Progress in the Countdown countries in reducing maternal and under-5 mortality since 1990 is summarised in table 1. A third of the 75 countries achieved the annual rate of reduction of 4*4% or higher in under-5 mortality that was needed to reach MDG 4 in 2015, but only six countries have achieved the annual rate of reduction of 5*5% or higher in maternal mortality required by MDG 5. The successful countries are flagged in table 1. Four countries--Cambodia, Eritrea, Nepal, and Rwanda--have achieved both MDGs 4 and 5. Table 1 also shows another measure of progress, based on whether each country has met the mortality thresholds originally set for inclusion as a Countdown country. There are two such thresholds. The first group of 60 countries was selected in 2005 for monitoring by Countdown based on their high levels of under-5 mortality--either an under-5 mortality rate of 90 per 1000 livebirths or greater, or an absolute annual number of deaths of 50 000 or more.  	1
Of note, 2004 is the baseline year during which Countdown assessed countries for monitoring on the basis of U5MR (U5MR 90 or 50 000 deaths). In 2008, eight additional countries were included on the basis of MMR using 2005 data (MMR >550 or MMR >200 and 750 maternal deaths). In 2012, six additional low-income countries were included to reconcile the Countdown and Global Strategy country lists: Comoros, Kyrgyzstan, Sao Tome and Principe, and Solomon Islands. The 2005 report includes the U5MR but not the absolute number of deaths. U5MR=under-5 mortality rate per 1000 livebirths. MMR=maternal mortality rate per 100 000 livebirths. *Average annual rate of reduction of at least 4*4% for U5MR between 1990 and 2015. Average annual rate of reduction of 5*5% or higher for MMR between 1990 and 2013.	1
Among these 60 countries, 28 have now graduated from Countdown by reducing child mortality below this threshold. In 2008, Countdown broadened its scope, by including eight additional countries with maternal mortality ratios of more than 550 per 100 000 livebirths, or a ratio of more than 200 plus an absolute annual number of maternal deaths of more than 750. Of the eight, seven have now graduated by reducing maternal mortality below this threshold. The remaining seven priority countries were added after 2008, to maintain consistency with the priority low-income countries listed in the Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health, and to include South Sudan after it was formed in 2012. 2052	1
Alternative estimates for maternal27 and child28 mortality are available from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. Although their estimates of levels and trends for specific countries might differ from those presented in table 1, the overall conclusions are the same: a small minority of low-income and middle-income countries will reach either MDG 4 or 5. In the next four sections, we summarise recent results from Countdown's four streams of technical work: coverage, equity, health systems and policies, and financing. We also highlight progress in data availability and some of the most important data gaps that remain in each of these areas.  	1

Coverage Figure 1 shows coverage across the continuum of care for selected high-impact interventions, and the service contacts through which these and other interventions can be delivered. The bars show the median coverage reported by all Countdown countries with data available in 2009 or later; the grey dots show the values for individual countries. Coverage levels are particularly low around the time of birth, and for case-management interventions for childhood illnesses. The list of coverage indicators tracked in Countdown has evolved with time. For example, indicators for rotavirus vaccine and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were added in 2014 because of increased data availability following rapid policy adoption by countries. We no longer track the indicator of antibiotic treatment for childhood pneumonia, because validation studies have shown that this cannot be measured accurately in household surveys.29 We have retained the indicator on oral rehydration therapy (oral rehydration salts), increased fluids, and continued feeding) to allow the examination of trends. However, WHO/UNICEF guidelines now recommend oral rehydration salts and zinc, and in the future it will be important to track coverage for both. In 2015, 37 countries had coverage data  	1
for zinc treatment of diarrhoea. The median coverage was 1%, with a high of 28% in Malawi. Results for the full set of Countdown coverage indicators are available in the appendix (pp 5-7) and appendix (pp 8-11) provides information about HIV and caesarean-section indicators. Data availability (figure 1) has improved for all indicators measured through household surveys. For example, the number of countries with information about postnatal care visits for babies increased from five during the period 2000-063 to 35 in 2009-14. The rapid expansion of household surveys in the wake of the MDGs led to real progress in ensuring that all countries have recent, high-quality data to guide their programmes and policies.30,31 Our results continue to show unacceptably low coverage for most of these interventions and service contacts, with enormous ranges among countries around the global median values. Even interventions for the prevention of malaria, which have shown greater accelerations in coverage than any other indicators in recent years,32 are not reaching their life-saving potential. In endemic countries with available data, only 23% of women report receipt of malaria prevention during pregnancy, and only 38% of children younger than 5 years were reported to be sleeping under an	1

insecticide-treated net. Treatment interventions are still reaching fewer than 40% of children with malaria or diarrhoea, and only 54% of children with symptoms of pneumonia are taken outside the home for care. Immunisations continue to be an exception, with median coverage generally greater than 85%, although intercountry variation is still marked. Time trends in intervention coverage were featured in an earlier publication32 and are updated in table 2. Three broad patterns are evident. First, the three malaria interventions that started less than 20% in the earlier period showed substantial increases with time. HIV interventions are not shown in table 2 because baseline data were not available due to changes in the methods, but the prevention of mother-to-child transmissions with antiretrovirals reached 53% in the most recent period with a range of 1% to more than 95% across countries with data. Second, some interventions already showed high coverage around 2000, and increased modestly in 2054	1
absolute terms, partly because there was little scope for increase; these include antenatal care (at least one visit), improved drinking water sources, and the three vaccines. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of the gap was closed for these interventions. The third group includes all other interventions, which had less than 60% coverage up to 2009 and increased by 10% points or less: family planning, four or more antenatal care visits, skilled birth attendance, improved sanitation facilities, exclusive breastfeeding, and all the case-management interventions against diarrhoea and pneumonia. These patterns suggest that rapid coverage increases are possible when interventions are prioritised and generously funded as in the case of the malaria or HIV indicators. On the other hand, very little progress was noted for interventions that require service contacts along the continuum of care and 24/7 service availability, particularly during pregnancy and childbirth, and for the management of childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia. Further improvement is needed urgently in the quantity and quality of data for monitoring coverage. For example, there is no guarantee that women and children who report a service contact actually receive the full complement of interventions that should be delivered during that contact. Reported coverage for antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care therefore represent so-called best case scenarios for actual coverage of interventions that should be provided during those contacts. New Countdown secondary analyses of patterns of antenatal care in seven countries show widely varying patterns of drop-off between the first antenatal care visit and subsequent visits, with women reporting more visits having an increased probability of receiving recommended interventions. Redoubled efforts are needed to ensure that contact with health services results in the delivery of all recommended life-saving interventions. New approaches are also needed to link household surveys and health facility survey data to generate essential data for service quality that are currently lacking (appendix pp 12-13).	1
Equity The equity dimension was noticeably absent from the MDGs.33 Since its first report, Countdown has provided original analyses of inequalities in intervention coverage by wealth, sex of the child, place of residence, and other social determinants. These analyses consistently show systematic pro-rich inequalities for virtually all coverage indicators.34 The gaps are wider for interventions, such as antenatal care (four or more visits) and skilled birth attendance, that require access to fixed health facilities, compared with interventions such as immunisation that can be delivered at community level.34 Our analyses have also shown that countries that made rapid progress in coverage were those that effectively reached the poorest families.35 The growing availability of surveys allows disaggregated analyses of trends in coverage for the poorest and richest  	1
Health systems and policies Supportive policy environments and functional health systems with adequate human resources are prerequisites for high and equitable coverage. The number of policy and systems indicators tracked in Countdown has increased from five in 2005 to 11 in this year's 2015 report, including four measures of systems that are crucial to effective service delivery for women and children. These indicators are consistent with international frameworks.36,37 Although further work is needed to develop comparable metrics for implementation strength at national and subnational levels, Countdown is finalising a set of instruments to describe relevant policies and aspects of RMNCH programme implementation across countries and over time. Notable progress in adoption of supportive policies has occurred across the Countdown countries (appendix p 14 shows adoption rates for ten essential policies based on a 2013-14 WHO survey). Figure 3 shows that the number of countries that adopted each of six policies for which trend data are available increased substantially between 2008 and 2014. However, more progress is needed, particularly for policies that are lagging such as maternity protection in accordance with Convention 183 of the International Labour Organisation (including maternity leave and employment protection during pregnancy and the postnatal period) and the International Code of Marketing for Breastmilk Substitutes. Increased investment in information systems has resulted in an expansion of available data for skilled health professionals.38 Three-quarters of Countdown countries remain below 22*8 physicians, nurses, and midwives per 10 000 population, a threshold WHO considers necessary to achieve relatively high coverage  	1
quintiles of mothers and children, across a large number of countries. Figure 2 shows these results for the composite coverage index (CCI) in 47 Countdown countries with available information from several surveys. Globally, CCI coverage increased for both the richest and poorest quintiles, but the increase was steeper among the poorest (1*0% point per year [95% CI 0*8-1*1]) than for the richest (0*3% point [0*2-0*4]; figure 2A). The rich-poor gap declined from 28% points in 2000 to 19% points by 2014. This finding indicates an increase in coverage equity in both absolute and relative terms (both trends with p<0*0001; figure 2B). Whereas the coverage gap between rich and poor mothers and children persists, inequalities are decreasing, at least for the eight long standing interventions that are part of the CCI. Similar to coverage, data availability for equity analyses has improved, but there is still much scope for progress. Repeated surveys with consistent measurement of equity stratifiers, such as wealth, sex, residence, or ethnic origin, are required to identify priority groups and track subnational progress over time.	1

of essential health interventions.38 The most recent estimates show a median density of skilled health professionals of 10*2 per 10 000 population in the Countdown countries, ranging from 1*6 per 10 000 in Madagascar and Niger to 142 per 10 000 population in Uzbekistan. Countdown has contributed to substantial increases in data availability on policies by helping to shape the contents of the WHO's biannual policy survey. More work is needed to overcome the limitations of the use of a survey-based approach, to ensure more timely and accurate information, and to explore associations between policies and changes in coverage levels. Efforts are under way to assess the feasibility of collection of data for selected tracer indicators of the quality of care (appendix pp 12-13).	1
assistance (ODA) surged after the MDG summit in 2000.40 Although the growth in ODA slowed after the economic crisis in 2007-08, trends from 2003 to 2012 in Countdown countries show a tripling of ODA to maternal, newborn, and child health (from US$2 billion to $6 billion). Most of the investment was for general health care (including health systems support), reproductive health, malaria programmes, and immunisation programmes.40 During this same time period, ODA for projects that mention newborns grew exponentially, from $33 million to $1 billion, reflecting the growing visibility of newborn health, yet far too little in view that neonatal causes represent almost half of under-5 deaths. A comparison of the present estimates with those produced by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, the Partnership for Maternal Newborn and Child Health, and United Nations Population Fund is available in the full Countdown report. Although these funding increases and the spike in high level commitments to RMNCH between 2010 and 2015 are encouraging, more is needed. In particular, better targeting of resources to countries with the greatest need could help to narrow equity gaps and help to achieve the next set of goals. Each of the Countdown case studies include a detailed analysis of trends in financial flows to RMNCH, and show the complexity of the funding environment. The Peru and Ethiopia case studies, for example, both showed rapid recent growth in RMNCH expenditures. Yet the two countries used different resources and financing mechanisms to fund their programmes. Peru, an upper-middle-income country, relied mostly on domestic funding, whereas Ethiopia, a low-income country, relied heavily on external funding. Both countries have high levels of out-of-pocket spending, which must be addressed to make health care more affordable to disadvantaged population groups. What about the future? The general consensus across the panoply of resource tracking efforts is that ODA expenditures for RMNCH are increasing.40,41 For domestic spending there is insufficient data for RMNCH expenditure to estimate trends. The work of the Lancet Global Commission on Investing in Health, which emphasises the centrality of RMNCH to achieve global development, and the World Bank's recently announced Global Financing Facility for RMNCH, are signs that investments in RMNCH will continue to grow.42,43 However, the multiplicity of goals and targets in the SDG framework could detract from a sustained and accelerated focus on RMNCH, leaving many donor-dependent countries short of funds. The most important future strategies could be those that shore-up the contribution of national sources to RMNCH, using mechanisms such as the establishment of concrete accountability procedures that strengthen the collaboration between citizens and governments and build more sustainable and efficient funding for RMNCH at local levels. 2056	1
Monitoring and accountability: how can the Countdown experience inform the SDGs? The MDGs encouraged global political consensus, provided a focus for advocacy and visibility, improved the targeting and flow of aid, and strengthened monitoring of process and outcome indicators.39 Within the context of the health MDGs, Countdown played a unique part as a multistakeholder initiative. Countdown's success in monitoring and accountability at country level for MDGs 4 and 544,45 was complemented by other initiatives, such as the Independent Expert Review Group,8 that relied heavily on our data to push for global level accountability. Our experience has inspired others. For example, advocates for the Non-Communicable Diseases Countdown 2025 wrote: "lessons from Countdown to 2015 include the importance of collaboration and inclusiveness; adaptation of global targets to the national situation; regular measurement; transparent review and publication of progress on priority interventions and outcomes; strong engagement of academia and civil society; regular reports based on fairly simple summaries of country progress; and adequate resources. Countdown to 2015, while retaining a core of basic information, has evolved to include detailed country reports and shows the value of a strong and independent partnership for global health."46 Leaders of global initiatives developed to track physical activity (P C Hallal, personal communication) and nutrition (L Haddad, personal communication) also acknowledge that Countdown has inspired their work. This final Countdown report focuses on time trends in the past 15 years. Intervention coverage increased for most interventions, and particularly for those that received substantial donor investment such as interventions against malaria and HIV.7,13 The gap in coverage between rich and poor seems to be narrowing, at least for interventions that have been available in low-income countries for many years. More countries are adopting RMNCH policies, and financing for the health of mothers, newborns, and children has increased. Each of these statements about general trends, however, must be qualified. Cost-effective interventions are still failing to reach a large proportion of those who need them. Socioeconomic inequities in coverage are still rampant within virtually every Countdown country. Essential policies and sufficient and equitably distributed human resources and commodities are still lacking in most countries. And despite increased funding, there is still a huge shortfall of reliable resources for RMNCH. The post-2015 SDGs are unquestionably much broader and more complex than the MDGs. Their adoption will bring about substantive challenges to monitoring and accountability. To conclude, we address how lessons learned from the Countdown process could be relevant to the SDG era. The MDGs were launched in 2000 with a baseline of 1990, a peculiar choice implying that signatory countries were held accountable for trends during the preceding  	1
10 years. Additionally, the absence of real-time data for births and deaths led to complex modelling procedures to estimate concurrent and past maternal and child mortality. Reliance on these methods meant that historical trends were revised every time new data became available. Baseline values therefore kept changing, and countries seemed to be aiming at moving targets. Fortunately, the SDG starting date is fixed in 2015, but substantial investments in data collection are urgently needed to provide valid and precise baseline levels. Whereas child mortality estimates are based on actual data from censuses, surveys, or civil registration, maternal mortality is modelled for most low-income and middleincome countries on the basis of predictor variables such as gross domestic product per capita, fertility, HIV prevalence, and coverage of skilled birth attendants.16 There are important problems with the acceptability of modelled estimates at country level, yet very few countries have invested in large-scale surveys or registration systems to actually measure maternal mortality.47,48 In summary, monitoring during the MDG era was largely dependent on modelled mortality estimates, coverage measurements derived from infrequent household surveys, and ad-hoc systems for tracking policies, health system measures, and funding flows. Additionally, the MDG framework has been largely criticised for its neglect of equity. If the international community is serious about achieving the SDGs, it must invest now in improvements and innovations in measurement.49 The area of measurement of effective coverage and the quality of preventive and curative interventions deserves special attention. There are other aspects of the SDGs that the Countdown experience suggests are likely to be problematic. For example, MDGs 4 and 5 were clearly defined, with quantitative goals for relative mortality reductions. The corresponding SDGs (3*1 and 3*2) propose absolute targets of 25 per 1000 livebirths at national level for under-5 mortality, 12 per 1000 livebirths for neonatal mortality, and a global maternal mortality ratio of 70 per 100 000 livebirths. According to 2013 estimates, six Countdown countries already have under-5 mortality rates less than 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths, and 11 have maternal mortality rates less than 70 deaths per 100 000 livebirths (table 1). What type of progress, if any, should these countries be aiming at? Based on the Countdown experience of interacting with countries regarding progress towards global goals, we believe that the provisional SDG targets must be urgently revisited. It is also important for targets to be realistic. The fact that only 25 and six of the 75 Countdown countries will likely reach MDGs 4 and 5, respectively, suggests that the original targets were too ambitious in view of the reported progress in terms of financial flows and health systems factors such as human resources and policies. The Countdown experience taught us the importance of identifying evidence-based interventions, and tracking  	1
coverage change over time on a country-by-country basis. Although monitoring of 73 coverage indicators is a huge task, it provides specific feedback on what needs to be improved, and where. This level of detail is essential, but we also felt a need for a summary measure--the CCI. We found this to be robust, stable, and highly associated with measures of mortality.7 The CCI provides a promising approach to the measurement of universal health coverage, and includes a focus on equity, two pillars that lie at the heart of the health SDG. The large number of SDG targets--169 at some stage-- has brought about substantial criticism.50,51 Although work is under way to trim down this list, the Countdown experience shows that an initially small list of goals and core indicators can rapidly expand with time, as new interventions become available, and as different interest groups lobby--often with strong justification--for inclusion of additional indicators. A rigorous technical process must be in place to ensure the validity and reliability of these new indicators, to make sure monitoring efforts stay coordinated and focused, and to minimise the reporting burden on countries. Countdown found its niche in a plethora of global initiatives: a focus on intervention coverage at country level. Our focus does not overlook other drivers of women's and children's health, such as social or environmental determinants.52 We recognise that biomedical interventions are one of the most important pathways through which distal, social determinants affect health. During the SDG era, tracking progress in social and environmental determinants and understanding how these affect health and development will be just as important as tracking progress in coverage or health status, and will likely face similar data availability challenges as were faced by Countdown. Other aspects of the Countdown experience might be relevant to similar initiatives in the SDG era. Involvement of many stakeholders is essential to ensure that data lead to action. Retaining scientific independence in the midst of stakeholders with different interests and agendas was not always a smooth process, but Countdown managed to achieve and maintain consensus on indicators that should be monitored and disseminated. Positive pressure from stakeholders led to our expansion from child survival in 2003 to the full RMNCH continuum of care. Balancing focus with breadth is not easy, and will likely be even harder in the SDG era, both within the health goal and across all 17 SDGs.53 Countdown engaged with civil society at the international level, as several of its stakeholders represent such constituencies. Engagement at national level, however, was mostly restricted to countries where case studies were done and disseminated. Nevertheless, several of the key Countdown stakeholders led activities at national level that were consistent with our mandate and harmonised with our main messages. A Viewpoint54 in this issue of The Lancet explores future directions for Countdown. Regardless of what lies ahead, 2057	1
our experience in the past 10 years has established the importance and feasibility of a multistakeholder initiative, with independence and a strong technical component, in accelerating progress for the world's mothers and children. The auspicious launch of a Global Financing Facility42 in support of the Every Woman Every Child initiative highlights the need for continued, independent monitoring and accountability in the future.

Executive summary The Lancet Countdown tracks progress on health and climate change and provides an independent assess ment of the health effects of climate change, the implementation of the Paris Agreement,1 and the health implications of these actions. It follows on from the work of the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change,2 which concluded that anthropogenic climate change threatens to undermine the past 50 years of gains in public health, and conversely, that a comprehensive response to climate change could be "the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century". The Lancet Countdown is a collaboration between 24 academic institutions and intergovernmental organ isations based in every continent and with representation from a wide range of disciplines. The collaboration includes climate scientists, ecologists, economists, engineers, experts in energy, food, and transport systems, geographers, mathematicians, social and political scientists, public health professionals, and doctors. It reports annual indicators across five sections: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. The key messages from the 40 indicators in the Lancet Countdown's 2017 report are summarised below.	1
The human symptoms of climate change are unequivocal and potentially irreversible--affecting the health of populations around the world today The impacts of climate change are disproportionately affecting the health of vulnerable populations and people in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). By undermining the social and environmental determinants that underpin good health, climate change exacerbates social, economic, and demographic inequalities, with the impacts eventually felt by all populations. The evidence is clear that exposure to more frequent and intense heatwaves is increasing, with an estimated 125 million additional vulnerable adults exposed to heatwaves between 2000 and 2016 (Indicator 1.2).  	1
During this time, increasing ambient temperatures have resulted in an estimated reduction of 5*3% in outdoor manual labour productivity worldwide (Indicator 1.3). As a whole, the frequency of weatherrelated disasters has increased by 46% since 2000, with no clear upward or downward trend in the lethality of these extreme events (Indicator 1.4), potentially suggesting the beginning of an adaptive response to climate change. Yet the impacts of climate change are projected to worsen with time, and current levels of adaptation will become insufficient in the future. The total value of economic losses resulting from climaterelated events has been increasing since 1990, totalling US$129 billion in 2016. 99% of these economic losses in low-income countries were uninsured (Indicator 4.4). Additionally, in the longer term, altered climatic conditions are contributing to growing vectorial capacity for the transmission of dengue fever by Aedes aegypti, reflecting an estimated 9*4% increase since 1950 (Indicator 1.6). If governments and the global health community do not learn from the past experiences of HIV/AIDS and the recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viruses, another slow response will result in an irreversible and unacceptable cost to human health.	1
The delayed response to climate change over the past 25 years has jeopardised human life and livelihoods Since the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) commenced global efforts to tackle climate change in 1992, most of the indicators tracked by the Lancet Countdown have either shown limited progress, particularly with regards to adaptation, or moved in the wrong direction, particularly in relation to mitigation. Most fundamentally, carbon emissions and global temperatures have continued to increase. An increasing number of countries are assessing their vulnerabilities to climate change, developing adaptation and emergency preparedness plans, and providing climate information to health services (Indicators 2.1, 2.3-2.6). The same is seen at the city level, with more than 449 cities around the world	1

reporting having undertaken a climate change risk assessment (Indicator 2.2). However, the coverage and adequacy of such measures in protecting against the growing risks of climate change to health remain uncertain. Indeed, health and health-related adaptation funding accounts for only 4*6% and 13*3% of total global adaptation spending, respectively (Indicator 4.9). Although there has been some recent progress in strengthening health resilience to climate impacts, it is clear that adaptation to new climatic conditions can only protect up to a point; an analogy to human physiology is useful here. The human body can adapt to insults caused by a self-limiting minor illness with relative ease. However, when disease steadily worsens, positive feedback cycles and limits to adaptation are quickly reached. This is particularly true when many systems are affected and when the failure of one system affects the function of another, as is the case for multiorgan system failure or when the body has already been weakened through repeated diseases or exposures. The same is true for the health consequences of climate change. It acts as a threat multiplier, compounding many of the issues communities already face and strengthening the correlation between multiple health risks, making them more likely to occur simultaneously. Indeed, climate change is not a single-system disease but instead often compounds existing pressures on housing, food and water security, poverty, and many determinants of good health. Adaptation has limits, and prevention is better than cure to avert potentially irreversible effects of climate change. Progress in mitigating climate change since the signing of the UNFCCC has been limited across all sectors, with only modest improvements in carbon emission reduction from electricity generation. Although sustainable travel has increased in Europe and some evidence suggests a decrease in dependence on private motor vehicles in cities in the USA and Australia, the situation is generally less favourable in cities within emerging economies (Indicator 3.7). In addition to a slow transition away from highly polluting forms of electricity generation, this change has yielded a modest improvement in air pollution in some urban centres. However, global populationweighted fine particular matter (PM2*5) exposure has increased by 11*2% since 1990, and about 71% of the 2971 cities in the WHO air pollution database exceed guideline annual PM2*5 exposure (Indicator 3.5). The strength and coverage of carbon pricing covers only 13*1% of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, with the weighted average carbon price of these instruments at $8*81 per tonne of emitted CO2 in 2017 (Indicator 4.7). Furthermore, responses to climate change have yet to fully take advantage of the health co-benefits of mitigation and adaptation interventions, with action taken to date only yielding modest improvements in human wellbeing. In part, this reflects a need for further evidence and research on these ancillary effects and the available cost savings.	1
However, it also reflects a need for more joined-up policy making by health and non-health ministries of national governments. This delayed mitigation response puts the world on a high-end emissions trajectory that will result in global warming of 2*6-4*8C by the end of the century.	1
The voice of the health profession is essential in driving forward progress on climate change and realising the health benefits of this response Following in the footsteps of previous Lancet Commissions, we argue that the health profession not only has the ability but the responsibility to act as public health advocates by communicating the threats and opportunities to the public and policy makers and ensuring climate change is understood as being central to human wellbeing. Attention to health and climate change is growing in the media and in academic reports, with global newspaper coverage of the issue increasing 78% and the number of scientific reports more than tripling since 2007 (Indicator 5.1.1 and 5.2). However, despite these positive examples, the 2017 indicators make it clear that further progress is urgently needed.	1
Although progress has been historically slow, the past 5 years have seen an accelerated response, and in 2017, momentum is building across a number of sectors; the direction of travel is set, with clear and unprecedented opportunities for public health In 2015, the Lancet Commission2 made ten recom mendations to governments to accelerate action in the following 5 years. The Lancet Countdown's 2017 indicators track against these 2015 recommendations, with results suggesting that discernible progress has been made in many of these areas (panel 1), breathing life into previously stagnant mitigation and adaptation efforts. Indeed, the transition to low-carbon electricity generation now appears inevitable. Alongside the Paris Agreement, this progress provides reason to believe that a broader transformation is underway. Following the US Goverment's announced intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, the global community has demonstrated overwhelming support for enhanced action on climate change, affirming clear political will and ambition to reach the treaty's targets. The mitigation and adaptation interventions committed to under the Paris Agreement have very positive shortterm and long-term health benefits, but greater ambition is now essential. Although progress has been historically slow, there is evidence of a recent turning point, with transitions in sectors that are crucial to public health reorienting towards a low-carbon world. These efforts must be greatly accelerated and sustained in the coming decades to meet the commitments, but recent policy changes and the indicators presented here suggest that the direction of travel is set.  	1
Panel 1: Progress towards the recommendations of the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change2 In 2015, we made ten policy recommendations. Of these, good progress has been made against the following recommendations. Recommendation 1: invest in climate change and public health research Since 2007, the number of scientific papers on health and climate change has more than tripled (Indicator 5.2). Recommendation 2: scale-up financing for climate-resilient health systems Spending on health adaptation is 4*63% of global adaptation spend (US$16*46 billion); in 2017, health adaptation from global development and climate financing mechanisms is at an all-time high although absolute spending remains low (Indicators 4.9 and 4.10). Recommendation 3: phase-out coal-fired power In 2015, more renewable energy capacity (150 gigawatts) than fossil fuel capacity was added to the global energy mix. Overall, annual installed renewable generation capacity (almost 2000 gigawatt) exceeds that for coal, with about 80% of this recently added renewable capacity located in China (Indicator 3.2). Although investment in coal capacity has increased since 2006, this investment turned and decreased substantially in 2016, and several countries have now committed to phasing out coal (Indicator 4.1). Recommendation 4: encourage a city-level low-carbon transition to reduce urban pollution Despite historically modest progress in the past two decades, the transport sector is approaching a new threshold, with electric vehicles expected to reach cost parity with their non-electric counterparts by 2018--a phenomenon that was not expected to occur until 2030 (Indicator 3.6).	1
global employment in the renewable energy sector reached 9*8 million people, more than 1 million more people than are employed in fossil fuel extraction sector. The transition has become inevitable. However, in the same year, 1*2 billion people still did not have access to electricity, and 2*7 billion people were relying on the burning of unsafe and unsustainable solid fuels (Indicators 3.3, 4.6, and 3.4). Recommendation 9: agree and implement an international treaty that facilitates the transition to a low-carbon economy In December, 2015, 195 countries signed the Paris Agreement, which provides a framework for enhanced mitigation and adaptation and pledges to keep the global mean temperature rise to well below 2C. Going forward, an enhanced programme of work dedicated to health within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change would provide a clear and essential entry point for health professionals at the national level, ensuring that the implementation of the Paris Agreement maximises the health opportunities for populations around the world. Recommendation 10: Develop a new, independent collaboration to provide expertise in implementing policies that mitigate climate change and promote public health, and to monitor progress over the next 15 years The Lancet Countdown is a collaboration between 24 academic institutions and intergovernmental organisations based in every continent and with representation from a wide range of disciplines. It monitors and reports on indicators across five sections and will continue to do so up to 2030.	1
Recommendation 6: rapidly expand access to renewable energy, unlocking the substantial economic gains available from this transition Every year since 2015, more renewable energy has been added to the global energy mix than all other sources, and in 2016,	1
Between 2017 and 2030, the Lancet Countdown will continue to report annually on progress in implementing the commitments of the Paris Agreement, future commitments that build on them, and the health benefits that result.	1
Introduction Climate change has serious implications for our health, wellbeing, livelihoods, and the structure of organised society. Its direct effects result from rising temperatures and changes in the frequency and strength of storms, floods, droughts, and heatwaves--with physical and mental health consequences. The impacts of climate change will also be mediated through less direct pathways, including changes in crop yields, the burden and  	1
distribution of infectious disease, and in climate-induced population displacement and violent conflict.3-5 Although many of these effects are already seen, their progression in the absence of climate change mitigation will greatly amplify existing global health challenges and inequalities.2 The effects also threaten to undermine many of the social, economic, and environmental drivers of health that have contributed greatly to human progress. Urgent and substantial climate change mitigation will help protect human health from the worst of these effects, and a comprehensive and ambitious response to climate change could transform the health of the world's populations.2 The potential benefits and opportunities are enormous, including cleaning the air of polluted cities, delivering more nutritious diets, ensuring energy, food,	1

Panel 2: Developing Lancet Countdown's indicators: an iterative and open process In developing the Lancet Countdown's indicators, we took a pragmatic approach, taking into account the considerable limitations in data availability, resources, and time. Consequently, the indicators presented here represent what is feasible for 2017 and will evolve over time in response to feedback and data improvements. The purpose of this collaboration is to track progress on the links between public health and climate change, and yet much of the data analysed here were originally collected for purposes not directly relevant to health. Initial analysis therefore principally captures changes in exposure, states, or processes as proxies for health outcomes--the ultimate goal. Employing new methodologies to improve attribution to climate change is a particular priority. Subsequent reports will see the Lancet Countdown set 2030 targets for its indicators that align more directly with the Paris Agreement, allowing an assessment of its implementation during the next 13 years.	1
The indicators presented thus far are the beginning of an ongoing, iterative, and open process, which will work to continuously improve as capacity, data quality, and methods evolve. The objectives of the Lancet Countdown are both ambitious and essential, relying on support from a broad range of actors. To this end, the collaboration welcomes support from academic institutions and technical experts that are able to provide new analytical methods and novel datasets with appropriate geographical coverage. A short overview of several parallel and complementary processes currently underway is provided in the appendix (pp 1-10).	1
and water security, and alleviating poverty and social and economic inequalities. Monitoring this transition, from threat to opportunity, is the central role of the Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change. The collaboration is a partnership of 24 academic institutions from every continent and brings together individuals with a broad range of expertise across disciplines (including climate scientists, ecologists, mathematicians, geographers, engineers, energy, food, and transport experts, economists, social and political scientists, public health professionals, and doctors). Until 2030, the Lancet Countdown will track a series of indicators of progress and to report annually on the state of the climate, the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change (panel 2). The initiative was formed after the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change,2 which concluded that "tackling climate change could be the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century". It builds on and reinforces the work of the expanding group of researchers, health practitioners, national governments, and WHO, who are working to ensure that this opportunity becomes a reality.	1
Indicators of progress on health and climate change In 2016, the Lancet Countdown proposed a set of potential indicators to be monitored and launched a global consultation to define a conclusive set of indicators for 2017.6 A number of factors determined the selection of indicators, including: (1) their relevance to public health, both in terms of the impacts of climate change on health and the health effects of the response to climate change; (2) their relevance to the main anthropogenic drivers of climate change; (3) their geographical coverage and relevance to a broad range of countries and income groups; (4) data availability; and (5) resource and timing constraints. These indicators are divided into five broad sections: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerabilities; adaptation planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement (panel 3). These sections are aligned with the global action agenda on climate change and health that was agreed to at the Second WHO Global Conference on Health and Climate in July, 2016. The results and analysis of each indicator are presented alongside a brief description of the data sources and methods. A more complete account of each indicator can be found in the appendix. For a number of areas, such as the impacts of climate change on mental health or hydrological mapping of flood exposure, a robust methodology for an annual indicator has not been reported, reflecting the complexity of the topic and the paucity of data rather than its lack of importance. The thematic groups and indicator titles provide an overview of the domain being tracked, allowing for the growth and development of these metrics (eg, to more directly capture health outcomes) in subsequent years.	1
Delivering the Paris Agreement for better health The Paris Agreement1 has been ratified at the national level by 153 of 197 parties to the UNFCCC, and covers 84*7% of greenhouse gas emissions at present. The agreement set out an ambitious commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to limit climate change to well below a global average temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aim to limit temperature increases to 1*5 C. 187 countries have committed to near-term (up to 2030) actions to reduce greenhouse gas emission through their nationally determined contributions. Article 4 paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement1 states that each signatory "shall prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions that it intends to achieve". However, the nationally determined contributions of the 153 parties that have ratified the agreement now fall short of the necessary reductions by 2030 to meet the 2C pathway.11  	1
The Lancet Countdown's indicators place national decisions within a broader context. The indicators highlight that: (1) worldwide, total power capacity of preconstruction coal (commitments for new coal power plants) has halved from 2016 to 2017 alone; (2) every year since 2015, more renewable energy has been added to the global energy mix than all other sources combined; (3) the installed costs of renewable energy continue to decrease (solar photovoltaic electricity generation is now cheaper than conventional fossil fuels in an ever-growing number of countries); (4) electric vehicles are poised to reach cost-parity with their petrol-based counterparts; and (5) in 2016, global employment in renewable energy reached 9*8 million people, over 1 million more than that in fossil fuel extraction. These positive examples in recent years must not mask the dangerous consequences of failing to meet the Paris Agreement, the past two decades of relative inaction, the economies and sectors lagging behind, and the enormity of the task ahead, which leave achieving the aims of the Paris Agreement in a precarious position. Much of the data presented should serve as a wake-up call to national governments, businesses, civil society, and the health profession. However, the world has already embarked on a path to a low-carbon and healthier future. Although the pace of action must greatly accelerate, the direction of travel is set.	1
Section 1: Climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability In this section, we provide a set of indicators that track health impacts related to anthropogenic climate change. Such impacts depend on the nature and scale of the hazard, the extent and nature of human exposure to them, and the underlying vulnerability of the exposed population.12 The purpose of these indicators is there fore to measure exposure to climatic hazards and vulnerabilities of people exposed to them, and, over time, to quantify the health impacts of climate change. These impacts, in turn, inform protective adaptation and mitigation interventions (Section 2, Section 3), the economic and financial tools available to enable such responses (Section 4), and the public and political engagement that facilitates them (Section 5). Climate change affects human health primarily through three pathways: direct, ecosystem-mediated, and human institution-mediated pathways.13 Direct effects are diverse, being mediated, for instance, by increases in the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme heat and by increases in average annual temperature (leading to, for example, greater heatrelated mortality). Rising incidence of other extremes of weather, such as floods and storms, increase the risk of drowning and injury, damage to human settlements, spread of water-borne disease, and mental health sequelae.13 Ecosystem-mediated impacts include changes  	1

limitations and challenges encountered in the selection of each indicator) are provided in the appendix (p 16). The indirect indicators (Indicators 1.5-1.8) each provide a proof of concept rather than being fully comprehensive, focusing variably on a specific diseases, populations, or locations. Additionally, in future reports by the Lancet Countdown, we will seek to capture indicators of the links between climate change and air pollution, and with mental illness.	1

population displacement from sea-level rise, and occupational health risks are examples of human institution-mediated impacts. Although reported data, and indeed some of the data presented here, have traditionally focused on impacts such as the spread of infectious diseases and mortality from extreme weather, the health effects from noncommunicable diseases are just as important. Mediated through a variety of pathways, they take the form of cardiovascular disease, acute and chronic respiratory disease from worsening air pollution and aero-allergens, or the often-unseen mental health effects of extreme weather events or of population displacement.14,15 Indeed, emerging evidence is suggesting links between a rising incidence of chronic kidney disease, dehydration, and climate change.16,17 Eight indicators were selected and developed for this section. Headline findings for all indicators are provided at the beginning of each indicator; additional detailed disussion on the data and methods used (as well as the	1
This indicator reports that people experience far more than the global mean temperature rise. This indicator reports that between 2000 and 2016, human exposure to warming was about 0*9oC, more than double the global area average temperature rise during the same period. Increasing temperatures can exacerbate existing health problems in populations and introduce new health threats (including cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease). The extent to which human populations are exposed to this temperature change, and thus the health implications of temperature change, depends on the detailed spatiotemporal trends of population and temperature over time. Temperature anomalies were calculated relative to 1986-2008 from the European Research Area, produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). This dataset uses ECMWF climate reanalysis to give a description of recent climate, produced by combining models with observations. Changes in each country population were obtained from NASA's Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center and the data were projected onto the gridded population. Exposure-weighted warming from 2000 to 2016 (0*9C) is much higher than the area-weighted warming (0*4C) during the same period (figure 1). Hence, mean exposure to warming is more than double the global warming since 2000. The increase in exposure relative to the global average is driven partly by growing population densities in India, parts of China, and sub-Saharan Africa. Accounting for population when assessing temperature change provides a vital insight into how human wellbeing is likely to be affected by temperature change, with the analysis here showing that temperature change where people are living is much higher than average global warming. Details of the global distribution of this warming can be found in the appendix (p 16).	1
Indicator 1.2: Health effects of heatwaves This indicator reports that between 2000 and 2016, the number of vulnerable people exposed to heatwave events increased by about 125 million, with a record 175 million more people exposed to heatwaves in 2015. The health impacts of extreme heat range from direct heat stress and heat stroke, to exacerbations of preexisting heart failure, and even an increased incidence of  	1
Indicator 1.3: Change in labour capacity This indicator reports that global labour capacity in rural populations exposed to temperature change is estimated to have decreased by 5*3% from 2000 to 2016. Higher temperatures pose profound threats to occupational health and labour productivity, particularly for people undertaking manual, outdoor labour in hot areas. This indicator shows the change in labour capacity (and thus productivity) worldwide and for rural regions specifically, weighted by population (appendix p 18). Loss of labour capacity has important implications for the livelihoods of individuals, families, and communities, especially those relying on subsistence farming. Estimation of labour capacity is based on wet bulb globe temperatures, as described by Watts and colleagues.2 We estimated change in outdoor labour productivity as a percentage relative to the reference period (1986-2008) (figure 4). Labour capacity is estimated to have decreased by 5*3% between 2000 and 2016, with a dramatic decrease of more than 2% between 2015 and 2016. Although there are some peaks of increased labour capacity (notably in 2000, 2004, and 2008), the overwhelming trend is one of reduced capacity. These effects are most notable in some of the most vulnerable countries in the world (figure 5). This indicator only captures the effects of heat on rural labour capacity. The Lancet Countdown will work to expand this metric to capture impacts on labour capacity in other sectors, including manufacturing,  	1
acute kidney injury from dehydration in vulnerable populations. Elderly people, children younger than 12 months, and people with chronic cardiovascular and renal disease are particularly sensitive to these changes.13 Our definition of a heatwave is a period of more than 3 days during which the minimum temperature is greater than the 99th percentile of the historical minima (1986-2008 average).18 This metric therefore focuses on periods of high night-time temperatures, which are crucial in denying vulnerable people vital recuperation between hot days. Heatwave data were calculated against the historical period 1986-2008. The population for the exposure calculations was limited to people older than 65 years (as this age group is most vulnerable to the health impacts of heatwaves), and data were obtained on a percountry basis from the UN World Population Prospects archives for each year considered. The highest number of exposure events was recorded in 2015, with about 175 million additional people exposed to heatwaves (figure 2). Over time, the mean number of heatwave days experienced by people during any one heatwave (exposure-weighted) increases at a much faster rate than the global mean (area-weighted) number of heatwave days per heatwave (figure 3) because of high population densities in areas where heatwaves have occurred.	1
construction, transportation, tourism, and agriculture. Through collaboration with HEAT-SHIELD,19 the Lancet Countdown will work to develop this process, providing more detailed analysis of labour capacity loss and the health implications of heat and heatwaves worldwide.20	1
Indicator 1.4: Lethality of weather-related disasters This indicator reports that the frequency of weatherrelated disasters has increased by 46% from 2007 to 2016 (compared with the 1990-99 average), with no clear upward or downward trend in the lethality of these extreme events. Weather-related events have been associated with more than 90% of all disasters worldwide in the past 20 years. As expected, considering its population and area, Asia is the continent most affected by weather-related disasters. 2843 events were recorded between 1990 and 2016, affecting 4*8 billion people and killing 505 013 people. Deaths from natural hazard-related disasters are largely concentrated in poor countries.21 Crucially, this must be understood in the context of potentially overwhelming 587	1
health impacts of future climate change, worsening profoundly in the coming years. Indeed, the 2015 Lancet Commission estimated that an additional 1*4 billion drought exposure events and 2*3 billion flood exposure events will occur by the end of the century, showing clear public health limits to adaptation.2 Disaster impact is a function of hazard and vulnerability, with vulnerability from a climate change perspective sometimes defined as a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.22 This indicator measures the ratio of the number of deaths to the number of people affected by weather-related disasters. Weather-related disasters include droughts, floods, extreme temperature events, storms, and wildfires. The health impacts of weather-related disasters expand beyond mortality alone, including injuries, mental health impacts, spread of disease, and food and water insecurity. Data for the calculations for this indicator come from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT). Here, in line with the EM-DAT data used for analysis, a disaster is defined as either: (1) ten or more people killed; (2) 100 or more people affected; (3) a declaration of a state of emergency; or (4) a call for international assistance. Between 1994 and 2013, the frequency of reported weather-related events (mainly floods and storms) increased substantially. However, this trend might be partially accounted for by information systems having improved in the past 35 years, and statistical data are now more available because of increased sociocultural sensitivity to disaster consequences and occurrence.23 From 2007 to 2016, EM-DAT recorded an average of 306 weather-related disasters per year, an increase of	1
46% from the 1990-99 average.24 However, owing to impressive poverty reduction and health adaptation efforts, this increase in weather-related disasters has not yet been accompanied by any discernible trend in number of deaths or in number of people affected by disasters (or in the ratio of these two; figure 6). Indeed, separating out the disasters by the type of climate and weather hazard associated with the disaster, we found a significant decrease in the number of people affected by floods worldwide, equating to a decrease of 3 million people annually. Importantly, best available estimates and projections expect a sharp reversal in these trends in the coming decades, and it is notable that mortality associated with weather-related disasters has increased in many countries, many of which are high-income countries, illustrating that no country is immune to the impacts of climate change (appendix p 19). The relative stability of the number of deaths in a disaster as a proportion of those affected, despite an increase in the number of disasters, could be interpreted in a number of ways. One plausible conclusion is that this represents an increase in health service provision and risk reduction. However, although weather-related disasters have become more frequent in the past three to four decades, the data here do not capture the severity of such events--a factor directly relevant to a country's vulnerability and ability to adapt.22 It is also important to note the difficulties in discerning overall trends, owing to the stochastic nature of the data and the relatively short time series. This poses limitations on the significance of findings that can be drawn from analysis to date. Improving the validity of this indicator will be a focus going forward.  	1
This indicator reports that global health initiatives have improved the health profile of populations around the world--a trend that unmitigated climate change is expected to undermine. Disease occurrence is determined by a complex composite of social and environmental conditions and health service provision, all of which vary geographically. Nonetheless, some diseases are particularly sensitive to variations in climate and weather and might therefore be expected to vary with both longer-term climate change and shorter-term extreme weather events.13 This indicator draws from Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2015 mortality estimates to show trends in deaths associated with seven climate-sensitive diseases since 1990 (figure 7). These disease trends reveal worldwide increases in dengue mortality, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, Latin American, and Caribbean regions, with some peak years (including 1998) known to be associated with El Nino conditions.25 Beyond climate, likely drivers of dengue mortality include trade, urbanisation, global and local mobility, and climate variability. The association between increased dengue mortality and climate change is therefore complex.26 It naturally follows that an increased spread of the disease resulting from climate change will be an important contributing factor in the increased likelihood of an associated increase in mortality. Malignant melanoma is a distinctive example of a noncommunicable disease with a clear link to ultraviolet exposure. Mortality has been increasing steadily despite advances in surveillance and treatment, although increased exposures also occur as a result of changing lifestyles (eg, an increase in sun tanning). Heat and cold exposure is a potentially important aspect of climateinfluenced mortality, although the underlying attribution of deaths to these causes in the estimates is uncertain.27-32 Deaths directly related to forces of nature have been adjusted for the effects of the most severe seismic events. Of the ten highest country-year mortality estimates due to forces of nature, seven were directly due to specific seismic activity, and these have been discounted by replacing with the same countries' force of nature mortality for the following year. The remaining major peaks relate to three extreme weather events (Bangladesh cyclone of 1991, Venezuela floods and mudslides of 1999, and Myanmar cyclone of 2008), which accounted for more than 300 000 deaths. Overall, the findings highlight the effectiveness and success of global health initiatives in largely reducing deaths associated with these diseases since 1990. Furthermore, these trends provide a proxy for the global health profile of climate-sensitive diseases and thus, to some degree, indication of existing vulnerabilities and exposures to them.	1
Indicator 1.6: Climate-sensitive infectious diseases This indicator reports that climate trends have led to a global increase in the vectorial capacity for the transmission of dengue from A aegypti and Aedes albopictus, of 3*0% and 5*9%, respectively, compared with 1990 levels, and of 9*4% and 11*1%, respectively, compared with 1950 levels. Despite a decreasing overall trend, infectious diseases still account for about 20% of the global burden of disease and underpin more than 80% of international health hazards, as classified by WHO.33,34 Climatic factors are routinely implicated in the epidemiology of infectious diseases, and they often interact with other factors, including behavioural, demographic, socioeconomic, topographic, and other environmental factors, to influence infectious disease emergence, distribution, incidence, and burden.4,35 Understanding the contribution of climate change to infectious disease risk is thus complex but necessary for advancing climate change mitigation and	1
adaptation policies.17 This indicator is divided into two components: (1) a systematic literature review of the links between climate change and infectious diseases; and (2) a vectorial capacity model for the transmission of dengue virus by the climate-sensitive vectors. For the first component, we systematically reviewed the scientific literature describing effects of climate change and infectious diseases (appendix p 23), in which evolutionary trends in knowledge and direction of the impact of climate change disease risk associations were measured (figure 8). The number of new reports fitting the search criteria in 2016 (n=89) was the highest yet reported, almost double the number of reports in 2015 (n=50) and more than triple the number of reports in 2014 (n=25). During this period, the complexity of interactions between climate change and infectious disease has been increasingly recognised and understood. Trends in the global potential for dengue virus transmission (as represented by vectorial capacity in the mosquito vectors A aeqypti and A albopictus, the principal vectors of dengue) are presented in figure 9. WHO defines vectorial capacity as the rate (usually daily) at which a bloodsucking insect population generates new inoculations from a currently infectious case. We 590	1
conducted a global, mechanistic investigation of changes in annual transmission potential for dengue fever, a model, high-burden, climate-sensitive vector-borne disease. For both vectors, vectorial capacity in locations where these vectors exist reached its highest or equal highest average level in 2015 during the period considered (figure 9). This consolidates a clear and significant increase in vectorial capacity starting in the late 1970s (3*0% and 6*0% increases in vectorial capacity compared with 1990 levels for A aegypti and A albopictus, respectively). Nearly all Aedes-positive countries showed relative increases in vectorial capacity for both vectors during the period considered (figure 9). Annual numbers of cases of dengue fever have doubled every decade since 1990, with 58*4 million apparent cases (95% CI 23*6 million-121*9 million) in 2013, accounting for more than 10 000 deaths and 1*14 million disability-adjusted lifeyears (95% CI 0*73 million-1*98 million).36 Climate change has been suggested as one potential contributor to this increase in burden.37 A aegypti and A albopictus also carry other important emerging or re-emerging arboviruses, including Yellow Fever, Chikungunya, Mayaro, and Zika viruses, which are probably similarly responsive to climate change.  	1
This indicator reports that the number of under nourished people in the 30 most vulnerable countries (those that are geographically climate-vulnerable, have very high levels of undernutriton, and have high levels of regional dependency for food production) has increased from 398 million people in 1990 to 422 million people in 2016. The purpose of this indicator is to track the extent to which health will be compromised by climate change in countries where both dependence on domestic production of food and levels of undernourishment (which is strongly related to undernutrition) are already high at present. Climate change could further compromise health through changes in localised temperature and precipitation, manifested in reduced yields. Food markets are increasingly globalised, and food security is increasingly driven by human systems. In response to decreasing yields caused by temperature increases, governments, communities, and organisations can and will undertake adaptation activities that might variously include breeding programmes, expansion of farmland, increased irrigation, or switching crops. However, the greater the loss of yield potential due to temperature increases, the more difficult adaptation becomes for populations dependent on domestic food supply. Increasing temperatures have been shown to reduce global wheat production by 6% for each 1C increase.43-45 Rice yields are sensitive to increases in night temperatures, with each 1C increase in growing-season minimum temperature in the dry season resulting in a 10% decrease in rice grain yield.46 Higher temperatures have been demonstrated rigorously to have a negative impact on crop yields in countries in lower latitudes.47-49	1
Isolating the impact of climate change on health through the indirect impacts on food security is complicated because policies, institutions, and the actions of individuals, organisations, and countries strongly influence the extent to which food systems are resilient to climate hazards and adapt to climate change and whether individual households are able to access and afford sufficient nutritious food. For example, with respect to undernourishment, vulnerability has been shown to be more dependent on adaptive capacity (such as infra structure and markets) and sensitivity (such as forest cover and rain-fed agriculture) than exposure (such as temperature change, droughts, floods, storms).38 In view of the role human systems have in mediating the links between climate, food, and health, the chosen indicators focus on abiotic and biotic indicators and population vulnerabilities, considering both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Undernutrition has been identified as the largest health impact of climate change in the 21st century.13,39-42	1
Figure 8: Systematic review of scientific literature about climate-sensitive infectious diseases (A) Number of academic reports about climate-sensitive infectious diseases, by year. (B) Proportion of responses reported in publications, by year and direction of impact.	1
Moreover, agriculture in lower latitudes tends to be more marginal, and more people are food insecure. Using data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), this indicator focuses on vulnerability to undernutrition. Countries are selected for inclusion on the basis of three criteria: (1) the presence of moderate or high levels of undernourishment, reflecting vulnerability; (2) their physical location, focusing on geographies where a changing climate is predicted with high confidence to have a negative impact on the yields to staples produced; and (3) dependence on regional production for at least half of the population's cereal consumption, reflecting high exposure to localised climate hazards. 30 countries in Africa or southern Asia are included. The aggregated indicators show the total number of undernourished people in these 30 countries, multiplied by total dependence on regional production of grains (figure 10). This gives a measure of how exposed undernourished populations that are already highly dependent on regionally produced grains are to localised climate hazards.	1

The regions with the highest vulnerability to undernutrition are also areas where yield losses due to climate warming are predicted to be relatively high, thus increasing the vulnerability of these populations to the negative health consequences of undernutrition. High dependence on one crop increases the vulnerability of a country further. For example, Kenya, with a domestic pro duction dependency for cereals of almost 80%, is 69% dependent on maize, is experiencing high levels of under nutrition, and is particularly vulnerable to climate-related yield losses. Going forward, these data will be refined through country-level exploration, incorporation of the predicted impact of warming on yield losses, and incorporation of key temperature indicators such as 592	1
Indicator 1.7.2: Marine primary productivity Decreasing fish consumption is an indication of food insecurity, especially in local shoreline communities that depend on marine sources for food. These communities are especially vulnerable to any decreases in marine primary productivity affecting fish stocks.52 This is particularly concerning for the 1 billion people in the world who rely on fish as their principal source of protein, placing them at increased risk of stunting (prevented from growing or developing properly) and malnutrition from food insecurity.53 Fish are also important for providing micronutrients such as zinc, iron, vitamin A, vitamin B12,  	1
and omega-3 fatty acids. If fish stocks continue to decrease, up to 1*4 billion people are estimated to become deficient and at increased risk of certain diseases, particularly those associated with the cardiovascular system.54,55 Marine primary productivity is determined by abiotic and biotic factors; measuring these globally and identifying relevant marine basins is complex. Factors such as sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, coral bleaching, and phytoplankton numbers are key determinants of marine primary productivity. Other local determinants have particularly strong effects on marine primary productivity. For example, harmful algal blooms result from uncontrolled algal growth producing deadly toxins. The consumption of seafood contaminated with these toxins, such as those produced by Alexandrium tamarense, is often very dangerous to human health and potentially fatal.56 Changes in sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity from 1985 to present are shown for 12 fishery locations essential for aquatic food security. Data were obtained from NASA's Earth Observatory Databank, and mapped across to the important basins outlined in the appendix (p 34). From 1985 to 2016, a 1C increase in sea surface temperature (from an annual average of 22*74C to 23*73C) was recorded in these locations.57 This indicator requires substantial further work to draw out the attribution to climate change and the health outcomes that might result. A case study on food security and fish stocks in the Persian Gulf is presented in the appendix (p 39).	1
already being forced to migrate, worldwide. The total number of people vulnerable to migration might increase to 1 billion by the end of the century without significant further action on climate change. Climate change-induced migration can occur through a variety of different social and political pathways, ranging from sea level rise and coastal erosion to changes in extreme and average precipitation and temperature that reduce the arability of land and exacerbating food and water security issues. Estimates of future so-called climate change migrants vary widely, but range from 25 million people to 1 billion people by 2050.58 Such variation indicates the complexity of the multifactorial nature of human migration, which depends on an interaction of local environmental, social, economic, and political factors. For example, in Syria, many attribute the initial and continued conflict to the rural-to-urban migration that resulted from a climate change-induced drought.59,60 However, the factors leading to the violence are wide-ranging and complex, with clear quantifiable attribution particularly challenging. Indeed, climate change, as a threat multiplier and an accelerant of instability, is often thought of as important in exacerbating the likelihood of conflict. Nonetheless, migration driven by climate change has potentially severe impacts on mental and physical health, both directly and by disrupting essential health and social services.61 Despite the methodological difficulties in proving a direct causal relationship between climate change and population displacement, this is possible in some areas. This indicator focuses on these situations and makes attempts at isolating instances where climate change is 593	1
Coastal erosion, wetland loss, reduced accretion, barrier island erosion, subsidence, and saltwater intrusion were caused by dredging, dikes, levees, controlling the Mississippi River, and agricultural practices; climate change is now bringing sea-level rise	1
Panel 4: Mental health and climate change Measuring changes in the effects of climate change on mental health and wellbeing is difficult. Although this is partly because of problems of attribution, the main measurement difficulty lies in the inherently complicated nature of mental health, which embraces a diverse array of outcomes (eg, anxiety and mood disorders), many of which co-occur and all of which vary with contexts and during lifetimes. They are products of long and complex causal pathways, many of which can be traced back to distal but potent root causes, such as famine, war, and poverty, of which climate change is an accelerator.69 Mental health, with its inherent intricacy, is a field of study where systems thinking is likely to be particularly valuable. A first step, therefore, in tracking progress on mental health and climate change is to build a conceptual framework using systems thinking. Initial work in partnership with the University of Sydney has begun to trace through the many direct and indirect causal pathways to aid the identification of indicators. Many challenges are immediately apparent (eg, how to gather and interpret highly subjective measures across cultures and income settings). Although further work and engagement with other partners will be necessary, potential indicators might focus on a range of issues, including: national and local mental health emergency response capacity to climate-related extreme events; the extent to which climate change is considered within national mental health strategies; or the social and psychological effect of uninsured economic losses that result from extreme weather events.	1
the sole contributory factor in migration decisions. Sea level rise is the clearest example, although other examples exist (table 1). Estimating the number of people who have involuntarily migrated (both internally and inter nationally) as a result of climate change alone helps overcome the complexity of accounting for other societal, economic, and environmental factors that also influence migration. On the basis of data derived from peer-reviewed academic reports (appendix p 40 for full details), the 4400 people who have been forced to migrate solely because of climate change (table 1) is an underestimate because it excludes cases in which more than one factor could be contributing to a migration decision, such as a combination of both climate-related sea level rise and coastal erosion not associated with climate change (possibly such as the village of Vunidogola, relocated by the Fijian Government in 2014 for such reasons, and the planned relocation of the Fijian village of Narikoso by 2018).62-64 594	1
In the long term, human exposure and vulnerability to ice sheet collapse is increasing as the number of people living close to the coast and at elevations close to sea level increases. In 1990, 450 million people lived within 20 km of the coast and less than 20 m above sea level.65 In 2000, 634 million people (about 10% of the global population), of whom 360 million live in urban centres, lived below 10 m above sea level (the highest vertical resolution investigated).66 With 2000 as a baseline, the population living below 10 m above sea level will increase from 634 million people to 1005-1091 million people by 2050 and to 830-1184 million people by 2100.67 From 2100 and beyond, without mitigation and adaptation interventions, more than 1 billion people might need to migrate because of sea level rise caused by any ice sheet collapse.67,68 Although this indicator is not yet able to capture the true number of people forced to migrate because of climate change, that at least 4400 people are already forced to migrate because of climate change only is concerning and demonstrates that there are limits to adaptation. That this is a significant underestimate further highlights the need to mitigate climate change and improve the adaptive capacity of populations to reduce future forced migration. Importantly, only instances of migration where climate change is isolated as the only factor are captured. New approaches will be necessary to more accurately estimate the number of people forced to migrate because of climate change and to capture situations where climate change has an important contributory role alongside other social and economic considerations.	1
Conclusion Climate change affects health through diverse direct and indirect mechanisms. The indicators presented here provide an overview of some of these effects and capture exposure, impact, and underlying vulnerabilities. Going forward, indicators will be developed to better measure direct health outcome from climate change in addition to exposure and vulnerabilities. The indicators will be developed continuously to more directly capture mortality and morbidity outcomes from communicable and non-communicable diseases. Work is already underway to produce new indicators to capture  	1
these concepts for future reports. One such ongoing process is focusing on mental health and climate change (panel 4). Adaptation pathways can help to minimise some of the negative health impacts of global warming, especially for the lower range of projected average temperature rises. However, there are powerful limits to adaptation, and we have drawn attention to the non-linearity and the spatial distribution of the health impacts of climate change. The indicators demonstrate clearly that these impacts are experienced in all parts of the world today and provide a strong imperative for both adaptation and mitigation interventions to protect and promote public health.	1
Section 2: Adaptation, planning, and resilience for health Climate change adaptation is defined by the Inter governmental Panel on Climate Change as the "adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities".70 With respect to health, adaptation consists of efforts to reduce injury, illness, disability, and suffering from climate-related causes. Resilience has been defined by the Rockefeller Foundation as "the capacity of individuals, communities, and systems to survive, adapt, and grow in the face of stress and shocks, and even transform when conditions require it".71 In the context of climate change and health, resilience is an attribute of individuals, communities, and health-care systems; resilience at all levels can reduce adverse health outcomes of climate change and should be a goal of adaptation planning. Identifying indicators of resilience and adaptation is challenging. Resilience is related to, but not synonymous with, preparedness, response, resource management, and coordination capacity. Understanding the resilience of a population's health and health systems at present provides some indication of resilience to climate change, although direct indicators measuring this have not yet been developed by the Lancet Countdown. The indicators presented here are predominantly process-based, focusing on health adaptation planning, capacity, and response. Although the underlying resilience of communities is present to some extent in all indicators in this section, it is currently only captured directly for health systems. Most indicators that follow will therefore focus more specifically on health adaptation. We have identified six indicators. Headline findings for all indicators are provided at the beginning of each indicator; detailed discussion of the data and methods used is available in the appendix (p 49).	1
Indicator 2.1: National adaptation plans for health This indicator reports that 30 out of 40 countries responding to the survey have a national health adaptation plan or strategy approved by the relevant national health authority.  	1
Panel 5: WHO--United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Climate and Health Country Profile project The WHO-UNFCCC Climate and Health Country Profile Project forms the foundation of WHO's national level provision of information and monitoring of progress in this field. The profiles, developed in collaboration with ministries of health and other health determining sectors, support evidence-based decision making to strengthen the climate resilience of health systems and promote actions that improve health while reducing carbon emissions. In part, the data used in the development of the climate and health country profiles are collected through a biennial WHO Climate and Health Country Survey. Data from this survey are reported on for Indicators 2.1, 2.5, and 2.6. The 2015 baseline survey findings for 40 responding nations are presented in this report (a complete list of country respondents is provided in the appendix, p 49). The findings include countries from all WHO regions (high-income, middle-income, and low-income groups) and with varying levels of risks and vulnerabilities to the health effects of climate change. The 2015 survey data were validated as part of the national consultation process seeking input on respective WHO-UNFCCC Climate and Health Country Profiles from key in-country stakeholders, including representatives of the ministry of health, ministry of environment, meteorological services, and WHO country and regional technical officers. The validated data presented in this report tended to include many countries that are actively working on climate and health with WHO; as such, the results here are indicative and are not meant to be inferred as an exact indicator of global status. The number of country respondents is expected to double in subsequent iterations of the survey. As such, the results represent the beginning of the development of a more comprehensive survey and offer insights to findings at the start of this process.	1
Effective national responses to climate risks require that the health sector identify strategic goals in response to anticipated and unanticipated threats. A crucial step in achieving these strategic goals is developing national health adaptation plans and outlining priority actions, resource requirements, and a specific timeline and process for implementation. This indicator tracks the policy commitments of national governments for health and climate change adaptation, and data are drawn from the recent WHO Climate and Health Country Survey (panel 5). Of the 40 countries responding to the survey, 30 reported having a national adaptation strategy for health approved by their Ministry of Health or relevant health authority (figure 11). Among these 30 countries are countries with a health component of their National Adaptation Plan, which was established by the UNFCCC to help nations identity medium-term and long-term adaptation needs and develop and implement programmes to address those needs.72 There is a need for caution in extrapolating the results to global level because many of the respondent countries have received support from WHO in developing and implementing their plans.73,74 Nonetheless, with 75% of respondents in the survey having an approved national health adaptation plan, there is evidence that the need to adapt to climate change is recognised. Countries with national health adaptation plans are found in all regions and, perhaps most importantly, include some of the most vulnerable countries in Africa, southeast Asia, and South America. In future iterations of the survey, data	1
will be gathered on the content and quality of these adaptation plans, their level of implementation, the main priorities for health adaptation, internal monitoring, and review processes, and the level of funding available to support policy interventions.	1
This indicator reports that, of the 499 self-reporting cities in the Carbon Disclosure Project 2016 information request, 45% have climate change risk assessments in place. 55% of the world's population lives in cities, where key health infrastructure is often concentrated.75 These urban centres are increasingly at risk from climate change, with negative impacts predicted for human health and health services. To improve cities' ability to adapt to climate change, National Adaptation Plans must be complemented with city-level responses. Indeed, cities have a unique opportunity to provide adaptation measures that help improve the resilience of urban populations, while also helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change on public health.76 Data for this indicator are from the 2016 global survey of the Compact of Mayors and the Carbon Disclosure Project. According to a Carbon Disclosure Project 2016 information request, 45% of the 449 cities with public responses (533 cities responded overall) reported having undertaken a climate change risk or vulnerability assessment for their local government (figure 12). Most cities with climate change risk assessments are in high-income countries (118 cities), whereas only 42 cities are in low-income countries. This partly reflects the fact that more cities in high-income countries were surveyed and that these cities have a greater capacity to develop such plans. Most respondents were cities in	1
high-income countries (236 cities in high-income countries vs 61 cities in low-income countries). European cities in this survey have the highest number of climate change risk assessments (56 cities, representing 83% of European cities surveyed). Conversely, only 28% of surveyed African cities have climate change risk assessments. This has serious implications for the adaptive capacity of some of the most vulnerable populations to climate change in low-income countries. A concerted effort must be made to increase the number of climate change risk assessments in cities in low-income countries so as to better understand their vulnerability to climate change impacts and implement adaptation actions.	1
Indicator 2.3: Detection and early warning of, preparedness for, and response to climate-related health emergencies This indicator reports that, because of focused investment in the implementation of the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, national capacities relevant to climate adaptation and resilience, including disease surveillance and early detection, multihazard public health emergency preparedness and response, and the associated human resources to perform these public health functions, have increased markedly from 2010 to 2016 in all world regions. Many initiatives at community, national, regional, and global levels support strengthening country capacities for health emergency and disaster risk management, and they complement the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, Sustainable Development Goal 3D, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and the IHR 2005. Under IHR 2005, all States Parties should report annually  	1
to the World Health Assembly on the implementation of the regulations.77-79 To facilitate this process, WHO developed an IHR Monitoring questionnaire, interpreting the Core Capacity Requirements in Annex 1 of IHR (2005) into 20 indicators for 13 capacities (panel 6).80,81 These metrics can serve as important proxies of health-system adaptive capacity and system resilience because they measure the extent to which health systems show a range of attributes necessary to detect, prepare for, and respond to public health emergencies, some of which are climate-sensitive. Four capacities (human resources, surveillance, preparedness, and response) reflecting seven indicators from the IHR Monitoring questionnaire are reported here. Additional details of all four IHR Capacities are available in the appendix (p 51).  	1
The first of these capacities is human resources, which reflects a single indicator: human resources available to implement the IHR Core Capacities. This is a useful proxy in lieu of an indicator that looks at specific capacity for health adaptation to climate change (figure 13A). In 2010, capacity scores ranged from 25% in Africa to 57% in western Pacific. Human resource capacity had improved markedly by 2016, when average capacity was 67% (with the lowest score in the African region reporting 51%, and the highest in the western Pacific region reporting 89%). Second, surveillance capacity summarises two indicators in the IHR Monitoring questionnaire: (1) indicator-based surveillance includes an early warning function for early detection of a public health event; and (2) event-based surveillance is established and 597	1
functioning. This capacity score is used as a proxy for a health system's ability to anticipate and identify outbreaks and changing patterns of climate-sensitive infectious Panel 6: The International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005) The IHR (2005), which entered into force in 2007, is legally binding on 196 States Parties, including all WHO member states. It requires States Parties to detect, assess, notify and report, and respond promptly and effectively to public health risks and public health emergencies of international concern (IHR Article 5, 13) and to develop, strengthen, and maintain the capacity to perform these functions (IHR Article 5). Examples of required core capacities include: national legislation, policy, and financing; public health surveillance; preparedness and response; risk communication; human resources; and laboratory services. Under the IHR (2005), all States Parties should report to the World Health Assembly annually on the implementation of IHR (2005). To facilitate this process, WHO developed an IHR Monitoring questionnaire.80 The method of estimation calculates the proportion of attributes (a set of specific elements or functions that reflect the performance or development of a specific indicator) reported to be implemented in a country. Since 2010, 195 States Parties have submitted self-reports at least once. Indicator 2.3 is drawn from the results of these questionnaires,81 to which 129 of 196 States Parties responded in 2016.81 A	1
diseases, such as zoonosis and food-related outbreaks. Globally, 129 reporting States Parties scored 88% for this capacity in 2016 (figure 13B). This proportion has increased steadily since 2010 (average score of 63%), indicating that health systems have increasing capacity for early detection of public health events. Third, preparedness capacity reflects that a Multihazard National Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan is developed and implemented. This indicator looks at the presence of a plan, the implementation of the plan, and the ability for this plan to operate under unexpected stress. Of responding countries, progress can be seen in all world regions, from a global average of 49% in 2010 to 76% in 2016 (figure 13C). Finally, response capacity reflects the availability and functioning of public health emergency response mechanisms and infection prevention and control at national and hospital levels. This capacity is an important proxy for the ability of the health system to mobilise effective responses when shocks or stresses are detected.	1
All countries had 73-91% response capacity in 2016 (figure 13D), with notable progress in Africa between 2010 (47%) and 2016 (73%). There are some limitations to considering these capacities. Most importantly, IHR survey responses are self-reported; although national-level external verification has begun, it remains relatively limited. Additionally, these findings capture potential capacity, not action. Finally, the quality of surveillance for early detection and warning, and the impact of that surveillance on public health, are not shown. Response systems have been inadequate in numerous public health emergencies, so the presence of such plans is not a proxy for their effectiveness.	1
Indicator 2.4: Climate information services for health This indicator reports that, out of the 100 WHO member states responding to a 2015 survey by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 73% report providing climate information to the health sector in their country. This indicator measures the proportion of countries whose meteorological and hydrological services selfreported to the WMO in 2015 about tailored climate information, products, and services provided to their national public health sector.82 73% of the 100 responding WHO member states reported providing climate information to the health sector in their country. Response rates for the 2015 WMO survey were 71% in the African region, 67% in the eastern Mediterranean region, 79% in the European region, 81% in the Americas, 67% in the southeast Asia region, and 44% in the western Pacific region. Taking into account the total number of WHO member states (respondent and non-respondent) per WHO region, only 14*8-51*4% are known to provide climate information to the health sector (figure 14), and 18-55% did not provide information. However, it is important to note that with a 49% nonresponse rate, this sample is not representative of all countries, and these results were self-reported. Crucially, this indicator does not capture the type of climate products made available, quality of the data provided, the ways in which the health sector makes use of these data (if at all), and whether the data are presented in a format and timely fashion relevant to public health. Future WMO surveys will aim to provide greater insight to the specific applications of climate information. Further information is available in the appendix (p 54).	1
Indicator 2.5: National assessments of climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation for health This indicator reports that more than two thirds of countries responding to the survey have conducted a national assessment of climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation for health. National assessments of climate change impacts, vul nerability, and adaptation for health allow governments  	1
to understand more accurately the extent and magnitude of potential threats to health from climate change, the effectiveness of current adaptation and mitigation policies, and future policy and programme requirements. Although ments might vary in scope between national assess countries, the number of countries that have done a national assessment of climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation for health is a key indicator to monitor the global availability of information required for adequate management of health services, infrastructure, and capacities to address climate change. This indicator tracks the number of countries that have national assessments and is based on responses to the 2015 WHO Climate and Health Country Survey (panel 5). More than two thirds of the countries sampled (27 of 40 countries) reported having done a national assessment of impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation for health (figure 15). These countries include all regions, and some countries are particularly vulnerable; for instance, of the nine responding countries in the southeast Asia region, eight countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Timor-Leste) reported having national assessments of impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation for health. Increasing global coverage of countries with national vulnerability and adaptation assessments for health is the result of WHO's support to countries through projects and technical guidance.87	1
Indicator 2.6: Climate-resilient health infrastructure This indicator reports that 16 of 40 responding countries (40%) have implemented activities to increase the climate resilience of their health infrastructure. Functioning health infrastructure is essential during emergencies. Climate-related events, such as severe storms and flooding, might compromise electricity and water supplies, interrupt supply chains, disable trans portation links, and disrupt communications and IT networks, which reduces the capacity to provide medical care. This indicator measures efforts by countries to increase the climate resilience of health infrastructure. The climate resiliency of health infrastructure reflects the extent to which these systems can prepare for and 599	1

adapt to changes in climate affecting the system. Data are drawn from the WHO Climate and Health Country Survey (panel 5). Only 16 of 40 countries (40%) reported having taken measures to increase the climate resilience of their health infrastructure (figure 16). These results suggest widespread vulnerability of health-system infrastructure to climate change. For example, only two of nine responding countries in the African region reported efforts to improve the climate resiliency of health infrastructure. Similar trends were found in other WHO regions. This indicator does not capture the quality or effectiveness of efforts to build climate-resilient health 600	1
Conclusion This section has presented indicators across a range of areas relevant to health adaptation and resilience. The public and the health systems they depend on are clearly unprepared to manage the health impacts of climate change. In many cases, the available data and methods provide only a starting point for an eventual suite of indicators  	1
Section 3: Mitigation, actions, and health co-benefits In previous sections we have covered the health impacts of climate change, the adaptation available and being implemented at present, and the limits to this adaptation.13 In this section, we present a series of indicators relevant to the near-term health co-benefits of climate mitigation policies. Accounting for this enables a more complete consideration of the total costs and benefits of such policies and is essential in maximising the cumulative health benefits of climate change mitigation. The health co-benefits of meeting commitments under the Paris Agreement are potentially immense, reducing the burden of disease for many of the greatest health challenges today and in the future.88 The indicators presented in this section describe a clear and urgent need to increase the scope of mitigation ambition if the world is to keep global average temperatures well below 2C.1 Countries are accelerating their response to climate change, with Finland, the UK, and China making strong commitments to phase-out or dramatically reduce their dependence on coal.89-92 By 2017, electric vehicles are poised to be cost-competitive with their petroleum equivalents, a phenomenon that was not expected until 2030. Globally, more renewable energy capacity is being built every year than all other sources combined.92,93 Consequently, renewable energy is now broadly cost-competitive with fossil fuels, with electricity from low-latitude solar photovoltaic energy being cheaper than natural gas.92-94	1
Tracking the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation Meeting the Paris Agreement will require global greenhouse gas emissions to peak within the next few years and undergo rapid reduction thereafter, implying near-term actions and medium-term and long-term cuts through country-level activities.11 Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry were 36*3 gigatonnes CO2 in 2015 (60% higher than in 1990), whereas emission from land use change, which is intrinsically difficult to estimate, was about 4*8 gigatonnes CO2. In the same year, 41% of the total fossil fuel and industry emissions were estimated to come from coal, 34% from oil, 19% from gas, and 6% from cement.95 In 2015, the largest emitters of CO2 were China (29%), the USA (15%), the European Union's 28 member states (EU28; 10%), and India (6*3%). However, per capita emissions of CO2 belie the disparity driven by consumption, with global mean emissions at 4*8 tonnes CO2 per person per year compared with 16*8 tonnes CO2 in the USA, 7*7 tonnes CO2 in China, 7*0 tonnes CO2 in EU28, and 1*8 tonnes CO2 in India.95  	1
The actions needed to embark on rapid decarbonisation include avoiding the lock-in of carbon-intensive infra structure and energy systems, reducing the cost of scaling-up low-carbon systems, minimising reliance on unproven technologies, and realising opportunities of near-term co-benefits for health, security, and the environment.11 These actions will need to also be costeffective and supported by non-state actors and industry. Indicators in this section are broadly considered within the framework of Driving Force-Pressure-StateExposure-Effect-Action, which is recognised as being suitable for the development of environmental health indicators and for the identification of entry points for policy intervention.96 An adaptation of the framework to examine the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation is explained in the appendix (p 70). Health co-benefit indicators are captured for four sectors: energy, transport, food, and health care. Headline findings for all indicators are provided at the beginning of each indicator; more detailed discussion of the data and methods used is available in the appendix (p 57).	1
Energy supply and demand sectors Fossil fuel burning is the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions wordwide, producing an estimated 72% of all greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities.97,98 66% of these emissions arise in the energy sector from the production of thermal and electric power for consumption in a range of sectors including industry, commercial, residential, and transport sectors. To meet the climate change mitigation ambitions of the Paris Agreement, it is widely accepted that the energy system will need to largely complete the transition towards near zero-carbon emissions by, or soon after, 2050, and then to negative emissions in the latter part of the century.99,100 The necessary action has been framed as a halving of CO2 emissions every decade.101 The potential short-term health benefits of such strategies are substantial, with profound improvements from a reduction in indoor and outdoor air pollution; more equitable access to reliable energy for health facilities and communities; and reduced costs of basic energy services for heating, cooking, and lighting to support an improved quality of life.	1
Indicator 3.1: Carbon intensity of the energy system This indicator reports that globally, the carbon intensity of total primary energy supply (TPES) of 55-56 tonnes CO2/TJ has remained stable since 1990, reflecting the huge global challenge of energy-system decarbonisation. This has occurred because the reduction in carbon intensity in the USA, UK, and Germany has been offset by an increased carbon intensity of energy supply in India and China. To achieve the 2C target (at a 66% probability), the global energy sector must reduce CO2 emissions to more 601	1
than 70% below current levels by 2050. This means a large reduction in the carbon intensity of the global energy system, which can be measured as the tonnes of CO2 for each unit of TPES. TPES reflects the total amount of primary energy used in a specific country, accounting for the flow of energy imports and exports.102 Commitments under the Paris Agreement should begin to lower the overall carbon intensity of TPES, with the aim of reducing to near zero by 2050. Drawing on data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), this indicator shows that since the 1990s, the global carbon intensity of TPES has remained 55-56 tonnes CO2/TJ.103 However, a 53% increase in energy demand during the period has meant that global CO2 emissions have increased substantially. Increased 602	1
coal use in LMICs has driven a rapid increase in carbon intensity since the 1970s (figure 17). For example, India's TPES has almost tripled since 1980, with the share of coal in the energy mix doubling from 22% to 44%. Between 1980 and 2014, a four-fold increase in China's TPES, combined with increasing carbon intensity due to the coal share of TPES increasing from 52% to 66%, has led to strong increase in emissions. High-income countries such as the USA and Germany have reduced carbon intensity since the 1970s (figure 17) by transitioning away from coal in energy production and use, reducing heavy industrial output, and increasing use of lower carbon fuels, notably moving from coal to natural gas in the power sector and increasing the use of renewable energy. This indicator reports that globally, total primary coal supply has increased from 92 EJ in 1990 to 160 EJ in 2015. However, this peaked in 2013 and is now rapidly declining, with the amount of coal power capacity planned for construction halving from 2016 to 2017. The primary means of reducing carbon intensity of the energy system within necessary timescales will be the phase-out of coal. Worldwide, coal supplies 30% of energy use and is the source of 44% of CO2 emissions worldwide. The dirtiest form of coal produces almost twice as much carbon per unit of primary energy than the least carbon-intensive fossil fuel (natural gas).103 Given that a large share of coal is used for power generation, it is an important sector of focus, both to reduce CO2 emissions and to mitigate a major source of air pollution.103 This indicator of coal phase-out is the total primary coal supply in the energy system (figure 18), which makes use of recent data from the IEA.103 Coal use worldwide has increased by just less than 60% since 1990. This is due to strong increases in global energy demand and an increasing share of TPES coming from coal, having increased from 26% in 1990 to 29% in 2014.103 This worldwide increase in coal use has largely been driven by China's increasing use of coal in industry and electricity production, particularly in the 2000s (figure 18). Crucially, coal use in China has plateaued and reduced since 2013, in large part because the health effects of air pollution have been recognised, slower growth and structural changes in China's economy, and a slowing in energy sector expansion.104 India has also seen substantial growth in coal use, with the share of coal in TPES increasing from 31% in 1990 to 46% in 2015. The other large coal-consuming regions are the USA and Europe. Consumption has been stable in the USA since the 1990s, but use has recently decreased, particularly in energy production and use, because of the costcompetitiveness of shale gas. Coal use in Europe has been steadily decreasing since the 1990s, again through a move to gas in economies such as the UK, although this  	1
overall downward trend has transitioned to a plateau in recent years. China and India have similar shares of electricity generated by coal, at about 75% of total electricity generation. The plateauing coal use in China has not been observed in other parts of Asia, and the rapidly emerging economies of Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines see strong growth from coal.103 Meeting the IEA's 2C pathway and the Paris Agreement requires that no new coal-fired plants be built (beyond those with construction already underway), with a complete phase-out of unabated plants (not fitted with carbon capture and storage) by 2040. Crucially, such a transition might have started, with the amount of coal power capacity in preconstruction planning at 570 gigawatts in January, 2017, compared with 1090 gigawatts in January, 2016.105 A range of reasons for this large reduction include decreasing planned capacity expansion, a desire to tackle air pollution, and active efforts to expand renewable investment.	1
represents the beginning of reductions in morbidity and mortality from air pollution, and a potentially remarkable success for global health. As coal is phased out of the energy system, particularly from electricity production, the rapid scale up of zerocarbon energy production and use will be crucial. To remain on a 2C pathway, renewables-based capacity additions will need to be sustained during the next 35 years, reaching 400 gigawatts per year by 2050, which is 2*5 times the current level. Solar, wind, and hydroelectric renewable technologies will be important for achieving this goal. Indicator 3.3 draws on IEA data and considers both renewable and zero-carbon electricity.103 Conversely, renewable energy refers to "all forms of energy produced from renewable sources in a sustainable manner, which include: bioenergy, geothermal, hydropower, ocean energy (tidal, wave, thermal), solar energy and wind energy".106 By comparison, zero-carbon energy means no greenhouse gas emissions (ie, zero-carbon and carbon equivalent) at the point of energy production and use, which therefore also includes nuclear-powered electricity but excludes biomass. Both renewable and zero-carbon electricity displace the use of fossil fuels, reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and so are important indicators for climate change and for health. One caveat is that combustion of solid biomass fuels such as wood, which is occassionally promoted for climate change mitigation purposes, might increase PM2*5 exposure and not be carbon-neutral.107 603	1
Panel 7: Energy and household air pollution in Peru Universal access to energy is a major challenge in most low-income and middle-income countries, and access to clean energy or energy sources that do not adversely affect health is a considerable problem. In Peru, low-income families spend a higher percentage (5-18%) of average monthly income on energy services than families with higher incomes.83 Furthermore, more than 80% of Peru's rural population use firewood, dung, or coal for cooking, making indoor air pollution one of the main environmental risk factors.84 Since the 1990s, the Peruvian Government and various non-governmental organisations have promoted programmes and policies oriented towards addressing the problem of solid fuels for lighting, cooking, and heating and the inadequate access to energy sources in low-income sectors. In 2009, legislative changes enabled subnational governments to invest up to 2*5% of the national mining revenues in improved cook stove (ICS) deployment, resulting in the installation of more than 280 000 ICSs nationwide (52% public and 43% private) as part of the multisectorial campaign Half Million ICS For A Smokeless Peru. This campaign aims to improve quality of life and health through the instalment of certified ICSs. Studies show that a well kept and certified ICS can reduce personal exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2*5). Peru released its 2010-40 National Energy Policy in 2010. Of the nine goals, two discuss access to energy services to low-income sectors. Special programmes have been developed in rural, high-altitude, and Amazonian regions of Peru to address energy access issues. In 2012, programmes were established to substitute kerosene and other contaminating stoves with liquefied petroleum gas and ICS; and the Social Inclusion Energy Fund was established, promoting access to liquefied petroleum gas for the most vulnerable populations through subsidies. According to the Social Inclusion Energy Fund, more than 1*3 million families had received a liquefied petroleum gas stove by 2015, mitigating 91% of their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and leading to a corresponding reduction of 553 000 tonnes of CO2 by using cleaner sources of energy.85,86	1
As a share of total generation, renewable energy has increased by more than 20% between 1990 and 2013. The renewable energy sector continues to grow rapidly, mainly from increasing wind and solar photovoltaic investment, most notably in the USA, China, and Europe (figure 19). In 2015, more renewable energy capacity (150 gigawatts) was added than fossil fuel capacity globally. Overall, there is now more added	1
Indicator 3.4: Access to clean energy This indicator reports that in 2016, 1*2 billion people did not have access to electricity, and 2*7 billion people relied on burning unsafe, unsustainable, and inefficient solid fuels. Increased access to clean fuels and clean energy technologies will have the dual benefit of reducing indoor air pollution exposure and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by displacing fossil fuels.108 Use of clean energy for heating, cooling, cooking, and lighting is important for improving health and wellbeing, economic productivity, and reducing the risk of harm from living in energy poverty.109 An estimated 1*2 billion people worldwide do not have access to electricity, and 2*7 billion people rely on burning unsustainable and inefficient solid fuels (panel 7). According to the World Energy Outlook Biomass Database and Electricity Access Database, the reduced indoor air quality from burning these fuels is estimated to cause 4*3 million premature deaths related to pneumonia, stroke, lung cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease each year. Access to electricity, an energy source that emits no direct airborne particles (although particles might be emitted indirectly from the fuel used to generate the electrical power), is currently 85*3% worldwide but varies widely between countries and between urban and rural settings. This indicator draws on and aligns with the proposed Sustainable Development Goal Indicator 7.1.2, which defines clean energy in terms of the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (ie, against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the WHO normative guidance.110 The indicator also estimates the proportion of the population that primarily relies on clean fuels (including liquefied petroleum gas, a fossil fuel that is cleaner than many solid fuels) and technologies for cooking, heating, and lighting relative to all people accessing those services. The estimates of fuel use for this indicator come from WHO household survey data (roughly 800 nationally representative surveys and censuses) that are modelled to estimate the proportion of households' reliance on clean fuels (figure 20).111	1
Indicator 3.5: Exposure to ambient air pollution This indicator reports that 71% of the 2971 cities in WHO's database do not satisfy WHO annual fine particulate matter exposure recommendations. Air pollutants directly harmful to health are emitted by combustion processes that also contribute to emissions of greenhouse gas. As such, well designed actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will improve ambient  	1
air quality and have associated benefits for human wellbeing.112 Estimates suggest that global populationweighted PM2*5 exposure has increased by 11*2% since 1990.112,113 To represent levels of exposure to air pollution, this indicator collects information on annual average urban background concentrations of PM2.5 in urban settings across the world.	1
Indicator 3.5.1: Exposure to air pollution in cities The data for this indicator were extracted from WHO's Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database,114 which compiles information from a range of public sources, including national and subnational reports and websites, regional 606	1
networks, intergovernmental agencies, and academic articles. The air pollution measurements are taken from monitoring stations in urban background, residential, commercial, and mixed areas. The annual average density of emission sources in urban areas and the proximity of populations to those sources led us to focus on exposure in cities. For this indicator, we combined the WHO Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database with the Sustainable Healthy Urban Environments database,115 presenting data on 246 randomly sampled cities across the world (stratified by national wealth, population size, and Bailey's Ecoregion).  	1
Figure 24: Health impacts of exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2*5) in south and east Asian countries in 2015, by key sources of pollution The contributions of individual source sectors to ambient PM2*5 concentrations have been calculated using linearised relationships based on full atmospheric chemistry transport model simulations, and premature deaths are calculated following the methodology used by WHO and the Global Burden of Disease 2013 study.	1
PM2*5 concentrations in most cities are well above the WHO's annual guideline of 10 g/m, with particularly high concentrations in cities in central, south, and east Asia (figure 21). PM2*5 concentrations exceed the guideline concentration in 71*2% of the nearly 3000 cities in the WHO database. However, since monitoring is more common in high-income settings, this is probably an underestimate. 87*3% of randomly selected cities in the Sustainable Healthy Urban Environments database had PM2*5 concentrations that exceeded recommended concentrations. The data suggest that air pollution has generally decreased in high-income settings in recent decades but has marginally increased worldwide.116	1
transport sector was responsible for around half of all energy-related NOx emissions.103 30% of PM2*5 emissions in 2015 came from the manufacturing industry, and 10% of PM2*5 emissions came from the transport sector (figure 23A).103 Within the transport sector, road vehicles were by far the largest source of NOx and PM2*5 emissions (58% and 73%, respectively), whereas the largest source of SO2 emissions was shipping.103 There are marked regional differences in trends of NOx emissions within the transport sector. As car ownership has increased between 1990 and 2010, the USA, EU, and Japan have decreased NOx emissions, whereas China and southeast Asia have increased NOx emissions from transport (figure 23B).	1
The energy sector (both production and use) is the single largest source of man-made air pollution emissions, producing 85% of particulate matter and almost all of the SO2 and NOx emitted worldwide (figure 22).103 Coal power is responsible for three-quarters of the energy sector's sulpher dioxide (SO2) emissions, 70% of nitric oxide (NOx) emissions, and more than 90% of PM2.5 emissions.103 However, in the past decade, these emissions have largely decoupled from increases in coal-fired generation in several geographies because emission standards have been introduced for coal power plants.117,118 In 2015, manufacturing and other industries (eg, refining and mining) were responsible for about half of global energy-related SO2 emissions and 30% of energyrelated NOx emissions (28 megatonnes), whereas the  	1
The extent to which emissions of different pollutants from different sectors contribute to ambient PM2*5 con centrations depends on atmospheric processes such as the dispersion of primary particles and the formation of secondary aerosols from precursor emissions. Sources with low stack heights that are located close to populations (eg, household combustion for cooking and heating, road vehicles) typically have a disproportionally larger role for total population exposure in relation to their absolute emissions. Long-term exposure to ambient PM2*5 is associated with increased mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases.119-121 WHO estimated that ambient air pollution causes about 3 million premature deaths worldwide every year.122 The sources of air pollution and greenhouse gases are overlapping in many cases, so 607	1
greenhouse gas mitigation measures can have large co-benefits for human health. We estimated premature mortality from ambient air pollution, as calculated in the GAINS model and using data from the IEA, for south and east Asian countries in 2015 (figure 24).123 The contributions of individual source sectors to ambient PM2*5 concentrations were calculated using linearised relationships based on full 608	1
atmospheric chemistry transport model simulations, and premature deaths were calculated following the methodology used by WHO and in the GBD 2013 study.121,122 In some countries such as China, North Korea, and South Korea, agriculture is a large contributor to premature deaths. Large direct benefits for human health can therefore be expected if these emission sources are addressed by climate policies. For example, additional important benefits could also become available if coal-fired power plants were replaced by wind and solar. Replacement of household combustion of coal in China would result in health benefits not only from ambient (outdoor) but also household (indoor) exposure to air pollution. Transport sector Transportation systems (including road vehicles, rail, shipping, and aviation) are key sources of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to 14% of global emissions in 2010.102,103 To meet the 2C target, the transport sector must reduce its total greenhouse gas emissions more than 20% below current levels by 2050 and be on a trajectory to zerocarbon emissions in the second half of the century.124 Compared with other energy-demand sectors, key subsectors of transportation (urban personal and freight transport, long-distance road transport, shipping, shorthaul aviation, and long-haul aviation) are difficult to decarbonise because of the high-energy density of fossil fuels, so emission reduction targets are lower for transport than for the energy sector as a whole. The transport sector is also a major source of air pollutants, including particulate matter, NOx, SO2, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and, indirectly, ozone. Furthermore, exposure to air pollution from road transport is particularly challenging in cities where vehicles emit street-level air pollution. In turn, important opportunities for health exist through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from transport systems, both in the near term through cleaner air and increased physical activity, and in the long-term through the mitigation of climate change.	1
Indicator 3.6: Clean fuel for transport This indicator reports that transport fuel use on a percapita basis has increased worldwide by almost 24% since 1990. Although petrol and diesel continue to dominate, use of non-conventional fuels has been rapidly expanding, with more than 2 million electric vehicles sold between 2010 and 2016. Fuels for transport produce more than half the NOx and a substantial proportion of particulate matter emitted worldwide.102,103 Switching to low-emission transport systems is an important component of climate change mitigation and will help reduce concentrations of most ambient air pollutants. How ever, the transport sector's extremely high reliance on petroleum-based fuels makes this transition particularly challenging.  	1
This indicator focuses on monitoring global trends in fuel efficiency and on the transition away from the most polluting and carbon-intensive transport fuels. More specifically, this indicator follows the metric of fuel use for transportation on a per-capita basis, by type of fuel. To develop this indicator, we drew on transport fuel data from the IEA and population data from the World Bank.103 Although some transport types have transitioned away from carbon-intensive fuel use and fuel efficiency has improved in select countries, transport is still heavily dominated by gasoline and diesel. Transport fuel use on a per-capita basis has increased worldwide by almost 65% since 1970 (figure 25). However, non-conventional fuels (eg, electricity, biofuels, and natural gas) have been rapidly gaining traction since the 2000s, with more than 2 million electric vehicles sold since 2010, mostly in the USA, China, Japan, and some European countries (figure 26).125 These figures are modest compared with the overall sales of cars per year (77 million in 2017) and the total global fleet of 1*2 billion cars.	1
Indicator 3.7: Sustainable travel infrastructure and uptake This indicator reports that levels of sustainable travel appear to be increasing in many European cities, but cities in emerging economies are facing sustainable mobility challenges. Although levels of private transport use remain high in many cities in the USA and Australia, evidence suggests that they are beginning to decrease. Global trends of population growth and increasing urbanisation suggest that demand for mobility in urban areas will increase. Moving from private motorised transport to more sustainable modes of travel (public transport, walking, and cycling) in urban areas not only  	1
helps to reduce emissions from vehicles but also has several health co-benefits. This indicator tracks trends in sustainable travel infrastructure and uptake in urban areas. Although this indicator would ideally track the proportion and distance of journeys undertaken by different modes of transport over time, data for citylevel trends in modal share are particularly scarce. We therefore present data for selected locations, across a limited timescale. Modal shares (ie, estimates of the proportion of trips by different modes of transport in recent years) in world cities are shown in figure 27 (details in appendix, p 64). The data, collated by the Land Transport Authority, come from travel surveys of individual cities and national census data (appendix p 64).127 We collated data on trends in modal share in select cities, for which data from at least three timepoints (including one pre-2000 timepoint) are available. Although many cities have begun collecting this information in the past decade, there is a paucity of data on trends from before 2000, with particularly wide gaps in data availability from cities in Asia, Africa, and South America.138 In Berlin, London, and Tokyo, the proportion of trips by privatised motor transport has slowly decreased since the late 1990s, whereas levels have remained high in Vancouver and Sydney and appear to be increasing in Santiago (figure 28). Levels of cycling are generally low but appear to be increasing in many cities. Public transport in emerging cities is often in sufficient, inefficient, and in poor condition, potentially leading to further decreases in sustainable travel in 609	1
Figure 28: Trends in modal share in selected cities Data from Santiago in 1991 represents travel on a usual day.128 Data from Sydney represent weekdays only, and the cycling modal share in Sydney is less than 1%.129-132 Sources: Institute for Mobility Research (2016),133 Transport for London (2016),134 New South Wales Department of Transport (2003, 2009, 2017),129-132 MetroVancouver Translink (2012),135 and the SECTRA Road and Transport Program (1992),128 Rode et al (2015),136 and City of Berlin.137	1
many rapidly growing cities in the future.139 As this transition occurs, ensuring the mistakes made in countries within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are not repeated will be essential. In particular, it is crucial to improve 610	1
walking and cycling environments so these become attractive modes of choice and protect road users from injury. The UN recommends devoting 20% of transport budgets to funding non-motorised transport at national and local levels in LMICs.140  	1
Indicator 3.8: Ruminant meat for human consumption This indicator reports that the amount of ruminant meat available for human consumption worldwide has decreased slightly from 12*09 kg/capita per year in 1990, to 11*23 kg/capita per year in 2013. The proportion of energy (kcal/capita per day) available for human consumption from ruminant meat, as opposed to other sources, has decreased marginally from 1*86% in 1990 to 1*65% in 2013. This indicator focuses on ruminants because the production of ruminant meat, from cattle in particular, dominates greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector (estimated at 5*6-7*5 gigatonnes emitted CO2 per year). Consumption of red meat also has known associations with adverse health outcomes.147 This indicator measures the total amount of ruminant meat available for consumption and the ratio of ruminant meat energy supply to total energy supply. Together, these data reflect the relative amount of foods in the system that have high greenhouse gas emissions (figure 29).148-150 Assuming correlation between ruminant meat supply and consumption, the indicator therefore also provides information about variations in certain diet-related health outcomes (such as colorectal cancer and heart disease).151,152 This indicator should be viewed in the context of the specific setting where this trend is examined (in some populations, meat consumption is a  	1
The availability of food is central to human health. Its production, however, is also a major contributor to climate change, with the agricultural sector alone contributing 19-29% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.13,141 Dietary choices determine food energy and nutrient intake. Inadequate and unhealthy diets are associated with malnutrition and adverse health outcomes including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and some cancers. Dietary risk factors were estimated to account for more than 10% of all disability-adjusted life-years lost in 2013.142 A transition to healthier diets, with reduced consumption of red meat and processed meat and increased consumption of locally and seasonally produced fruits and vegetables, could provide substantial emissions savings.143 Tracking progress towards more sustainable diets requires consistent and continuous data on food consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions throughout food product life cycles. This would require annual nationally representative dietary survey data on food consumption. However, due to the complexity and cost of such data collection, dietary surveys are available for a limited number of countries and years only.144 Efforts to compile data and ensure comparability are underway, but their current format is not suitable for global monitoring of progress towards optimal dietary patterns.145,146	1
main source of food energy, provides essential micronutrients, and sustains livelihoods). Data for this indicator were constructed from the FAOSTAT food balance sheets, which comprise national supply and utilisation accounts of primary foods and processed commodities. The amount of ruminant meat available for consumption is high in the Americas and has remained relatively stable between 1990 and 2013. In Europe, the amount of ruminant meat was relatively high in 1990 but decreased rapidly from 1990-2000 and has remained stable from 2000-13. By comparison, amounts of ruminant meat available are moderate in Africa and the eastern Mediterranean and have remained reasonably constant over time. Southeast Asia and the western Pacific have low amounts of	1
responsibility and an appreciable opportunity to lead by example in reducing its carbon footprint. In 2013, the estimated US health-care sector emissions were 655 megatonnes CO2, which exceeded CO2 emissions in the UK.154 Greenhouse gas emission in the health-care sector is an obvious externality that contributes to climate change, contradicting the sector's aim of improving population health. The World Bank estimates that a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions from health-care sectors in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Nepal, Philippines, and South Africa would equate to 116-194 million tonne reduction in CO2 emission (the equivalent of decommissioning 34-56 coal-fired power plants or removing 24-41 million passenger vehicles from the road).154	1
ruminant meat available, but availability has been slowly increasing in the western Pacific since 1990. The proportion of energy supply from ruminant meat has been markedly higher in the Americas than in other regions since the 1990s, although the trend has been decreasing over time (figure 30). In Europe, the proportion of energy from ruminant meat rapidly decreased from 1990 to 2000 and has continued to slowly decrease. By contrast, the trend in energy supply from ruminant meat has been increasing in the western Pacific, possibly reflecting the increasing trend in beef consumption in China (16% increase annually).153	1
No systematic global standard for measuring the greenhouse gas emissions of the health-care sector exist, but a number of health-care systems in the UK, the USA, and around the world are working to reduce their contribution to climate change. Several reduction targets in the health-care sector can be highlighted as positive examples. The UK's National Health Service (NHS) set an ambitious target of a 34% reduction in health-system-wide greenhouse gas emission by 2020. Kaiser Permanente in the USA has set 2025 as a target to become net carbon positive. The Western Cape Government health system in South Africa has committed to a 10% emission reduction by 2020 and a 30% reduction by 2050 in government hospitals. The Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil, has reduced its annual emissions by 41%.154 In the UK, comprehensive reporting of greenhouse gas emissions was facilitated by the centralised structure of the NHS. The Sustainable Development Unit of the NHS has been monitoring greenhouse gas emissions from a 1992 baseline, including major contributions from procurement of pharmaceuticals and other products. NHS greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 11% between 2007 and 2015, despite an 18% increase in activity.155 Mitigation efforts from the health-care sector provide remarkable examples of hospitals and health-care systems leading by example, yielding impressive financial savings and health benefits for their patients. To this end, the efforts of the hospitals, governments, and civil society organisations driving this work forward must be supported and redoubled to ensure a full transition to a healthier, more sustainable model of climate-smart and increasingly carbon-neutral health care.154 Monitoring health-care system emissions is an essential step towards accounting for the externality of these emissions. Comprehensive reporting of national greenhouse gas emissions by the health-care system is only routinely done in the UK. Elsewhere, select healthcare organisations, facilities, and companies provide  	1
self-reported estimates of emissions, but this reporting is rarely standardised across sites. We will continue our work on developing a standardised indicator on healthcare sector emissions for future reports.	1
Section 4: Finance and economics Interventions to protect human health from climate change have been presented above. In this section, we focus on the economic and financial mechanisms necessary for these interventions to be implemented and their implications. Some of the indicators do not have an explicit link to human health, and yet increasing investment in renewable energy and decreasing investment in coal capacity, for instance, are essential in displacing fossil fuels and reducing their two principal externalities: the social cost of climate change and the health costs from air pollution. Other indicators, such as economic and social losses from extreme weather events, have more explicit links to human wellbeing. In the 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change,156 the impacts of climate change were estimated to cost the equivalent of reducing annual global gross world product (GWP; the sum of global economic output) by "5-20% now, and forever", compared with a world without climate change. In their Fifth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates an aggregate loss of up to 2% of GWP even if the rise in global mean temperatures is limited to 2*5C above pre-industrial levels.22 However, such estimates depend on numerous assumptions such as the rate at which future costs and benefits are discounted. Furthermore, existing analytical approaches are poorly suited to producing estimates of the economic impact of climate change, and hence their magnitude is probably greatly underestimated.157,158 In view of such uncertainty, with potentially catastrophic outcomes, risk minimisation through stringent emission reduction seems the sensible course of action.  	1
The indicators presented in this section have provided an overview of activities in energy, transport, food, and health-care sectors that are relevant to mitigating the effects of climate change on public health. They have been selected for their relevance to both climate change and human health and wellbeing. A number of areas show remarkable promise, each of which should yield impressive benefits for human health. However, these positive examples must not distract from the enormity of the task at hand. The indicators presented in this section serve as a reminder of the scale and scope of increased ambition required to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement. They demonstrate a world that is only just beginning to respond to climate change and hence only just unlocking the opportunities available for better health.	1
The ten indicators in this section seek to track flows of finance and impacts on the economy and social welfare resulting from action (and inaction) on climate change. These indicators fall into four broad themes: investing in a low-carbon economy; the economic benefits of tackling climate change; pricing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels; and adaptation financing. Headline findings for all indicators are provided at the beginning of each indicator; additional detailed disussion of the data and methods used is available in the appendix (p 73).	1
Indicator 4.1: Investments in zero-carbon energy and energy efficiency This indicator reports that proportional investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency increased in 2016, whereas absolute and proportional investment in fossil fuels decreased and, crucially, ceased to account for most annual investments in the global energy system. This indicator tracks the level of global investment in zero-carbon energy and energy efficiency in absolute terms and as a proportion of total energy-system investment. In 2015, total investment in the energy system was around $1*83 trillion (in US$2016), accounting for 2*4% of GWP (figure 31).159,160 19% of this investment went to renewables and nuclear energy, and 12% of this investment was for energy efficiency. Most investment (54%) was in fossil fuel infrastructure. Electricity networks accounted for the remaining 15%. In 2016, total investment in the energy system reduced to around $1*68 trillion, accounting for 2*2% of GWP. Although the absolute value of investment in renewables and nuclear energy reduced slightly in absolute (real) terms, its proportional contribution increased to 20% of total investment. Investment in energy efficiency 613	1
To hold a 66% probability of remaining within 2C of global warming, average annual investments in the energy system must reach $3*5 trillion between 2016 and 2050, with renewable energy investments increasing by more than 150% and energy efficiency increasing by around a factor of ten.162	1
increased in both absolute and proportional terms to 14% of total investment. Fossil fuel infrastructure suffered a substantial reduction in investment, ceasing to account for the majority of investment (at 49%). Such trends broadly represent a continuation of the trends seen between 2014 and 2015.161 Investment in renewables and nuclear energy is driven by renewable electricity capacity (with more than 87% of investment by value in this category in 2016). This, in turn, is largely driven by investments in solar photovoltaic power and onshore wind. Solar photovoltaic capacity additions in 2016 were 50% higher than in 2015 (reaching a record high of 73 gigawatts). This development was driven by new capacity in China, the USA, and India, but it was coupled with just a 20% increase in investment that resulted from a 20% reduction in the cost of solar photovoltaic units. By contrast, investments in onshore wind decreased by around 20% between 2015 and 2016, largely because of changes to incentive schemes and increased wind power curtailment rates in China. The increase in energy efficiency investment was driven by policies that shifted markets towards more energyefficient goods (eg, appliances and lighting) and buildings (along with the expansion of the construction industry) and an increase in the sales of energy-efficient (and low-carbon) vehicles. Europe accounted for the largest proportion of spending on energy efficiency (30%), followed by China (27%). This change in spending was driven by efficiency investments in the buildings and transport sectors.160 The substantially reduced investment in fossil fuel infrastructure, both upstream (eg, mining, drilling, and pipelines, which dominate fossil fuel investment) and downstream (eg, fossil fuel power plants), is driven by a combination of low (and decreasing) fossil fuel prices and cost reductions (particularly upstream, which have on average decreased by 30% since 2014).160 614	1
This indicator reports that, although investment in coal capacity has increased since 2006, in 2016 this trend turned and investment has decreased substantially. Coal combustion is the most CO2-intensive method of generating of electricity.163 This indicator tracks annual investment in coal-fired power capacity. Global investment in coal-fired electricity capacity generally increased from 2006 to 2012, before returning to 2006 levels in 2013-14 and rebounding to more than 40% above this level in 2015 (figure 32). This rapid growth was driven principally by China, which increased investment in coal-fired power capacity by 60% from 2014, representing half of all new global coal capacity in 2015 (with investment in India and other Asian nonOECD countries also remaining high).161 The subsequent reduction in investment in 2016 was similarly driven by reduced investment in China because of overcapacity in generation, concerns about local air pollution, and new government measures to reduce new capacity additions and halt the construction of some plants already in progress.160	1
Indicator 4.3: Funds divested from fossil fuels This indicator reports that the Global Value of Funds Committing to Divestment in 2016 was $1*24 trillion, of which Health Institutions was $2*4 billion; this represents a cumulative sum of $5*45 trillion (with health accounting for $30*3 billion). The fossil fuel divestment movement seeks to encourage institutions and investors to divest themselves of assets involved in the extraction of fossil fuels. Some organisations have made a binding commitment to divest from coal companies, whereas others have fully divested from any investments in fossil fuel companies and have committed to avoiding such investments in the future. Proponents cite divestment as embodying both a moral purpose (eg, reducing the fossil fuel industry's socalled social licence to operate) and an economic riskreduction strategy (eg, reducing the investor's exposure to the risk of stranded assets). However, others believe active engagement between investors and fossil fuel businesses is a more appropriate course of action (eg, encouraging diversification into less carbon-intensive assets through stakeholder resolutions).164 This indicator tracks the global total value of funds committing to divestment in 2016 ($1*24 trillion) and the value of funds committed to divestment by health institutions in 2016 ($2*4 billion). The values presented above are calculated from data collected and provided  	1
by 350.org. They represent the total assets (or assets under management) for institutions that have committed to divest in 2016 and thus do not directly represent the sums divested from fossil fuel companies. They also only include those institutions for which such information is publicly available (or provided by the institution itself ), with non-US$ values converted using the market exchange rate when the commitment was made. By the end of 2016, 694 organisations with cumulative assets worth at least $5*45 trillion, including 13 health organisations with assets of at least $30*3 billion, had committed to divestment. From the start of January, 2017, to the end of March, 2017, a further 12 organisations with assets worth $46*87 billion joined this total (including Australia's Hospitals Contribution Fund, with assets of $1*45 billion).	1
Indicator 4.4: Economic losses due to extreme climate-related events This indicator reportst that in 2016, a total of 797 events resulted in $129 billion in overall economic losses, with 99% of losses in low-income countries uninsured. Climate change will continue to increase the frequency and severity of meteorological (tropical storms), climatological (droughts), and hydrological (flooding) phenomena across the world. As demonstrated by indicator 1*4, the number of weatherrelated disasters has increased in recent years. The number of people affected and the economic costs  	1
associated with this increase are expected to have risen. This indicator tracks the number of events and the total economic losses (insured and uninsured) resulting from such events. In addition to the health impacts of these events, economic losses (particularly uninsured losses) have potentially devastating impacts on wellbeing and mental health.165 The data upon which this indicator is based were sourced from Munich Re's NatCatSERVICE. Economic losses (insured and uninsured) refer to the value of physical assets and do not include the economic value of loss of life or ill health, or of health and casualty insurance. Values are first denominated in local currency, converted to US$ using the market exchange rate in the month the event occurred, and inflated to US$2016 using country-specific Consumer Price Indices. This indicator and underlying data do not seek to attribute events and economic losses to climate change per se but might plausibly be interpreted as showing how climate change is changing the frequency and severity of these events. An annual average of 700 events resulted in an annual average of $127 billion in overall economic losses per year between 2010 and 2016 (figure 33). Around two-thirds of the recorded events and around 90% of economic losses were in upper-middle and high-income countries, with less than 1% attributable to low-income countries. The same ratios for the number of events and economic losses between income groups are present in the data for 1990-2016, despite an increasing trend in the	1
total global number of events and associated total value of economic losses during this period. However, the data do not indicate the relative scale of impacts across different income groups. For example, although most economic losses have occurred in upper-middle and high-income countries, these countries are among the most populous, with more economically valuable property and infrastructure (in absolute terms). A rather different picture emerges when data are analysed in terms of intensity (insured and uninsured economic losses per $1000 gross domestic product [GDP]; figure 34). Between 2010 and 2016, high-income and uppermiddle-income countries had the lowest average annual economic loss as a proportion of GDP ($1*45/$1000 GDP and $1*95/$1000 GDP, respectively), with low-income and lower-middle-income countries subject to somewhat higher values ($2*65/$1000 GDP and $2*3/$1000 GDP, respectively). Economic losses in low-income countries were more than three times higher in 2016 than in 2010. However, for the period 1990-2016, average annual values vary substantially (full dataset included in the appendix p 77). Although high-income and upper-middle income countries maintain relatively similar values ($1*60/$1000 GDP and $2*9/$1000 GDP, respectively), average annual economic losses in low-income and lowermiddle income countries increase substantially (to $10*95/$1000 GDP and $4*22/$1000 GDP, respectively). On average, economic loss as a proportion of GDP is greater in low-income countries than in high-income countries. However, a more striking result is the 616	1
difference in the proportion of economic losses that are uninsured. In high-income countries, on average around half of economic losses experienced are insured. This share drops rapidly to less than 10% in upper-middle income countries, and to much less than 1% in low-income countries. From 1990 to 2016, uninsured losses in low-income countries were on average equivalent to more than 1*5% of their GDP. By contrast, according to Global Health Observatory data, expenditure on health care in low-income countries on average for the period 1995-2015 was equivalent to 5*3% of GDP.	1
Indicator 4.5: Employment in low-carbon and high-carbon industries This indicator reports that in 2016, global employment in renewable energy reached 9*8 million people, with employment in fossil fuel extraction trending downwards to 8*6 million people. The generation and presence of employment oppor tunities in low-carbon and high-carbon industries have important health implications, both in terms of the safety of the work environment itself and financial security for individuals and communities. As the low-carbon transition gathers pace, high-carbon industries and jobs will decline. A clear example is seen in fossil fuel extraction. Some fossil fuel extraction activities, such as coal mining, have substantial impacts on human health. In 2008, coal mining accidents led to more than 1000 deaths in China alone (a rapid decrease from nearly 5000 deaths in 2003), with exposure to particulate matter and harmful pollutants responsible for elevated incidence  	1
Indicator 4.6: Fossil fuel subsidies This indicator reports that in 2015, fossil fuel consumption subsidies followed a trend seen since 2012, decreasing markedly to $327 billion principally as a result of decreasing global oil prices. The combustion of fossil fuels results in a variety of harmful consequences for human health. Subsidies for fossil fuels, either for its production (such as fossil fuel extraction) or consumption (such as regulated gasoline prices), artificially lowers prices and promotes over consumption. This indicator tracks the global value of fossil fuel consumption subsidies (figure 36).161,173 Fossil fuel consumption subsidies, despite increasing from $444 billion in 2010 to a peak of $571 billion in 2012, have decreased markedly to $327 billion in 2015 (in US$2016). The principal driver for this is the doubling in oil price between 2010 and 2012, after which it plateaued, before falling rapidly to below 2010 levels from mid-2014. Fossil fuel consumption subsidies are typically applied to moderate energy costs for low-income consumers (although in practice, 65% of such subsidies in LMICs benefit the wealthiest 40% of the population).174 As such, increasing oil (and other fossil fuel) prices tend to increase subsidy levels as the differences between market and regulated consumer prices increase, and  	1
of cardiovascular, respiratory, and kidney disease in coal mining areas.166-169 The low-carbon transition is also likely to stimulate the growth of new industries and employment opportunities. With appropriate planning and policy, the transition from employment in highcarbon to low-carbon industries will yield positive consequences for human health. This indicator tracks global employment levels in fossil fuel extraction industries (coal mining and oil and gas exploration and production) and in renewable energy (figure 35). The data for this indicator are sourced from International Renewable Energy Agency (renewables) and IBIS World (fossil fuel extraction).170-172 The number of jobs in the global fossil fuel extraction industry decreased from a peak of 9*1 million jobs in 2014 to 8*6 million in 2016. This change was largely driven by reductions in the coal mining industry, which were the result of a range of factors, including its substitution by cheaper natural gas in the power sector in many countries, reducing the demand for coal and leading to overcapacity, industry consolidation, and the rising automation of extractive activities.172 By contrast, employment in the renewable energy industry increased rapidly from more than 7*1 million jobs in 2012 to more than 9*3 million in 2014, reaching 9*8 million in 2016. This growth has largely been driven by the solar photovoltaic industry, which opened more than 1*7 million jobs between 2012 and 2016. Solar photovoltaic energy is now the largest renewable energy employer, overtaking the bioenergy sector, which has seen a reduction of 250 000 jobs since 2012.	1
governments take further action to mitigate the impact on citizens. When fossil fuel prices are reduced, the gap between market and regulated prices decreases, and governments can reform fossil fuel subsidies while keeping overall prices relatively constant. Between 2014 and 2015, several countries took advantage of this opportunity, particularly regarding oil-based fuels, which accounted for more than 60% of the reduction in total fossil fuel subsidies between 2012 and 2015 (followed by natural gas at around 25%). These countries included India, which in deregulating diesel prices accounted for a $19 billion subsidy reduction between 2014 and 2015 (about 13% of the global total reduction), and the largest oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries (including Angola, Algeria, 617	1
Indonesia, Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela), in which reduced hydrocarbon revenue created pressure for fiscal consolidation and, in turn, consumption subsidy reform.161 To encourage the low-carbon transition, fossil fuel subsidies should be phased out as soon as possible. The commitment made by the G7 in 2016 to achieve this goal by 2025 should be extended to all OECD counties and to all countries worldwide by 2030.175	1
Indicator 4.7: Coverage and strength of carbon pricing This indicator reports that so far in 2017, various carbon pricing mechanisms covered 13*1% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, up from 12*1% in 2016. This reflects a doubling in the number of national and subnational jurisdictions with a carbon pricing mechanism over the past decade.	1

This indicator tracks the extent to which carbon pricing instruments (eg, The World Bank's Carbon Pricing Dashboard) are applied around the world as a proportion of total greenhouse gas emissions, and the weighted average carbon price such instruments provide (table 2). Between 2016 and 2017, the proportion of global emissions covered by carbon pricing instruments and the weighted average price of these instruments (and thus the global weighted average price for all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions) increased. This increase followed the introduction of four new instruments in 2017 (this data runs up to April 1, 2017): the carbon taxes in Alberta, Chile, and Colombia, and an Emissions Trading System (ETS) in Ontario. As such, over 40 national and 25 subnational jurisdictions now put a price on at least some of their greenhouse gas emissions (with substantially varying prices, from less than $1 per tonne emitted CO2 in Chongqing to more than $126 per tonne emitted CO2 in Sweden). The past decade has seen a rapid increase in the number of carbon pricing instruments around the world, with a doubling in the number of jurisdictions introducing them.176 More than 75% of the greenhouse gas emissions covered by carbon pricing instruments are in high-income countries, with most of the remainder covered by the eight pilot pricing instruments in China (figure 37).

RGGI=Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Adapted from the Carbon Pricing Watch 2017,176 by permission of the World Bank.	1
An additional 21 carbon pricing instruments are either scheduled for implementation or are under consideration. This includes the commencement of a national ETS in China in the second half of 2017. Although a national ETS would replace the eight pilot schemes already in place in China, it could expand their emissions coverage four-fold, surpassing the European ETS to become the largest carbon pricing instrument in the world.176	1
Indicator 4.8: Use of carbon pricing revenues This indicator reports that 40% of government revenues generated from carbon pricing are spent on climate change mitigation, totalling $9 billion. Carbon pricing instruments require those responsible for producing the emissions to pay for their emissions. In most cases, this generates revenue for the governments or authorities responsible for introducing the instrument. Such revenue may be put to a range of uses. For example, revenue could be invested in climate change mitigation or adaptation or put towards environmental tax reform (ETR), which involves shifting the burden of tax from negative activities (eg, the generation of pollution) to positive activities (eg, labour or environmentally beneficial products or activities). Such options could produce a double dividend of environmental improvement with social and economic benefits.177 This indicator tracks the total government revenue from carbon pricing instruments and how such income is allocated. The total government revenue generated by carbon pricing instruments in 2016, and four categories of expenditure for this revenue are presented in table 3. The largest expenditure category is climate change mitigation, which is in receipt of more than $9 billion in funds annually. Nevertheless, less than half of revenuegenerating instruments allocate revenue for mitigation. ETR policies accounted for around 20% of revenue allocation in 2016. Just two instruments (the Portuguese and British Colombia Carbon Taxes) allocate all their revenue to allowing revenue-neutral reduction in other taxes (eg, income taxes), with another four allocating part of their revenue to this purpose. By contrast, only four instruments do not have any revenue allocated to general government funds (the British Colombian, Swiss, Japanese, and Portuguese carbon taxes), and 11 instruments allocate all revenues to this category (reaching 8 billion, or more than a third of revenues generated in 2016). Data for individual carbon pricing instruments are provided in the appendix (p 88). Data on revenue generated are provided on the World Bank's Carbon Pricing Dashboard, with revenue allocation information obtained from various sources (appendix p 89). We considered only instruments with revenue estimates and with revenue received by the administering authority before redistribution. Revenue must be explicitly allocated to climate change mitigation  	1
or adaptation, or for ETR, to be considered in these categories. If such explicit earmarking is not present, or no data are available, then we assumed revenue to be allocated to general funds.	1
Indicator 4.9: Spending on adaptation for health and health-related activities This indicator reports that only 4*63% of the world's total adaptation spending ($16*46 billion) is on health and 13*3% ($47*29 billion) is on health-related adaptation. This indicator reports estimates of spending on health and health-related climate change adaptation and resilience. Many adaptation activities within and beyond the formal health sector have health co-benefits that are important to understand and capture. Here, estimates of the total health and health-related adaptation spending were derived from the Adaptation & Resilience to Climate Change dataset produced by kMatrix. This global dataset, covering financial transactions relevant to climate change adaptation, was compiled from a relevant subset of more than 27 000 independent databases and sources (such as public disclosures and reports from insurance companies, the financial sector, and governments).178 In this case, entries were triangulated between at least seven independent sources before being included. Examples of transactions captured here include the procurement of goods or services (eg, purchasing sandbags for flood levees) and spending on research and development (eg, for vulnerability and adaptation assessments) or staff training.178 Each of these adaptation activities are grouped into 11 sectors: agriculture and forestry, built environment, disaster-preparedness, energy, health, information and communications technology, natural environment, professional services, transport, waste, and water. Although adaptation spending relevant directly to the formal health sector is clearly important (the health category), interventions outside of the health-care system will also yield important benefits for health and wellbeing. Healthrelated adaptation spending included additional adaptation spending from the agricultural sector (because food and nutrition are central to health) and the disaster preparedness sector (because these efforts often have direct public health benefits). Here we report data from the Adaptation & Resilience to Climate Change dataset, showing health and 619	1
spending. First, spending for agriculture and disaster preparedness was included here, but other forms of adaptation spending clearly have important health implications. Second, only economic data relating to the financial year 2015-16 were available, precluding timetrend analysis. Third, since public sector transactions might not leave a sufficient footprint to be picked up by this methodology, adaptation spending data here might exclude some public-sector spending.	1

health-related adaptation spending for 180 countries for the 2015-16 financial year. Global health adaptation spending for the financial year 2015-16 totalled $16*46 billion, representing 4*63% of the global aggregate adaptation spend. Health-related adaptation spending totalled $47*29 billion, or 13*3% of the global total adaptation spend (figure 38). Health-related adaptation and resilience spending, both national totals and per capita levels, is extremely low in low-income countries and increases across the continuum towards high-income countries. Health and health-related adaptation spending as a proportion of total adaptation spending is relatively constant across income groups. Further work is required to more completely determine what should be considered as health-related adaptation	1
This indicator reports that between 2003 and 2017, 0*96% of total adaptation funding for development, flowing through global climate change financing mechanisms, was dedicated to health adaptation. The final indicator in this section was designed in parallel with Indicator 4.9 and aims to capture development funds available for climate change adaptation. It reports global financial flows for health adaptation to climate change, moving through established global climate financing mechanisms. Data were drawn from the Climate Funds Update, an independent source that has been aggregating funding data from multilateral and bilateral development agencies since 2003. Data from the Climate Funds Update is presented in four categories (pledged, deposited, approved, and disbursed); this indicator uses data designated as approved. Between 2003 and 2017, only 0*96% of approved adaptation funding was allocated to health adaptation, corresponding to a cumulative total of $39*55 million (figure 39). Total global adaptation funding peaked in 2013 at $910*36 million and decreased thereafter. However, health-related adaptation funding peaked in early 2017, resulting in the near doubling in the proportion of adaptation funding allocated to health. A brief overview of growing interest in health and climate change from the international donor community is provided in panel 8.	1
Conclusion The indicators presented in this section seek to highlight the status of the economics and finance associated with climate change and health across four themes: investment in a low-carbon economy, economic benefits of tackling climate change, pricing of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, and adaptation financing. Many of the trends show positive change with time, most notably in global investment in zero-carbon energy supply, energy efficiency, new coal-fired electricity capacity, employment in the renewable energy sector, and divestment in fossil fuels. However, the change is relatively slow and must accelerate rapidly to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.	1
and impact to enable societies to transition to a lowcarbon future.179 The overarching theme of this section is therefore the importance of public and political engagement in addressing health and climate change and the consequent need for indicators that track engagement in the public and political domains. The aim is to track engagement with health and climate change in the public and political domains and to identify trends since 2007. In selecting indicators, priority has been given to high-level indicators, which can be measured globally, tracked over time, and provide a platform for more detailed analysis in future Lancet Countdown reports. The indicators relate to coverage of health and climate change in the media, science, and government. Search terms for the indicators are aligned, and a common time-period was selected for all indicators (2007-16). The period runs from before the resolution on health and climate change by the 2008 World Health Assembly, which marked a watershed moment in global engagement in health and climate change; for the first time, member states of the UN made a multilateral commitment to protect human health from climate change.180 We present three indicators. Headline findings for each indicator are provided at the beginning of each indicator; additional detailed disussion of the data and methods is provided in the appendix (p 97).	1
Indicator 5.1: Media coverage of health and climate change This indicator reports that global newspaper coverage of health and climate change has increased by 78% since 2007, with marked peaks in 2009 and 2015 coinciding  	1
Panel 8: International donor action on climate change and health In 2017, the World Bank released three independent reports on climate change and health, articulating (1) a new action plan for climate change and health, (2) geographical focus areas, and (3) new strategy for climate-smart health care. In addition to training staff and increasing government capacity, the World Bank outlines an approach to ensuring that at least 20% of new World Bank health investments are climate-smart by 2020, corresponding to as much as US$1 billion in new climate-smart health finance for countries. Other development institutions and foundations are also getting involved. Two separate, large gatherings of public and private funders occurred in Helsinki in May, 2016, and in Chicago, IL, USA, in May, 2017, toward establishing new channels for health and climate finance, and a third is planned for October, 2017 (Washington, DC).	1
with the 15th and 21st Conference of the Parties, respectively. Media has a crucial role in communicating risks associated with climate change.181 Knowledge about climate change is related to perceptions of risk and intentions to act.182,183 Public perceptions of a nation's values and identity are also an important influence on public support for national action.184 Indicator 5.1 therefore tracks media coverage of health and climate change, with a global indicator on newspaper coverage on health and climate change (Indicator 5.1.1) complemented by an in-depth analysis of newspaper coverage on health 621	1
Indicator 5.1.1: Global newspaper reporting on health and climate change Focusing on English-language and Spanish-language newspapers, this indicator tracks global coverage of health and climate change in high-circulation national newspapers from 2007 to 2016. Using 18 high-circulation so-called tracker newspapers, global trends are shown and disaggregated regionally to provide a global indicator of public exposure to news coverage of health and climate change. Since 2007, newspaper coverage of health and climate change has increased by 78% worldwide (figure 40). However, this trend is largely driven by southeast Asian newspapers. Although mostly due to the higher number of southeast Asian newspapers included in this analysis, their average coverage of health and climate change was higher than in other regions, particularly among Indian sources (appendix p 98). This generally high volume of coverage in the Indian press can be attributed to the centrality of newspapers as communication channels for elite-level discourse in India and to relatively high levels of climate change coverage throughout Asia.185-187 For the eastern Mediterranean, Americas, and western Pacific, media reporting does not have a strong trend. Apart from some notable peaks in 2009 in Europe, this trend is largely maintained for the rest of the time series. In the Americas, a secondary peak is seen between 2012 and 2014. The first large peak in worldwide coverage was in 2009, coinciding with the Conference of the Parties in Copenhagen, for which expectations were high. Newspaper reporting then dropped around 2010 but has been rising worldwide since 2011. 622	1
Data were assembled by accessing archives through the Lexis Nexis, Proquest, and Factiva databases. These sources were selected through the weighting of four main factors: geographical diversity (favouring a greater geographical range), circulation (favouring higher circulating publications), national sources (rather than local or regional sources), and reliable access to archives over time (favouring those accessible consistently for longer periods). Search terms were aligned to those used for the indicators of scientific and political engagement and searches, with Boolean searches in English and Spanish.	1
Indicator 5.1.2: In-depth analysis of newspaper coverage on health and climate change The second part of this indicator provides an analysis of two national newspapers: the French Le Monde (France) and the German Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Le Monde and FAZ were chosen for this analysis because they are leading newspapers in France and Germany, two countries with political weight in Europe. Both newspapers continue to set the tone of public debates in France and Germany.188,189 Only a small proportion of articles about climate change mentioned the links between health and climate change (5% in Le Monde and 2% in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung). The analysis also pointed to important national differences in reporting on health and climate change. For example, in Le Monde, 70% of articles referring to health and climate change represented the healthclimate change nexus as an environmental issue, whereas in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, articles had a broader range of references: the economy (23%), local news (20%), and politics (17%). The recommended policy responses also differed; Le Monde emphasised mostly adaptation (41% of articles), whereas Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung emphasised mostly mitigation  	1
This indicator reports that since 2007, the number of scientific papers on health and climate change has more than tripled. Science is pivotal to increasing public and political understanding of the links between climate change and health, to informing mitigation strategies, and to accelerating the transition to low-carbon societies.190,191 This indicator, showing scientific engagement with health and climate change, tracks the volume of peer-reviewed reports in English-language scientific journals in PubMed and Web of Science (appendix p 104). The results show a marked increase in published research on health and climate change in the past decade, from 94 reports in 2007, to more than 275 reports in both 2015 and 2016. Within this overall upward trend, the volume of scientific reports increased particularly rapidly in 2007-09 and from 2012, plateauing between these periods (figure 41). The two periods of growth in scientific outputs coincided with the run-up to the UNFCCC Conference of Parties in Copenhagen in 2009 and in Paris in 2015. This pattern suggests that scientific and political engagement in health and climate change are closely linked, with the scientific community responding quickly to the global climate change agenda and the need for evidence. Most reports focus on the impacts of climate change and health in Europe and North America. Overall, we identified more than 2000 scientific articles, 30% of which focused on Europe and 29% of which focused on the Americas. Within the Americas, most reports (72%) were about health and climate change in North America (appendix p 106). By contrast, only 10% of articles had a focus on Africa or the eastern Mediterranean region, demonstrating a marked global inequality in the science of health and climate change (appendix p 106). Among the journals included in the analysis, infectious diseases, particularly dengue fever and other mosquitotransmitted infections, are the most frequently investigated health outcomes; about 30% of selected reports covered these health-related issues. We identified important gaps in the scientific evidence base such as migration and mental health. For this indicator, we did a scoping review of peerreviewed reports about health and climate change that were written in English and published between 2007 and 2016, an appropriate approach for broad and interdisciplinary research fields.192 We searched PubMed and Web of Science with keywords to identify reports  	1
(40% of articles). The co-benefits that public health policies can represent for mitigation were mentioned in 17% of Le Monde articles and in 9% of Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung articles. Overall, the analysis points to the marked differences in media reporting of health and climate change and in the information and perspectives to which the public is exposed (appendix p 99).	1
through a bibliometric analysis (appendix p 104).193 Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to capture the most relevant literature about the impacts of climate change on human health within the chosen timeframe, and reports were independently reviewed and screened three times to identify relevant articles.194	1
Indicator 5.3: Health and climate change in the United Nations General Assembly This indicator reports that there is no overall trend in United Nations General Debate (UNGD) references to health and climate change, but the number of references peaked twice, in 2009 and in 2014. The UNGD takes place every September at the start of each new session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Governments use their annual statements to present their perspective on events and issues they consider the most important in global politics 623	1
Figure 43: Regional political engagement with the intersection of health and climate change, represented by joint references to health and climate change in the United Nations General Debate, by WHO region	1
and to call for strengthened action from the international community. All UN member states can address the UNGA, free from external constraints. General Debate statements are therefore an ideal data source on political engagement with health and climate change, which is comparable spatially and temporally. This indicator focuses on the extent to which governments refer to linkages between health and climate change issues in their annual statements in the General Debate, with each reference representing one hit. Health and climate change are often raised in General Debate statements (appendix p 110). However, statements less frequently link health and climate change together. Between 2007 and 2016, between 44 and 124 linked references were made to health and climate change in the annual General Debate (figure 42). By comparison, between 378 and 989 references were made to climate change alone. We found no overall trend in conjoint references to health and climate change across the period. Although no overall trend is apparent, the number of references that link health and climate change peaked twice, once in 2009-11 and again in 2014. In both 2009 and 2014, 124 references were made to the link between health and climate change in the General Debate statements. The 2009 peak was after the 2008 World Health Day, which focused on health and climate change, and in the build-up to the 2009 Conference of Parties in Copenhagen. The 2014 peak is indicative of the influence of the large UNGA on climate change in 2014 and the lead up to the 2015 Conference of Parties in Paris. The 2015 UNGA, which focused on the Sustainable Development Goals, made relatively limited reference to climate change, and, after the 2014 peak, conjoint references to health and climate change decreased. This irregular pattern points to the importance of key events 624	1
in the global governance of health and climate change in driving high-level political engagement. We found many country-level differences in the attention given to health and climate change in General Debate statements (figure 43). Countries in the western Pacific, particularly by the Small Island Developing States in these regions, made most references to the issue. By contrast, governments in the east Mediterranean, the Americas, and southeast Asia made fewest references to health and climate change. This indicator is based on the application of keyword searches in the text corpus of debates. A new dataset of General Debate statements was used (UNGD corpus), in which the annual statements have been preprocessed and prepared for use in quantitative text analysis (appendix p 108).195	1
Conclusion The indicators in this section have demonstrated the importance of global governance in mobilising public and political engagement in health and climate change. The UN and the annual Conference of Parties have an important role in clearly influencing media and promoting scientific and political engagement with health and climate change. To further improve understanding of public and political engagement, indicators relating to national governments' health and climate change legislation, private sector engagement, the inclusion of climate change in professional health education, and the prominence given to health in UNFCCC negotiations are proposed for future analysis. The previous sections in this report have presented findings on the impacts of climate hazards, adaptation and resilience, co-benefits of mitigation, and finance and economics. All of these  	1
Conclusion--the Lancet Countdown in 2017 In June, 2015, the Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change2 laid the groundwork for a global monitoring platform designed to systematically track progress on health and climate change and to hold governments to account for their commitments under the then-to-be-finalised Paris Agreement.1 The Lancet Countdown will continue this work, reporting annually on the indicators presented in this Review and on new indicators developed in the future. The data and analysis presented in this Review cover a wide range of topics and themes from the lethality of weather-related disasters to the phase-out of coal-fired power. The report begins with an indicator set to track the health effects of climate change and climate-related hazards. We found that the symptoms of climate change have been clear for a number of years, with the health impacts far worse than previously understood. These effects have been spread unequally. For example, a 9*4% increase in vectorial capacity of the dengue fevercarrying A aegypti has predominantly spread in LMICs since 1950, and India has been disproportionately affected by the additional 125 million exposure events to potentially fatal heatwaves since 2000. These indicators also suggest that populations are beginning to adapt, with improvements in the world's overall health profile strengthening its resilient capacity and national governments beginning to invest in health-adaptation planning for climate change. About $47*29 billion is spent annually on health-related adaptation (about 13*3% of global total adaptation spend). However, the scientific literature and past experience make it clear that there are very real and immediate technological, financial, and political barriers to adaptation.13 The indicators in Section 3 track health-relevant mitigation trends across four sectors, with an ultimate focus of keeping global temperature rise well below 2C and meeting the Paris Agreement. At an aggregate level, the past two decades have seen limited progress here, with many of the trends and indicators remaining flat or moving strongly in the opposite direction. More recently, trends in the electricity generation (deployment of renewable energy and a dramatic slow-down in coal-fired power) and transport sectors (soon-to-be cost parity of electric vehicles with their petrol-based equivalents) provide cause for optimism because, if sustained, these trends could reflect the beginning of system-wide transformation. Indicators in Sections 4 and 5 underpin and drive toward this transition. Again, trends in the past two decades reveal concerning levels of inaction. Only in recent years have investment and interventions accelerated. Employment in the renewable energy sector has reached record high levels, overtaking employment  	1
in the fossil fuel extraction sector, and fossil fuel consumption subsidies have decreased worldwide. Carbon pricing mechanisms are slowly widening and now cover about 13*1% of worldwide CO2 emissions. In Section 5 we consider the degree to which the public, political, and academic communities have engaged with the link between climate change and health. Our findings point to uneven patterns of engagement and the pivotal role of global institutions, the UN particularly, in driving forward public, political, and scientific support for enhanced mitigation and adaptation policies. Overall, the trends elucidated in this Report provide cause for deep concern, highlighting the immediate health threats from climate change and the relative inaction seen in all parts of the world in the past two decades. However, more recent trends in the past 5 years reveal a rapid increase in action, which was solidified in the Paris Agreement. These glimmers of progress are encouraging and reflect a growing political consensus and ambition, which was seen in full force in response to the USA's departure from the 2015 climate change treaty. Although action needs to increase rapidly, taken together, these signs of progress provide the clearest signal to date that the world is transitioning to a low-carbon world, that no single country or head of state can halt this progress, and that until 2030, the direction of travel is set.

Executive summary The Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change was established to provide an independent, global monitoring system dedicated to tracking the health dimensions of the impacts of, and the response to, climate change. The Lancet Countdown tracks 41 indicators across five domains: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation, planning, and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; finance and economics; and public and political engagement. This report is the product of a collaboration of 27 leading academic institutions, the UN, and intergovernmental agencies from every continent. The report draws on world-class expertise from climate scientists, ecologists, mathematicians, geographers, engineers, energy, food, livestock, and transport experts, economists, social and poli tical scientists, public health professionals, and doctors. The Lancet Countdown's work builds on decades of research in this field, and was first proposed in the 2015 Lancet Commission on health and climate change,1 which documented the human impacts of climate change and provided ten global recommendations to respond to this public health emergency and secure the public health benefits available (panel 1).	1
The following four key messages derive from the Lancet Countdown's 2018 report: 1 Present day changes in heat waves, labour capacity, vector-borne disease, and food security provide early warning of the compounded and overwhelming impact on public health that are expected if temperatures continue to rise. Trends in climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerabilities show an unacceptably high level of risk for the current and future health of populations across the world. 2 A lack of progress in reducing emissions and building adaptive capacity threatens both human lives and the viability of the national health systems they depend on, with the potential to disrupt core public health infrastructure and overwhelm health services.  	1
3 Despite these delays, a number of sectors have seen the beginning of a low-carbon transition, and it is clear that the nature and scale of the response to climate change will be the determining factor in shaping the health of nations for centuries to come. 4 Ensuring a widespread understanding of climate change as a central public health issue will be crucial in delivering an accelerated response, with the health profession beginning to rise to this challenge.	1
Climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability Vulnerability to extremes of heat has steadily risen since 1990 in every region, with 157 million more people exposed to heatwave events in 2017, compared with 2000, and with the average person experiencing an additional 1*4 days of heatwaves per year over the same period (indicators 1.1 and 1.3). For national economies and household budgets, 153 billion hours of labour were lost in 2017 because of heat, an increase of more than 62 billion hours (3*2 billion weeks of work) since 2000 (indicator 1.4). The direct effects of climate change extend beyond heat to include extremes of weather. In 2017, a total of 712 extreme weather events resulted in US$326 billion in economic losses, almost triple the total losses of 2016 (indicator 4.1). Small changes in temperature and precipitation can result in large changes in the suitability for transmission of important vector-borne and water-borne diseases. In 2016, global vectorial capacity for the transmission of the dengue fever virus was the highest on record, rising to 9*1% for Aedes aegypti and 11*1% for Aedes albopictus above the 1950s baseline. Focusing on high-risk areas and diseases, the Baltic region has had a 24% increase in the coastline area suitable for epidemics of Vibrio cholerae, and in 2016, the highlands of sub-Saharan Africa saw a 27*6% rise in the vectorial capacity for the transmission of malaria from the 1950 baseline (indicator 1.8). A proxy of agricultural yield potential shows declines in every region, with 30 countries having downward trends in yields, reversing a decades-long trend of improvement (indicator 1.9.1).	1

Panel 1: Progress towards the recommendations of the 2015 Lancet Commission on health and climate change In 2015, the Lancet Commission made ten policy recommendations. Of these ten recommendations, the Lancet Countdown is measuring progress on the following: Recommendation 1: invest in climate change and public health research Since 2007, the number of published articles on health and climate change in scientific journals has increased by 182% (indicator 5.2). Recommendation 2: scale up financing for climate-resilient health systems Spending on direct health adaptation as a proportion of total adaptation spending increased in 2017 to 4*8% (11*68 billion), which is an increase in absolute and relative terms from the previous year (indicator 2.7). Health-related adaptation spending (including disaster response and food and agriculture) was estimated at 15*2% of total adaptation spend. Although this national-level spending is increasing, climate financing for mitigation and adaptation remains well below the US$100 billion per year committed in the Paris Agreement (indicator 2.8). Recommendation 3: phase out coal-fired power Coal consumption remains high, but continued to decline in 2017, a trend which is largely driven by China's decreased reliance and continued investment in renewable energy (indicators 3.2 and 3.3). The Powering Past Coal Alliance (an alliance of 23 countries including the UK, Italy, Canada, and France) was launched at the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in December, 2017 (COP23), committing to phase out coal use by 2030 or earlier. Recommendation 4: encourage city-level low-carbon transition to reduce urban pollution In 2017, a new milestone was reached, with more than 2 million electric vehicles on the road, and with global per-capita electricity consumption for road transport increasing by 13% from 2013 to 2015 (indicator 3.6). China is responsible for more than 40% of electric cars sold globally. Recommendation 5: establish the framework for a strong and predictable carbon pricing mechanism Although a global carbon pricing mechanism has seen limited progress, the proportion of total greenhouse-gas emissions	1
Decreasing labour productivity, increased capacity for the transmission of diseases such as dengue fever, malaria, and cholera, and threats to food security provide early warning of compounding negative health and nutrition effects if temperatures continue to rise.	1
Adaptation, planning, and resilience for health Global inertia in adapting to climate change persists, with a mixed response from national governments since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015. More than half of global cities surveyed expect climate change to seriously	1
covered by national and regional instruments is increasing from a low base. In 2017, 13*1% of greenhouse-gas emissions were covered, a proportion that is expected to increase to 20% in 2018, with the implementation of the Chinese National Emissions Trading Scheme (indicator 4.9). Recommendation 6: rapidly expand access to renewable energy, unlocking the substantial economic gains available from this transition Globally, 157 GW of renewable energy was installed in 2017, more than twice as much as the 70 GW of fossil fuel capacity that was installed (indicator 3.3), which advanced mitigation efforts and improved local air quality. This trend was mirrored by a 5*7% increase in the number of people employed in renewable energy in 2017, which reached 10*3 million jobs (indicator 4.4). From 2000 to 2016, the number of people without connection to electricity fell from 1*7 billion to 1*1 billion (indicator 3.4). Recommendation 9: agree and implement an international treaty that facilitates the transition to a low-carbon economy In response to the USA's announcement of its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, the great majority of countries provided statements of support for the agreement, reaffirming their commitment to hold global average temperature rise to well below 2C. Nicaragua and Syria have both since signed the Paris Agreement. The UNFCCC requested the development of a formal report to be delivered at COP24 (December, 2018), which is designed to provide recommendations on how public health can more comprehensively engage with the negotiation process. Recommendation 10: develop a new, independent collaboration to provide expertise in implementing policies that mitigate climate change and promote public health, and monitor progress over the next 15 years The Lancet Countdown is a growing collaboration of 27 partners, committed to an iterative and open process of tracking the links between public health and climate change. In 2018, the Wellcome Trust announced its intention to continue funding the collaboration's work, supporting ongoing monitoring across its five domains up to 2030.	1
compromise public health infrastructure, either directly, with extremes of weather disrupting crucial services, or indirectly, through the overwhelming of existing services with increased burdens of disease (indicator 2.2). Globally, spending for climate change adaptation remains well below the $100 billion per year commitment made under the Paris Agreement. Within this annual spending, only 3*8% of total development spending committed through formal UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) mechanisms is dedicated to human health (indicator 2.8). This low investment in  	1
adaptive capacity is magnified in specific regions around the world, with only 55% of African countries meeting International Health Regulation core requirements for preparedness for a multihazard public health emergency (indicator 2.3).	1
Mitigation actions and health co-benefits Multiple examples of stagnated mitigation efforts exist, with a crucial marker of decarbonisation--the carbon intensity of total primary energy supply--remaining un changed since 1990 (indicator 3.1). A third of the global population, 2*8 billion people, live without access to healthy, clean, and sustainable cooking fuel or technolo gies, which is the same number of people as in 2000 (indicator 3.4). In the transport sector, per-capita global road-transport fuel use increased by 2% from 2013 to 2015, and cycling comprises less than 10% of total journeys taken in three quarters of a global sample of cities (indicators 3.6 and 3.7). The health burden of such inaction has been immense, with people in more than 90% of cities breathing polluted air that is toxic to their cardiovascular and respiratory health. Indeed, between 2010, and 2016, air pollution concentrations worsened in almost 70% of cities around the globe, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs; indicator 3.5.1). In 2015 alone, fine particulate matter (ie, atmospheric particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2*5 m [PM2*5]) was responsible for 2*9 million premature deaths, with coal being responsible for more than 460 000 (16%) of these deaths, and with the total death toll (from other causes including particulates and emissions such as nitrogen oxide) being substantially higher (indicator 3.5.2). Of concern, global employment in fossil-fuel extractive industries actually increased by 8% between 2016, and 2017, reversing the strong decline seen since 2011 (indicator 4.4). At a time when national health budgets and health services face a growing epidemic of lifestyle diseases, continued delay in unlocking the potential health co-benefits of climate change mitigation is short-sighted and damaging for human health. Despite this stagnation, progress in the power generation and transport sectors provide some cause for optimism, with many positive trends being observed in the 2017 report,2 and which continue in the present 2018 report. Notably, coal use continues to decline (indicator 3.2) and more renewable energy was installed in 2017 than energy from fossil fuels (indicator 3.3). However, maintaining the global average temperature rise to well below 2C necessitates wide-reaching transformations across all sectors of society, including power generation, transport, spatial infrastructure, food and agriculture, and the design of health systems. These transformations, in turn, offer levers to help tackle the root causes of the world's greatest public health challenges.  	1
Finance and economics About 712 climate-related extreme events were res ponsible for US$326 billion of losses in 2017, almost triple the losses of 2016 (indicator 4.1). Crucially, 99% of the losses in low-income countries remained uninsured. Indicators of investment in the low-carbon economy show that the transition is already underway, with con tinued growth in investment in zero-carbon energy, and growing numbers of people employed in renewable energy sectors (indicators 4.2 and 4.4). Furthermore, investment in new coal capacity in 2017, was at its lowest in at least 10 years, with 2015 potentially marking a peak in coal investment. Correspondingly, global subsidies for fossil fuels continued to decrease, and carbon pricing only covers 13*1% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, a number that is expected to increase to more than 20% when planned legislation in China is implemented in late 2018 (indicators 4.6 and 4.7). However, the rise of employment in fossil fuel in dustries in 2017 reversed a 5 year downward trend, and will be a key indicator to follow closely.	1
Public and political engagement A better understanding of the health dimensions of climate change allows for advanced preparedness, in creased resilience and adaptation, and a prioritisation of mitigation interventions that protect and promote human wellbeing. To this end, coverage of health and climate change in the media has increased substantially between 2007, and 2017 (indicator 5.1). Following this trend, the number of academic journal articles published on health and climate change has almost tripled over the same period (indicator 5.2). These figures often follow internationally important events, such as the UNFCCC's Conference of the Parties (COP), along with temporary rises in mentions of health and climate change within the UN General Debate (UNGD; indicator 5.3). The extended heatwaves across the northern hemisphere in the summer of 2018, might prove to be a turning point in public awareness of the seriousness of climate change. 2017 saw a substantial rise in the number of medical and health professional associations actively respon ding to climate change. In the USA, the US Medical Society Consortium on Health and Climate represents 500 000 physicians. This organisation follows the forma tion of the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change, which brings together many of the UK's royal medical and nursing colleges and major health institutions. Organisations like the European Renal Association- European Dialysis and Transplant Association and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) are committing to reducing the contributions of their clinical practice emis sions.

College of Physicians, the Canadian Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, and the World Medical Association (indicator 4.5). Given that climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century, responding to this threat, and ensuring this response delivers the health benefits avail able, is the responsibility of the health profession; indeed, such a transformation will not be possible without it.	1
Progress on the recommendations of the 2015 Lancet Commission The 2015 Lancet Commission1 made ten global recom mendations to accelerate the response to climate change and deliver the health benefits this response could offer. A summary of the progress made against these recom mendations using the 2018 Lancet Countdown's indicators is presented in panel 1. Here, global leadership is increasingly provided by China, the EU, and many of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change.	1
disease, and compromising food security, safe drinking water, and clean air (figure 1).3 These impacts exacerbate transnational and intergenerational inequality, and com promise many of the national and global public health imperatives that doctors, nurses, and allied health pro fessionals have dedicated their lives to. The health, economic, and social implications of climate change provide enough justification for the rapid acceleration of mitigation and adaptation efforts, and clearly, successfully achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is dependent on a robust response to climate change. At the broadest level, maintaining the global average temperature rise to well below 2C necessitates the following: a complete decarbonisation of power generation away from fossil fuels, reversing a trend that began with the industrial revolution; a reorientation towards sus tainable global food and agricultural systems; a rethinking of the structure and function of spatial infrastructure and cities, and methods of transport within and between them; the safeguarding of other planetary boundaries and the reversal of deforestation and land-use change trends; and profound changes in the methods of delivery of health care.4-7 These wide-reaching interventions are linked with numerous public health priorities, providing opportunities  	1
to improve breathing conditions for 90% of the global population exposed to polluted air, tackle the root causes of obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet, alleviate social inequalities and promote social inclusion, improve work place environments, and increase access to health care and other social services.1 Taken as a whole, the form and pace of the world's response to climate change will shape the health of nations for centuries to come. The Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change is an international, politically-independent collaboration that exists to monitor this global transition from threat to opportunity. The partner ship brings together 27 leading academic institutions and UN and intergovernmental agencies from every continent, with expertise from climate scientists, ecolo gists, mathe maticians, geographers, engineers, energy, food, livestock, and transport experts, economists, social and political scientists, public health professionals, and doctors. This 2018 report tracks 41 indicators of impact and progress across five domains: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and their health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement (panel 2).	1
A global monitoring system for health and climate change For the public health profession, monitoring and tracking have long been essential tools and are important in understanding and diagnosing the problem in ques tion, predicting its future impact, identifying vulnerable populations, developing and prioritising responses, and evaluating interventions. A good indicator should be based on a credible link between public health and climate change, should be sensitive to changes in the climate, and less sensitive to non-climate explanations, its data should be available and reproducible across temporal and geographical scales, and the indicator should provide actionable information to guide policy in a timely manner.8 The Lancet Countdown has adopted an iterative and open approach to the development of indicators of the links between climate change and public health. The Lancet Countdown's 2016 report9 launched a global consultation, seeking input on what can and should be tracked, with a final set of indicators presented in its 2017 report.2 These indicators were based on the aforementioned criteria and the collaboration's time and resource constraints.2,9 This 2018 report provides an additional year of data and presents the results of 12 months of work, further developing and improving the methods and data sources for each indicator. These improvements include the following adjustments: first, new methods were used to measure indicators that captured changes in labour capacity, future projections of dengue fever (an important climate-sensitive disease), terrestrial and marine food security, climate information provided to health services,  	1

the quality and comprehensiveness of health adaptation plans, and global access to clean energy. Second, expanded geographical and temporal coverage was applied for indicators that captured mortality from air pollution (atmospheric particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2*5 m [PM2*5]) by sector, active transport uptake, employment in low-carbon industries, and engagement from governments, the scientific community, and the media in health and climate change. Third, new indicators were added, including indicators of vulnerability to extremes of heat, exposure to flood, exposure to drought, transmission suitability for malaria and pathogenic Vibrio, adaptive capacity to vector-borne disease, and corporate sector engagement in health and climate change. And fourth, proposals were made for future indicators looking to capture the mental health effects of climate change and the preparedness of the health-care infrastructure. Every year until 2030, these indicators will be developed and improved, taking into account new methods, data sources, and resources as they become available. To this end, the collaboration continuously invites input from experts and academic institutions willing to support the further development of the analysis presented in this report.	1
(indicator 3.2). Renewable energy continued to grow rapidly, with 157 GW of new capacity installed (an increase from 143 GW in 2016), compared with 70 GW of fossil fuel capacity (indicator 3.3). Health institutions, including the American Public Health Association, Medibank Australia, and the Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia, announced their commitment to divest from fossil fuels, with funds totalling $33*6 billion (indicator 4.5). The USA's announcement of its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement contrasted with the formation of a new alliance of US medical associations (including the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, and the American Academy of Paediatrics) representing 500 000 clinicians, dedicated to tackling climate change. The data presented in the Lancet Countdown's 2018 report2 provide ongoing reason for cautious optimism, with the continuation of important trends signalling the beginning of a broader transition. Despite these trends, substantially faster progress is required across the full range of indicators over the coming 5 years to meet the commitments made under the Paris Agreement.	1
This first section provides insights into the impact of anthropogenic climate change on human health, tracking its many pathways (figure 1). These indicators follow numerous mechanisms and causal pathways, looking to describe underlying population vulnerabilities, human exposures, and ultimately, the health impacts that result from a changing climate. This narrative approach, built around quantitative indicators, allows the explicit exploration of the extent to which climate change is compromising public health globally. The methods, data sources, and indicators selected for this year's Lancet Countdown report have been substantially improved. Several new indicators have been developed, including metrics on vulnerability to heat exposure (indicator 1.1), exposure to flood and drought (indicator 1.5), and the climatic suitability for transmission of malaria and pathogenic Vibrio species (indicator 1.8). Methods and data sources have also been updated and improved, with more sophisticated analysis being done on labour capacity loss due to rising temperatures (indicator 1.4) and the health implications of declining marine and terrestrial primary food productivity (indicator 1.9).	1
This report presents 41 indicators of progress in health and climate change, with global-level and regional-level results and analyses for each indicator. Detailed metho dological descriptions, data sources, and discussion are included in the appendix, which has been developed as an essential companion to the main report. In 2017, several concerning trends continued, with vulnerable populations being subjected to 157 million heatwave-exposure events, and 153 billion hours of labour being lost because of rising temperatures, which repre sents substantial increases from baseline levels (in di cators 1.3 and 1.4). Vectorial capacity for the transmission of dengue fever virus continued to rise, with 2016 being the most suitable year for transmission from Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus since the 1950 baseline was studied. The carbon intensity of the total primary energy supply (TPES) remained static at 55-57 tCO/TJ (the emission at which the TPES has been since 1990; tCO/TJ is a carbon intensity metric that estimates the tonnes of CO for each unit of total primary energy supplied), and 2*8 billion people still lived without access to healthy, clean, and sustainable cooking fuels and technologies (indicators 3.1 and 3.4). However, clear signs of progress both within and beyond the health profession's response to climate change have been observed. Health systems' adaptive capacity remained robust, and the WHO newly elected Director General listed health adaptation as among the agency's top priorities. TPES from coal-fired power continued to decline, with more than 20 countries (including the UK, Canada, Mexico, and France) committing to unilateral coal phase-out	1
Indicator 1.1: vulnerability to the heat-related risks of climate change Headline finding: rising ambient temperatures place vulnerable populations at increased risks across all WHO regions. Populations in Europe and the East Mediterranean are particularly at risk, with 42% and 43% of their populations older than 65 years vulnerable to heat exposure Increasing temperatures as a result of climate change will continue to expose vulnerable populations to additional  	1
Indicator 1.2: health effects of temperature change Headline finding: the mean global temperature change to which humans are exposed is more than double the global average change, with temperatures rising 0*8C versus 0*3C The rising vulnerability to heat-related risks of climate change (indicator 1.1) is mirrored by greater human exposures to higher temperatures. In 2017, although the global mean temperature increase relative to the 1986-2005 reference period was 0*3C, the increase in human exposure temperature (the temperature increase in populated zones) was more than double at 0*8C (figure 2). This continues an accelerating trend globally, which was identified in the Lancet Countdown's previous report.2 The methods and data sources for this indicator remain unchanged, and are described in full in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report2 and in the appendix, with data sourced from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).14	1
Indicator 1.3: health effects of heatwaves Headline finding: in 2017, an additional 157 million heatwave exposure events occurred globally, representing an increase of 18 million additional exposure events compared with 2016 The strong upward trend noted in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report,2 with notable peaks in heatwave exposure observed in 2010, and 2015, continues in this 2018 report. On average, each person was exposed to an additional 1*4 days of heatwave from 2000 to 2017  	1
heat-related morbidity and mortality, including heat stress, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease.2 Adults aged more than 65 years are particularly vulnerable, as are individuals with underlying cardiovascular diseases, dia betes, and chronic respiratory diseases, and those living in urban areas.10-12 These exact factors are used, with equal weighting, to develop an index of vulnerability to current and future heat exposure as a result of climate change. In all regions of the world, the proportion of populations vulnerable to heat exposure is rising. Europe and the eastern Mediterranean show markedly higher vulner ability than Africa and southeast Asia, a finding that is most probably the result of a more elderly population living in urban areas in these regions. In addition, demographic transitions in LMICs show accelerating upward trends in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases, especially in southeast Asia, where vulnerability has increased by 3*5% since 1990 (appendix). This heat vulnerability index was compiled using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) for trends in disease prevalence, and the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project for GDP, population densities, and demographics.13 Full details of the methods, data sources, and figures for this new indicator can be found in the appendix.	1
Figure 3: Change in the number of heatwave exposure events (with one exposure event being one heatwave experienced by one person) compared with the historical average number of events (1986-2005 average)	1
(compared with the 1986-2005 baseline). Furthermore, in 2017, an additional 157 million exposure events occurred (one exposure event being one heatwave experienced by one person), 18 million more than in 2016 (figure 3). This increase in population exposure to heatwaves continues to directly risk the health of exposed populations, but also indirectly (for in stance, through food insecurity resulting from livestock exposure to heatwaves). The methods and data sources (the ECMWF)14 for this indicator are described in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report2 and in the appendix.	1
Indicator 1.4: change in labour capacity Headline finding: in 2017, 153 billion hours of labour (3*4 billion weeks of work) were lost, an increase of 62 billion hours lost relative to 2000 Rising temperatures are a key risk for occupational health, with temperatures regularly breaching physio logical limits, making sustained work increasingly difficult or impossible.15 This indicator highlights the disproportionate impact of climate change and its effects on labour capacity in vulnerable populations, 2485	1
with a greatly improved method (as described by Kjellstrom and co-workers)15 being deployed to calculate this indicator compared with the previous report. This method assigns work-fraction loss functions to different activity sectors in accordance with the power typically expended by a worker performing that activity; labour loss is calculated as a function of the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature. Total global hours of labour loss are calculated by factoring in the working popula tion distribution and the distribution of activities across sectors in different countries. Labour is divided into three sectors: service (metabolic rate of 200 W), in dustry (300 W), and agriculture (400 W), all of which were calculated under the assumption that the worker was in the shade. As with indicators 1.2 and 1.3, weather data were obtained from the ECMWF;14 details of the method and datasets used can be found in the appendix. In total, 153 billion hours of labour were lost in 2017, an increase of 62 billion hours relative to the year 2000; notably, 80% of these losses were in the agricultural sector (appendix). The areas most affected by these changes are concentrated in already vulnerable areas in India, southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, and South America (figure 4).	1
Indicator 1.5: health effects of extremes of precipitation (flood and drought) Headline finding: changes in extremes of precipitation exhibit clear regional trends, with South America and southeast Asia among the regions most exposed to flood and drought This new indicator maps extremes of precipitation globally and is divided into two components--drought and extreme rainfall. The change in the mean number 2486	1
of severe droughts has been mapped for 2016 (appendix). This indicator highlights increased exposure in large areas of South America, northern and southern Africa, and southeast Asia, with many areas experiencing a full 12 months of drought throughout the year. Pro longed drought remains one of the most dangerous environmental determinants of premature mortality, resulting in reduced crop yields, food insecurity, and malnutrition (which in turn leads to life-long stunting, wasting, and eventually death when experienced by young children).3 The spread of water-borne disease, reduced availability of potable water, and migration as a result of reductions in arable and habitable land often compound to further wear away at the resilient capacity of populations.16 Meteorological drought trends can be used to track potential population exposure.17 The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommends the use of the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) to characterise meteorological droughts around the world, in which a severe drought is defined as periods when the SPI is less than -1*5.18,19 A full description of methods and other data sources (the ECMWF)14 can be found in the appendix.20 Floods and extreme precipitation also have severe health implications, and 15% of all deaths related to natural disasters are due to floods.21 In addition to im mediate injury and death from flood water, longer-term impacts on health include spread of infectious disease and mental illness, both of which are exacerbated by the destruction of infrastructure, homes, and liveli hoods.22,23 The second component of this new indicator maps extreme rainfall events, as a proxy indicator of flood risk. In the 2015 Lancet Countdown report by Watts and  	1
coworkers,1 flood risk was estimated for 2090 by defining a flood event as a 5 day precipitation total exceeding the 10 year rainfall level (a level of rainfall only expected once every 10 years) in the reference period. This method has been adapted here to produce extreme rainfall trends from 2000 to 2016. An extreme rainfall event is defined as commencing when the 5 day rolling sum of daily total precipitation exceeds the 10 year return level in the 1986-2005 reference period, and ending when precipi tation drops below this value. The return values and events were calculated using the European Research Area-Interim daily precipitation dataset from the ECMWF.14 Exposures were calculated as the sum of people at a location multiplied by the number of events at that location, measured in person-events. A full account of the methods and data can be found in the appendix. As with drought, changes in extreme heavy rain vary regionally, with particularly important increases in ex treme heavy rainfall events evident in South America and southeast Asia (appendix). Here, regional trends are more significant than global trends, reflecting the varying nature of climate change depending on the geographical region studied.	1
Indicator 1.6: lethality of weather-related disasters Headline finding: Annual frequencies of floods and extreme temperature events have increased since 1990, with no clear upward or downward trend in the lethality of these events Providing global estimates of human exposure, mor bidity, and mortality associated with extreme weather events is fraught with methodological complexities and gaps in reliable data. Projections suggest that, if left unmitigated, climate change is expected to result in an additional 1*4 billion drought-exposure events per year and 2 billion flood-exposure events per year by the end of the century.1 These projections are borne out in recent history, with clear increases in the annual frequencies of flood and temperature anomalies over the past 25 years. Although trends within regions and income groups have been important in the lethality of weather-related disasters, no clear trend is seen at the global level, with the exception of a slight decline in the absolute numbers of people affected by floods. Governments and national health services are increasingly adapting to extreme weather events and climate change with impress ive results (section 2). These adaptation interventions and broad development initiatives present a plausible explanation for the results identified in this report. Crucially, indicator 4.1 makes clear that health and human wellbeing is affected indirectly through the economic and social losses that result from such events. Indicator 1.6 makes use of the same methods and data sources (the Emergency Events Database)24 as those described in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report2 and in the appendix.  	1
Indicator 1.7: global health trends in climate-sensitive diseases Headline finding: although global health and development interventions have resulted in some impressive improvements in human health and wellbeing, mortality from two particularly climate-sensitive diseases, dengue fever and malignant skin melanoma, is still rising in regions most susceptible to both diseases Climate change interacts directly and indirectly with a wide variety of disease processes, ultimately acting as a force multiplier for many of the existing challenges faced by the global public health community. Drawing out mortality estimates for climate-sensitive diseases calcu lated by the GBD helps to elucidate these macrotrends over time (figure 5).13 Climate change's role in influencing these trends will vary depending on disease process, geography, and demographic profile of affected regions and populations. The reference category (all-cause mortality) shows a strong decrease in mortality rates in Africa, and a substantial reduction in southeast Asia. The number of deaths caused by diarrhoeal diseases also show marked decreases, especially in Africa. By contrast, mortality from dengue fever disease is clearly increasing rapidly, especially in regions most susceptible to its spread-- southeast Asia and the Americas. Mortality rates for malignant melanoma, which notably has a decadal delay from exposure to death and is associated with exposure to ultraviolet radiation, have increased markedly in Europe, the Americas, and the Western Pacific. The methods used to measure this indicator are described in full in the 2017 Lancet Countdown2 report and in the appendix.	1
Indicator 1.8: climate-sensitive infectious diseases Headline finding: in 2016, global vectorial capacity for the transmission of dengue virus was the highest on record, rising to 9*1% above the 1950s baseline for A aegypti and 11*1% above the baseline for A albopictus Changing climatic conditions are a key determinant for the spread and impact of many infectious diseases. Understanding how climate change is altering the environmental suitability for disease vectors, pathogen replication, and transmission is crucial to understanding the consequences for human exposure. The 2017 Lancet Countdown2 analysis on dengue virus is expanded here to include a seasonal analysis of dengue fever and global analysis of pathogenic Vibrio species and malaria. The second component of the indicator analyses publication trends of climate-change infectious-disease research. Vectorial capacity is a measure of the capacity for vectors to transmit a pathogen to a host and is influ enced by vector, pathogen, and environmental factors. Compared with the 1950s baseline, climatic changes have increased global vectorial capacity for dengue virus in the 2010s (2011-16 average) by 7*8% for A aegypti and 9*6% for A albopictus (figure 6). For both vectors, 2016 was the most suitable year on record. In addition, 2487	1
Figure 5: Global trends in all-cause mortality and mortality from selected causes as estimated by the Global Burden of Disease 2017 for the 1990-2016 period, by World Bank regions Aedes aegypti Aedes albopictus 10	1
the seasonal dynamics of vectorial capacity for dengue virus for both vectors have lengthened and strengthened (appendix). Model pro jections suggest this rise will continue for both vectors in step with greenhouse gas emissions (appendix). The contribution of mobility and globalisation to the expansion of the dengue virus vector and dengue disease burden is important to note, alongside the impact of climate change. Turning to water-borne infectious diseases, in regions with suitable salinity conditions, a consistent associ ation between sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies and cases of pathogenic Vibrio infections has been reported.25-27 In 2018, a Vibrio indicator has been added to track the environmental suitability of coastal regions for Vibrio infections on the basis of SST and salinity. This indicator was developed for Vibrio species that are pathogenic to humans, including Vibrio 2488	1
parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, and non-toxigenic Vibrio cholerae (non-O1 and non-O139 serogroups). Vibrio-caused illnesses (vibriosis) include gastroenteritis, wound infections, and septicaemia, and can be trans mitted in brackish marine waters. A clear trend of rising suitability to Vibrio infections is observable globally (notably in the northern hemisphere), with 2017 being a particularly abnormal year of decreased suitability (figure 7A). The percentage of coastal area suitable for Vibrio infections in the 2010s has increased at northern latitudes (40-70N) by 3*5% compared with the 1980s baseline. Over the same period, in two high-risk focal regions, the Baltic region and northeastern USA, increases of 24*0% and 27*0%, respectively, were observed in the area of coastline that was suitable for infections (figure 7B, C). Similarly, the number of days suitable per year has almost doubled in the Baltic region, extending the highest risk season by around 5 weeks (figure 7B). A second new indicator addresses the changing suitability for the transmission of malaria. The indicator focuses on environmental suitability for Plasmodium falciparum (African continent) and Plasmodium vivax (other regions), the two dominant parasites causing disease worldwide. The indicator shows significant changes in suitability in highland areas of Africa, with suitability increasing by 20*9% in the 2010s compared with the 1950s baseline (figure 8), and with 2016 being the fourth most suitable year (after 2002, 1997, and 2006) since the beginning of the time series (27*7% rise compared with the 1950s baseline). The expanded methods for all disease indicators are in the appendix. The final component of this indicator tracks research and published literature on climate change and infectious  	1
Worldwide, more than sufficient food is produced to feed the global population. The causes of food insecurity and undernutrition are hence both complex and multi factorial, driven by factors beyond total food availability.28,29 However, food production is already being compromised by extremes of weather that are predicted to become more frequent and extreme; yield potentials are de creasing globally, and many countries are already experiencing falling yields.30,31 A multilevel indicator is presented in this report, linking climate hazards and trends, crop yields and harvests, and undernutrition. Overall trends are tracked using globallyaggregated and country-level data, highlighting the extent to which negative impacts of climate change outweigh potential positive impacts on national nutrition and food security through varietal breeding, improved farming practices, and reductions in poverty. First, global grain potential is represented by current and future predictions of crop growth duration for maize (appendix), which acts as a proxy for yield potential, and in turn, food security. Reductions in crop growth duration for maize in each region suggests declining maize yield potential in each region and globally (figure 9, appendix).32 Second, the number of countries for which yields are trending downwards is tracked. This number fell from 56 to 32 between 2000, and 2010, but has scarcely  	1
Indicator 1.9: food security and undernutrition 1.9.1: terrestrial food security and undernutrition--headline finding: 30 countries are experiencing downward trends in crop yields, reversing a decade-long trend that had previously seen global improvement. Yield potential is estimated to be declining in every region, as measured by accumulated thermal time	1
diseases. Overall, the number of publications in the previous 12 months remains high compared with historical numbers, with a slight decrease in 2017 (75 publications) from a peak in 2016 (89 publications). A clear majority of papers continue to report on positive associations (appendix).	1
Figure 9: Change in crop growth duration relative to the 1961-90 accumulated thermal time, as a proxy for maize yield The dashed line represents the average crop growth over the period of 1961-90, and the solid red line represents an 11-year moving average.	1
decreased since, reaching 30 in 2016. For some countries, where the yield gap (the difference between actual and maximum potential yield) is small, falling yields reflect the negative effects of climate change already outweighing any technological improvement.33 The third component of this indicator tracks under nutrition, aggregated at a global scale. Although prevalence and 2489	1
absolute numbers of undernutrition have declined over the past decade, a reversal of this trend and consequent rise in undernutrition is evident in recent years. The methods and data sources used for this indicator have been improved on and expanded substantially since the 2017 Lancet Countdown report,2 to incorporate potential crop yield and actual crop production data,34 and are presented in full in the appendix; additional figures for this analysis are also available in the appendix.	1
1.9.2: marine food security and undernutrition--headline finding: SST has risen substantially in 16 of the 21 key fishing basins that were analysed, resulting in coral bleaching in many of these basins and threats to marine primary productivity being expected to follow	1
The indicator on marine food security has been further developed since the 2017 Lancet Countdown report.2 21 basins have been analysed, selected for their geo graph ical coverage and importance to marine food security.34 A multilayered indicator is tracked for each basin, monitoring changes in SST and subsequent coral bleaching from thermal stress (abiotic indicators), alongside per-capita capture-based fish consumption (biotic indicator). The data presented is sourced from NASA35 and the US Environmental Protection Agency,36 with all methods described in full in the appendix. Between 2003, and 2015, SST rose in 16 of the 21 basins analysed, rising by 1*59C globally in 2015 compared with 1950 (figure 10; appendix). Rising SST coincides with an increase in coral bleaching thermal stress (increased stress and risk of bleaching to corals resulting from prolonged rising temperatures) across many of these basins, further threatening marine primary productivity and a key source of protein for many populations. A full breakdown of coral-bleaching thermal stress by basin is provided in the appendix.	1
Indicator 1.10: migration and population displacement Headline finding: climate change is the sole contributing factor for thousands of people deciding to migrate and is a powerful contributing factor for many more migration decisions worldwide Measuring the net migratory impact of climate change will always be one of the most methodologically complex aspects of this indicator. This complexity is in large part due to the multiple factors that comprise any individual or community's decision to migrate, as described by the extensive migration and mobility literature. Attribution of forced migration or non-forced migration to climate change is complicated by the fact that the scarcity of support mechanisms to deal with climate change is typically more influential on population dynamics than climate change itself. Attributing health outcomes to migration-related decisions or the absence of such options is another difficult step, although the forthcoming Lancet Commission on Migration and Health is elucidating aspects of the health effects of migration. In the appendix, reanalyses of the work done in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report2 can be found, and follows the definitions, scoping, and method described by Watts and co-workers. A lower bound of several thousand people are now migrating with climate change as the sole contributing factor. Future projections are highly uncertain because of challenges in projecting how society, technology, and politics will change over the coming decades. Nonetheless, in the absence of planning and inter ventions, several hundred million people could end up being vulnerable to forced migration, with climate change as the sole contributing factor. To improve estimates, further research suggestions are summarised in the appendix.	1
Conclusion This section presents indicators on the vulnerability, exposure, and impact of climate change for human health. Overall, these indicators provide clear evidence of the existing health effects of climate change. Notably, vulnerability to heat has increased across all regions, exposures to heatwaves have risen further, vectorial capacity for disease vectors continues to increase, and terrestrial and marine food-security threats have grown. The regional health impacts of climate change and health vary by geography, as shown clearly in the indicators on flood and drought, highlighting the need for more detailed, national-level, and local-level analyses. The indicators presented in this section will therefore continue to be improved, with important developments already in place. Work on the development of a proxy indicator for the crucial, and under-researched area of mental health and climate change also continues, with preliminary nationallevel results now being available. Climate change aggravates risks to mental health and wellbeing when the frequency, duration, intensity, and unpredictability of weather-related hazards change.2 The resultant weather effects increase the number of people exposed or re-exposed to extreme events, and their  	1
consequent psychological problems, with suicide an extreme manifestation of trauma.37,38 Because of their rapidly growing frequency, duration, and intensity, heat waves are of particular concern, with strong evidence linking their occurrence to increases in population distress, hospital psychiatric admissions, and suicides.39-42 Less obvious effects of weather-related hazards can be especially perilous, creating food shortages, homelessness and displacement, and damaging public infra structure, power and connectivity, agricultural land, and sacred places.43 These pressures can impair social cohesion, undermining crucial supports for mental health. Recent analysis examining the relationship between hot years and the incidence of suicide in Australia has been provided (appendix).44 The adaptation and mitigation efforts of governments and health professionals clearly matter immensely in establishing the scale of the eventual health impacts of climate change. Progress in these two areas, and on the economic, financial, and political context on which they depend, is the focus of the remainder of this report.	1
With the observed and future health impacts of climate change becoming increasingly evident, and emission trajectories committing the world to further warming, accelerated adaptation interventions are needed to safe guard populations' health. As the 2030 agenda shows,45 strategies to improve community resilience are often linked to poverty reduction and broader socioeconomic development imperatives, creating the possibility of noregret scenarios.1 The health sector should be at the forefront of adaptation efforts, ensuring health systems, hospitals, and clinics remain anchors of community resilience. This underrecognised, yet growing area of practice, is the focus of this section. The data are incomplete, providing more insight into adaptation than resilience, and predominantly allow for process-based indicators. However, several indicators have been improved on since 2017: qualitative analyses of the content and quality of national adaptation strategies and vulnerability and adaptation assessments in the health sector are included to complement previous quantitative findings (indicators 2.1 and 2.6), and healthspecific adaptation questions were included in survey tools and questionnaires for climate services (indicators 2.2 and 2.5). In addition, this year's report includes a new indicator assessing adaptive capacity to vector-borne disease (indicator 2.4). The indicators presented in this report show an overall trend of increased uptake of adaptation measures. However, although adaptation activities may have increased, they do not guarantee resilience against future climate change, and hence efforts to adapt to climate change must be redoubled. This increase in efforts is largely dependent upon sufficient  	1
spending on adaptation (indicator 2.7), funding availability for adaptation (indicator 2.8), and an improved under standing of how to most effectively deliver resilience within health systems.	1
Indicator 2.1: national adaptation plans for health Headline finding: in 2015, 30 of 40 countries responding to the WHO Climate and Health Country Survey reported having national health adaptation strategies or plans approved by their respective health authority This indicator tracks the policy commitment of national governments on health adaptation to climate change. Revised data, based on the biennial WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will be presented in the 2019 Lancet Countdown report. In the interim, a qualitative analysis of 16 national health adaptation strategies and plans is presented. Of note, as the most current and available country strategies and plans were collected for this Review, the documents included might not correspond exactly to those reported in the 2015 survey findings.2 A full description of the methods used in this qualitative review can be found in the appendix. Of the 16 national health adaptation strategies or plans that were reviewed, only six were identified as being the formal health component of a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) of the UNFCCC process, referred to as an H-NAP.46 The goal of a national health adaptation strategy or plan should be to build the resilience of the existing health system. Encouragingly, three quarters of the countries (12 of 16) had established institutional arrangements to integrate climate change adaptation planning into ex isting health-related planning pro cesses. Almost all countries (15 of 16) prioritised their most crucial climate-sensitive health outcomes in the national health adaptation strategy or plan. Water-borne, food-borne, and vector-borne diseases were the most widely considered climate-sensitive health outcomes, followed by direct injuries and deaths due to extreme weather events (figure 11). Nearly two thirds of countries (10 of 16) outlined adaptation measures to address specific health effects, particularly for integrated risk monitoring, early warning, and climate-informed health Water-borne and food-borne diseases Vector-borne diseases Direct injuries and death* Nutrition and food security Respiratory diseases Non-communicable diseases Heat stress Other health outcomes Mental health 0	1

programmes. Yet less concrete measures were proposed for mental health, non-communicable diseases, respir atory diseases, and heat stress. Most countries (12 of 16) detailed a monitoring and evaluation process for the implementation of their strategy or plan with ten of these countries proposing specific indicators for each adaptation activity.	1
Indicator 2.2: city-level climate change risk assessments Headline finding: of the 478 global cities surveyed, 65% have either already completed or are currently doing climate-change risk assessments, with 51% of cities expecting climate change to seriously compromise their public health infrastructure	1
More than 50% of the world's population live in cities, generating 80% of global GDP and consuming 60% of energy. Cities' independent political and legal status often affords them flexibility in developing a compre hensive adaptation response to climate change. This	1
indicator captures both the extent to which cities have developed their own climate-change risk assessments, and their own perception of the vulnerability of their public health infrastructure to these threats. Globally, 48% of cities had completed a climate-change impact assessment, with 17% currently in progress. As part of these assessments, 51% of cities identified public health infrastructure as being particularly vulnerable to climate change, and as needing additional and rapid intervention. Global inequalities in the capacity to do such assessments are evident, with only 25% of cities in low-income countries doing so, as compared with 57% of cities in high-income countries (appendix). Regional trends are similarly correlated with development. Data for this indicator are sourced from the Carbon Disclosure Project's 2017 survey of 478 global cities, and the indicator is described in full in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report2 and in the appendix.  	1
Indicator 2.3: detection, preparedness, and response to health emergencies Headline finding: despite a previous marked increase, a substantial decline in national international health regulation capacities, relevant to climate adaptation and resilience, was observed in most WHO world regions in 2017 In total, 85% of WHO Member States responded to the 2017 International Health Regulations (IHR) monitoring questionnaire47 (see panel 6 of Watts and co-workers2 for details). Overall capacity scores have decreased for all four capacities in 2017 compared with 2016, including human resources (-9*9%), surveillance (-5*3%), preparedness (-8*5%), and response (-7*8%). We present the progress in capacity scores from 2010 to 2017 by WHO region (figure 12). The first of these capacities, human resources, has seen the most heterogeneous change across WHO regions (figure 12A). Two regions showed an increase in their capacity score, Africa (11*8%) and Europe (7*1%), whereas the remaining regions showed a decrease in their capacity score--the Americas (-15*9%), the eastern Mediterranean region (-8*0%), southeast Asia (-16*6%), and the Western Pacific region (-21*3%).48 All regions showed a decrease in surveillance capacity score (figure 12B), with Africa the region showing the greatest decrease (-8*4%), followed by the eastern Mediterranean region (-8*1%), the Americas (-6*7%), southeast Asia (-6*5%,), Europe (-1*2%), and the Western Pacific region (-1*1%).46 All regions except for Africa have seen a decrease in their preparedness capacity score;49 the African region maintained its capacity score from 2016 (figure 12C). The greatest decrease occurred in southeast Asia (18*3%), followed by the Western Pacific (12*1%), the eastern Mediterranean region (6*9%), the Americas (5*3%), and Europe (4*9%). Similar to surveillance capacity, all regions showed a decrease in their response capacity score (figure 12D), with the greatest decrease occurring in the eastern Mediterranean region (-12*6%), followed by southeast Asia (-11*1%), the Americas (-10*2%), Africa (-6*8%), the Western Pacific (-3*3%), and Europe (-2*4%).50 Importantly, these figures are affected by a substantial improvement in reporting (appendix).	1
Indicator 2.4: climate change adaptation to vulnerabilities from mosquito-borne diseases Headline finding: globally, improvements in public health have reduced vulnerability to mosquito-borne diseases, with a 28% fall in global vulnerability observed from 2010-16 As indicator 1.8 makes clear, climate change is already contributing to changing patterns of burden of disease from vector-borne illnesses, such as dengue fever and malaria. Robust public health adaptation strategies can help to reduce these risks. This new indicator is the first in a set of indicators that are in development, assessing adaptive capacity to specific climate-related risks. The indicator maps the preparedness and response capacity of governmental institutions to prevent, prepare for,  	1
cope with, and recover from climate change impacts. Using a process-based mathematical model, relevant country-level core capacities (drawn from the WHO IHR, describing states of surveillance and response to infectious disease outbreaks) were inversely related to the hazard of being exposed to the dengue vector A aegypti.51 The index combines estimates of risk of exposure to A aegypti that a population could face, with the adaptive capacity of the public health system. Improvements in relevant areas of core capacity over the study period translate into increased adaptive capacity (decreased vulnerability) to mosquito-borne diseases. The largest decrease in vulnerability was observed in the Western Pacific and the Americas. The only region to experience an increase in vulnerability was the eastern Mediterranean. Importantly, as exposures to climate-sensitive diseases change (indicator 1.8), the existing adaptive capacity reported here might be threatened, and thus vulnerability to such diseases could increase in future. The data and methods for this new indicator are described in full in the appendix, in which figures are also available.	1
Indicator 2.5: climate information services for health Headline finding: the national meteorological and hydrological services of 53 countries report providing climate services to the health sector This indicator has been enhanced since 2017, with the original survey now replaced by the WMO Country Profile Database integrated questionnaire.52 Not only does this questionnaire provide greater insights into the nature of the provision of climate services to the health sector than previously, it also allows for continuous updating of this indicator. A snapshot of responses as of May, 2018, were used; the methods and data for this indicator are presented in full in the appendix, and a full list of the countries reporting to provide climate services to the health sector is included. Of the 55 national meteorological and hydrological services of WMO member states providing climate services to the health sector, 14 were from Africa, 11 from the Americas, four from the eastern Mediterranean, 18 from Europe, three from southeast Asia, and five from the Western Pacific. Furthermore, services from 47 countries provided additional detail on the status of climate service provision to the health sector: ten countries reported to have initiated engagement with the health sector, 13 reported to be undergoing health sector needs definition, seven reported to be co-designing climate products with the health sector, 14 reported that tailored products are accessible to the health sector, and three reported that climate services are guiding the health sector's policy decisions and investments plans. For the remaining countries, whether they did not respond to this section of the survey or whether they are not providing services is unknown. 2493	1
 Future iterations of the Lancet Countdown will aim to understand the extent to which individual hospitals and health systems are adapting to climate change. A regular survey done as part of the Health Care Climate Challenge is attempting to gather such information. Although the data do not have sufficient global coverage and annual reproducibility, they provide some insight into the measures taken at the health system level, and could potentially represent a promising source for a future indicator. Participants include health centres, hospitals, and health systems, answering questions related to climate-change risk assessment and preparedness activities. Respondents to the survey are currently only based in the USA, the UK, Australia, Brazil, France, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, with the vast majority being in high-income countries. Participants also represent the most engaged health systems, introducing an element of bias into any analysis. Both adaptation engagement (respondents who have completed a vulnerability and adaptation assessment), and adaptation activity (respondents who have begun to implement preparedness activities) provide potentially useful sources of data for future analyses. Although the level of engagement rose somewhat between 2015, and 2016, adaptation activity is much lower, with only 57% of health systems, 22% of hospitals, and 20% of health centres having developed a plan to address future health-care service delivery needs resulting from climate change. Within this sample, these results suggest that there may be more capacity to undertake risk assessments than to plan and implement adaptation activities, or may suggest a delay between risk assessment and risk reduction efforts.	1
Indicator 2.6: national assessments of climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation for health Headline finding: in 2015, more than two thirds of the countries that responded to the WHO Climate and Health Country Survey reported to have done a national assessment of climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation for health To design a comprehensive health adaptation plan to effectively respond to climate risks and reduce adverse health outcomes, a thorough assessment of a country's potential health impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation needs is crucial.53 Similar to indicator 2.1, revised data from the WHO Climate and Health Country Survey is not available for this report. In the interim, WHO did a qualitative analysis of the nature and quality of 34 national assessments. A brief summary is presented here, with methodological details presented in the appendix. Of note, because the most recent and available country assessments were collected for this Review, the assessments that are included might not correspond exactly to those reported in the 2015 survey findings. 2494	1
More than two thirds of countries that did the national assessments (26 of 34) anticipated the integration of the assessment findings into their national climate-change adaptation strategy, and planned to use the assessments to provide evidence-based policy options for health systems and public health. 31 countries evaluated to some extent the adaptive capacity of their health sector, with the highest number of countries assessing adaptive capacity in the areas of programmes (28 countries), infrastructure (28 countries), and human resources (25 countries). By comparing the countries' assessments of vulnerability and adaptive capacity with their proposed adaptation measures, we showed that 23 countries had a corresponding needs-to-actions translation, according to the established criteria for the analysis (appendix). Detailed specifications of how adaptation measures would be implemented, however, were often absent, and resource constraints, data availability, and capacity continue to be factors limiting the scope and coverage of national assessments. Mirroring national adaptation actions, capturing and better under standing how individual health systems are preparing and adapting to climate change is equally important (panel 3).	1
Indicator 2.7: spending on adaptation for health and health-related activities Headline finding: globally, spending on adaptation for health is estimated to be 4*8% (11*68 billion) of all adaptation spending, and health-related spending is estimated to be 15*2% (32*65 billion) This indicator tracks global adaptation spending on health (spending directly within the formal health-care sector) and health-related spending (spending in health care, disaster preparedness, and agriculture). Such spending can sub stantially reduce the mortality associated with climate-related disasters, and monitoring this expenditure over time is important (panel 4). Using the Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change (A&RCC) data reported last year,54 health adaptation spending was shown to increase by 8*2% in 2016-17 compared with 2015-16. This percentage increase is larger than the change in total adaptation spending over the same period (5*01%). Globally, relative health-adaptation spending has grown slightly from 4*6% for all adaptation spending estimated by the A&RCC dataset in 2015-16 to 4*8% of all spending in 2016-17 (a percentage change of 3*1%). For the wider health-related values, relative spending increased from 13*5% to 15*2% of total A&RCC spending grouped by World Bank income group, the highest percentage change in health adaptation spending was in lower middleincome countries followed by low-income countries, although the differences at this level of aggregation are small (figure 13).55 Grouped by WHO region, the highest percentage change is observed in Europe and southeast Asia. However, noting the much lower spending in lowincome countries is important, because despite large percentage changes, the total spending in low-income countries is still far too low to meet their needs.  	1
Indicator 2.8: health adaptation funding from global climate financing mechanisms Headline finding: the amount of adaptation funding falls short of the commitments made in the Paris Agreement, with just $472*82 million of adaptation funding for development in 2017; only 3*8% of the funding in 2017 was allocated for health adaptation This indicator makes use of the same data source (Climate Funds Update)56 and methods as those described in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report.2 The past 12 months saw the approval of a new health-adaptation programme in east Asia and the Pacific to scale-up health system resilience in Pacific Island Least Developed Countries. At $17*85 million, this project was the only health-focused project to be approved in 2017, and represented 3*8% of the total 2017 adaptation spending for development ($472*82 million), far less than the annual $100 billion for adaptation efforts by 2020 promised at the 2010 Cancun Agreements under the UNFCCC (appendix).57	1
Conclusion The data presented in section 2 suggests that health professionals and health systems are increasingly considering and responding to the health effects of climate change. There appears to be more and earlier engagement in higher-resource settings than lowresource settings, although there is evidence of adapta tion activity in health sectors across the developmental and geographic spectrum. There is evidence of health adaptation occurring incidentally, through broad de velopment initiatives, such as IHRs (indicator 2.3 and 2.4), and directly through specific climate-change adap tation initiatives (indicators 2.1, 2.2, and 2.6). Although absolute preparedness remains low, most trends followed in this report are moving in the right direc tion, and when vulnerability has been tracked, risks related to climate change appear to be decreasing. Despite this positive trend, absolute funding available for health adaptation remains particularly low, limiting further progress on this issue. Furthermore, powerful technological and financial limits to adaptation exist, and these necessitate a joint focus on mitigation as part of the global response to climate change.3 Measuring health adaptation and resilience to climate change presents numerous methodological challenges, with most available metrics being proxy indicators of progress. These measures must be interpreted with caution and applied to climate change, rather than solely in their original context. This section has worked to present findings of indicators for adaptation assess ments, planning, implementation, and financing.	1
Panel 4: Deaths from climate-related disasters versus health spending The number of people killed in climate-related disasters is a function of the strength of the climate hazard, the exposure of the population to the hazard related to the number of people in the hazard location, and the underlying vulnerability of the population. Governments can reduce deaths to climate-related disasters through disaster preparedness measures, such as early-warning systems and via enhanced health services for those affected by a disaster. Although generally countries with higher GDPs (gross domestic products) have lower numbers of disaster fatalities than countries with lower GDPs, this relationship does not necessarily hold when also accounting for the number of people exposed to climate hazards (appendix). Instead, a clear relationship exists between deaths per capita from climate-related disasters and per-capita health national spending. Countries that spend more on health tend to have fewer deaths from such disasters than countries that spend less. Although health spending (per capita) is related to GDP (per capita), the relationship is not one to one (appendix). Most notably, when ranking countries by the percentage of GDP that is spent on health, for the first three quartiles of countries, a decrease in deaths per capita from disasters related to climate hazards can be seen as the percentage of GDP increases. This finding would appear to support the notion that as governments allocate more of their GDP to health spending per capita, they decrease the number of deaths (per capita) from climate-related disasters for all countries, except those in the highest percentage of the health spending quartile. This raises serious questions as to which elements of health spending are most effective at reducing climate-related disaster deaths; for example, whether preparedness or primary health or response have the greatest role in minimising mortality.	1
health. The health impacts of climate change, and communities' ability to adapt to it, both depend on the success of global mitigation efforts. But mitigation also has more immediate co-benefits arising from the changes in harmful exposures (eg, reductions in particle air pollution) and health-related behaviours that mitigation actions entail. Therefore, the pace of the low-carbon transition establishes the degree to which such benefits are realised. The changes since the 2017 Lancet Countdown report2 mostly reflect continuing trends or modest incremental shifts. A shift of investment towards clean energy tech nologies continues to occur, with accelerating growth in new low-carbon power generation (indicator 3.3) and a downward trend in global demand for coal (indicator 3.2). However, global energy-sector carbon emissions remain largely unchanged (indicator 3.1) and ambient air pollution remains generally poor (indicator 3.5), with estimated contributions of different sectors to PM*-attributable 2495	1

mortality presented in indicator 3.5.2. The number of electric vehicles purchased has increased, but the electricity they use is still largely derived from fossil fuels (indicator 3.6), and they account for only a very small fraction of the vehicle fleet.	1
Indicator 3.1: carbon intensity of the energy system Headline finding: since 1990, the carbon intensity of TPES has remained static with no reduction at 55-57 tCO/TJ This year's report includes 4 years of additional data compared with the 2017 Lancet Countdown report,2 and shows that the global trend in carbon intensity remains broadly unchanged. This means an ever-widening gap from the required path of rapid reduction towards zero emissions by 2050 to fulfil the Paris Agreement, which would require a decline in carbon intensity approximately equivalent to an average reduction of 1*0-1*6 tCO/TJ per year. 2496	1
Carbon intensity remains high despite the continued growth of renewable electricity (indicator 3.3), and the decrease in coal demand (indicator 3.2), in large part caused by the growth in use of other fossil fuels, such as oil and natural gas, has continued apace, especially in the rapidly growing economies of Asia (figure 14). Growth in renewables still has a long way to go before it begins to influence global carbon intensity enough to decrease these trends, because renewables account for only 24% of total electricity generated, of which 16% is hydroelectricity. In final energy terms, these sources only met 4*5% of the global demand in 2015.58 CO emissions appear to have levelled off from 2014 (figure 14); however, analysis by the Global Carbon Project suggests that emissions have begun rising again, with a projected 1*5% increase between 2016 and 2017.58 This rise, due to stronger economic growth in China and other developing regions, highlights that further  	1

Accelerating the downward trend in coal demand will be crucial to meeting the climate goals embodied in the Paris Agreement. For example, to meet the 1*5C warminglimit target, coal use needs to be at 20% of 2010 usage by 2040, or around 30 EJ (figure 15).60 Although there is optimism that coal consumption can be substantially reduced, particularly in China, the question is whether this reduction can be achieved quickly enough to meet climate goals, and whether this overall trajectory will also follow for countries with high growth demand.61 For example, growth in India in 2016 was of 2*4% (a decrease from previous years), but consumption in member states of the Association of South East Asian Nations, where coal has a small but growing role in electricity production, increased by 6*2% in 2016. Furthermore, estimates suggest a 1% increase in coal use in India in 2017.62 If coal phase-out can be sustained, this decrease in coal consumption is likely to have important air pollution co-benefits (indicator 3.5), which in turn help offset the policy costs of mitigation.63,64 Crucially, renewable genera tion has become increasingly cost-competitive, with auctions in India placing solar power as the cheapest available form of electricity generation.65,66 Strong political momentum for the phase-out of coal has also occurred since the 23rd COP to the UNFCCC (COP23) in December, 2017, with many countries (eg, the UK, France, and Canada) pledging to phase-out coal use, forming the Powering Past Coal Alliance.67 Furthermore, 20 additional countries committed to phase-out the use of coal-fired power generation by 2030 at the most recent UN climate summit, with a few countries, including France, Italy, and the UK, aiming to phase-out coal earlier than 2030.68 Other countries have included coal reduction targets in their nationallydetermined contributions of the Paris Agreement.69 For instance, Indonesia has stated that coal will make up no more than 30% of its energy supply by 2025, and 25% by 2050. Such commitments are crucial given that coal demand continues to increase, particularly across Asia (figure 15); of the 60 GW of new coal plants installed globally in 2017 (100 GW in 2015), two thirds were in	1
Indicator 3.2: coal phase-out Headline finding: since 2013, coal use has declined, resulting largely from reductions in coal consumption in China, enhanced efficiency in coal-fired power generation, and continued increase in use of shale gas in the USA. In 2016, this downward trend continued; however, preliminary data suggest coal consumption might increase slightly in 2017and 2018	1
structural change in the energy system is needed to safeguard gains. In addition to the incentives provided from demands for clean energy investment, policies are also needed that incentivise suppliers into a timely transition out of existing fossil-based infrastructure.59 The methods and data sources58 for this indicator are described in full in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report2 and in the appendix.	1
Indicator 3.3: zero-carbon emission electricity Headline finding: in 2017, 157 GW of renewable energy was installed (143 GW in 2016) compared with 70 GW (net) of fossil-fuel capacity installation, continuing the trend reported in 2017 The low-carbon electricity sector is thriving, with strong prospects for displacing fossil fuels, such as coal, in the electricity generation sector because of its costcompetitiveness. Globally, this increase in low-carbon electricity generation is playing out with much more investment in renewable than fossil fuel-based capacity, with the number of renewable capacity installations in 2017 being more than double that of fossil fuel capacity. 2497	1

Approximately 30% of global electricity generation is from zero-carbon sources, with the majority coming from hydropower and nuclear power. In 2015, 5% of global electricity generation was from so-called new renewables (solar and wind power), rising from 0*5% in 2000. This growth is particularly evident in the USA, China, northwest Europe, and India, all of which are expanding their renewables deployment (figure 16A and C). The increasing share of renewable generation either displaces fossil fuel generation or meets a portion of new demand growth, reducing the need for investment in fossil fuels (figure 16B and D). The data and methods for this indicator are reported in the 2017 Lancet Countdown2 and the appendix.71	1
Indicator 3.4: access to clean energy Headline finding: the number of people without connections to electricity decreased from 1*7 billion in 2000 to 1*1 billion in 2016, and many countries will achieve electricity for all by 2030, with the greatest gains to be seen in east Asia and southeast Asia. Conversely, more than 2*8 billion people still go without healthy, clean, and sustainable cooking fuel or technologies, the same number as in 2000 The reduction in the number of people without access to electricity from 1*7 billion in 2000 to 1*1 billion in 2016, 2498	1
is primarily due to an increase in new connections made to a centralised grid, although modest gains continue for decentralised grids or microgrids. Most new access was achieved using electricity generated with fossil fuels, highlighting a key challenge in moving towards a decarbonised energy system. Much of this growth has been driven by coal-generated power stations in China, India, and southeast Asia; at 37%, coal remains the main fuel used in global electricity production.58 Although strong economic, health, and social benefits come from increased use of electricity, costs (such as exacerbated outdoor ambient air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions) will vary depending on how electricity is provided (indicator 3.5). The residential sector's energy mix has changed over 15 years alongside access to electricity, which has been driven largely by fossil fuel generation. The complicated nature of the relationship between energy access and health is fraught with local synergies and tradeoffs (panel 5). Access and use of clean fuels and technologies for cooking has seen limited improvement since 2000, and in several countries negative trends have been observed as the access gap increases. Access to clean cooking remains a continuous problem, with around 3 billion people (1*9 billion in developing Asia and 850 million in  	1
sub-Saharan Africa) without clean cooking fuel or technologies in 2016, exposing vulnerable populations to high amounts of harmful indoor air pollution, estimated to cause 3*8 million deaths per year.73 Biomass remains the single largest fuel source in the residential sector, which outlines the challenge of access to clean and modern fuels. The appendix provides further details and a figure on the proportional national share of energy types for the residential sector for selected countries.74	1
Indicator 3.5: exposure to ambient air pollution An estimated 7 million people die each year from air pollution, and 4*2 million of these deaths are a result of ambient air pollution.75 Much of this pollution is related to combustion processes, which would be substantially reduced by the achievement of climate-change mitigation targets to phase-out dependence on fossil fuels. Rural areas are not spared, facing important health burdens caused by air pollution from agricultural practices and household fuel use.	1
3.5.1: exposure to air pollution in cities--headline finding: from 2010 to 2016, air pollution concentrations have worsened in almost 70% of cities around the globe, particularly in LMICs. Populations in 90% of cities are subjected to air pollution concentrations that are higher than WHO's guideline of 10 g per m Trends in urban concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM*) between 2010, and 2016, were analysed by the Data Integration Model for Air Quality for 308 globally representative cities of the Sustainable Healthy Urban Environments (SHUE) database.76,77 Annual average concentrations of PM* increased in 208 (67*5%) of these cities and decreased in 100 (32*5%) cities, with an average increase of 3*6 g per m per year (unweighted by population; figure 17). The number of cities in which the concentrations of fine particulate matter were higher than WHO's annual guideline of 10 g per m increased from 254 (82*5%) to 268 (87*0%). These estimates are consistent with those of 4000 cities covered by the most recent update of WHO's air pollution database.78 Concentrations in the majority of cities remain much higher than recommended targets, especially in LMICs,79 which in part reflects the slow pace of change towards a low-carbon world.	1
3.5.2: premature mortality from ambient air pollution by sector--headline finding: in 2015, ambient air pollution resulted in more than 2*9 million premature deaths globally from fine particulates alone. Coal use accounts for approximately 16% of air pollution-related premature mortality globally, making its phase-out a crucial no-regret intervention for public health Indicator 3.5.2 reports premature mortality from ambient PM*, attributed to individual emission sectors by region. This indicator is derived from calculations with the Greenhouse Gas Air Pollution Interactions and  	1
Panel 5: Energy, health and the Sustainable Development Goals The 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development is a comprehensive global plan of action for people, the planet, and prosperity, comprised of 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) and 169 targets to be achieved by 2030. SDG number 7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy, and provides an example of a goal that delivers supporting infrastructure that underpins the achievement of other SDGs. In recognition of these interactions, analysis of efforts to achieve SDG number 7 and the delivery of the 169 targets reveals evidence of 143 synergies and 65 tradeoffs.72 There are many interdependencies between energy and SDG number 3 on health (ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages), including evidence of synergies with eight of 13 targets, and tradeoffs with five targets. Synergies exist, for instance, with target 3.2 (end preventable deaths of children and newborn babies). Access to electricity supports using medical equipment at health centres, ensuring good surgery and delivery conditions for prenatal and neonatal care and for storage of medical supplies. However, there are potential tradeoffs for which, for example, electricity access (target 7.1) is provided with non-carbon neutral sources, with probable detrimental effects on human health through air pollution (targets 3*4 and 3*9) and climate change (SDG number 13). The SDGs provide an important opportunity to realise the positive interactions between goals, such as energy and health, and to minimise the negative outcomes. However, these relationships are often context-specific, requiring consideration of how actions to achieve one SDG may reinforce or undermine progress towards another. For energy and health, the needs will differ according to scale-- for instance, communities cooking with firewood will require different solutions than cities dealing with high concentrations of ambient particulate matter from wood burning from heating homes.	1
Synergies model, which calculates emis sions of all precursors of PM* with a detailed breakdown of economic sectors and fuels used. Underlying activity data are based on statistics by the International Energy Agency (IEA).80 Emissions and concentrations correspond to the year 2015, and are calculated from updated statistics of the World Energy Outlook 2017.81 The geographical coverage has been expanded since the 2017 report to global coverage, and the breakdown has been refined to quantify contributions from coal combustion in all sectors (figure 18). Although the analysis is done by country, results are aggregated by region for clarity. The contribution of individual sectors to total air pollution-related premature mortality varies regionally, but numerous sources contribute in each region. Large 2499	1
Indicator 3.6: clean fuel use for transport Headline finding: global road transport fuel use (terajoule fuel consumption) increased 2% from 2013 to 2015 on a per-capita basis. Although fossil fuels continue to dominate, the growth in use of non-fossil fuels outpaced fossil fuels in recent history, rising by 10% over the same period	1
ambient air pollution); this proportion rises to about 18% of premature deaths in Asia. Regional contributions vary from 9% in southeast Asia, 14% in south Asia, almost 30% in China, and more than 40% in Mongolia, indicating large potential for direct health benefits of coal phase-out. China and India are particularly affected, with an estimated 911 000 premature deaths in China and 525 000 in India being caused by ambient air pollution; coal accounts for 204 000 of these deaths in China and 107 000 of these deaths in India. In the EU, the number of premature deaths from ambient air pollution was about 310 000 in 2015; 53 506 of these premature deaths were from coal and 42 028 from the transport sector. Household fuel combustion is also a substantial contributor, accounting for a total of 678 000 premature deaths from ambient air pollution (136 000 from coal) globally in 2015, and many more from indoor air pollution, and hence even larger reductions in premature mortality could be achieved through a transition to clean household fuels.	1

Also shown are the range for all cities (light blue shaded area) and cities with the largest decrease (green lines) and increase (red dotted lines) over the period based on linear trends. PM*=atmospheric particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2*5 m.	1
contributions come from the residential sector (much from solid fuel, such as biomass and coal, and kerosene used for household heating and cooking), industry (the dominant contributor in east Asia), electricity generation, transport, and agriculture (from burning of agricultural waste and secondary inorganic aerosol formation). Coal is a key target for early phase-out because this type of fuel is particularly polluting with regards to both CO2 and particulate matter. Coal is mainly used in electricity generation, industry, and (in some countries) households. In total, exposure to ambient air pollution is estimated to have contributed to almost 3 million premature deaths globally (almost 2 million in Asia, 130 000 in the Americas, more than 300 000 in Africa, and almost 500 000 in Europe) in 2015. On average, more than 460 000 premature deaths are related to coal combustion globally (about 16% of all premature deaths due to 2500	1
Fuels used for transport produce more than half the nitrogen oxides emitted globally, and a substantial proportion of particulate matter, posing a great threat to human health.82 These pollutants are predominantly urban in their nature, and persist as a substantial contributor to urban ambient-air pollution and pollutantrelated deaths (indicator 3.5), of which two thirds are related to air pollution. This indicator monitors global trends in fuel efficiency and the transition away from the most polluting and carbon-intensive transport fuels; the indicator follows the metric of fuel use for road transportation on a per-capita basis (terajoule per person) by type of fuel.83,84 Globally, despite notable gains for electricity and biofuels, road transport continues to be powered almost exclusively by fossil fuels (figure 19). Since the previous publication,2 the use of non-fossil fuels (electricity and biofuels) has continued to outpace fossil fuel energy, rising more than 10% on a per-capita basis compared with an overall growth of 2% for fossil fuels from 2013 to 2015. This trend had a small, but notable, effect on the overall share of non-fossil fuel energy for road transport, which rose from 3*9% to 4*2% over these two years. The take up of electric vehicles across the global motor vehicle stock has increased by a further 1 million vehicles, or 50%, from 2016.85,86 More than 2 million electric ve hicles are on the road, and global per-capita electricity con sumption for road transport grew by 13% from 2013 to 2015.87 In Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, per-capita electricity  	1
consumption for transport more than doubled compared with a 10% increase in non-OECD countries. In China, per-capita electricity use was five times the global average because of the country's high market share of electric vehicles. In 2016, China accounted for more than 40% of the electric cars sold globally (appendix).87	1
Indicator 3.7: sustainable travel infrastructure and uptake Headline finding: cycling comprised less than 7% of total modal share for a fifth of global cities sampled from the SHUE database, stratified by income, population size, and geography Although the shift to clean fuels is imperative, green house-gas emissions and those of air pollutants can also be reduced by moving from private motorised transport to more sustainable modes of urban travel (such as public transport, walking, and cycling). These sustainable modes of travel reduce emissions from vehicles, which is crucial for addressing urban air pollution (indicator 3.5.1) and has several health co-benefits. Focusing on sustainable travel infrastructure and uptake in urban areas, this section focuses on cycling modal share, presenting the data collected over the past decade from 48 of all the randomly sampled cities across the world (stratified by national wealth, population size, and Bailey's Ecoregion) in the SHUE database.88 Mode share data come from travel surveys of individual cities, national census data, and governmental and non-governmental reports (appendix). Within the sample, the prevalence of cycling is low in most cities, with less than 10% of trips being made by cycling. However, the prevalence of cycling is high in some Western Pacific cities, notably those in Cambodia and China, and European cities, such as Copenhagen. Nonetheless, relatively low prevalence of cycling persists in the Americas, eastern Mediterranean, and many European cities (appendix). Increasing the prevalence of cycling in some settings is challenging, but cycling mode shares can be improved in many cities. Evidence suggests that good cycling infra structure, integration with public transport, training of both cyclists and motorists, and making driving in convenient and expensive can help make cycling more attractive.89,90 A full description of the data and methods for this indicator are available in the appendix.	1
Indicator 3.8: ruminant meat for human consumption Headline finding: the amount of ruminant meat available for human consumption worldwide has decreased slightly from 12*09 kg per capita per year in 1990, to 11*23 kg per capita per year in 2013. The proportion of energy (kcal per capita per day) available for human consumption from ruminant meat decreased marginally from 1*86% in 1990 to 1*65% in 2013 Defining and tracking meaningful changes in sus tainable, healthy food production presents multiple challenges. The 2017 report2 presented ruminant meat for human consumption (which decreased slightly from 12*09 kg per capita per year in 1990 to 11*23 kg per capita  	1

Country aggregations correspond largely to WHO regions, except for small exceptions (appendix). PM*=atmospheric particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2*5 m.	1
per year in 2013) because the production of ruminant meat, from cattle in particular, dominates greenhouse-gas emissions from the livestock sector (estimated at 5*6-7*5 gigatons of CO emission per year). Although meat is a highly nutritious food, consumption of red meat, particularly proces sed red meats, has known associations with adverse health outcomes.91,92 The major limitation of this indicator is that it reflects only one aspect of sustainable diets, which is unlikely to have equal health implications for high-income countries with excessive ruminant-meat consumption and low-income countries with low ruminant-meat consumption. Track ing progress towards more sustainable diets requires standardised and continuous data on food consumption and related greenhouse-gas emissions throughout food product life cycles. This process would require annual nationally representative detailed dietary survey data on food consumption. Efforts to compile data and ensure comparability are underway, but their format is not suitable for global monitoring of progress towards optimal dietary patterns. The collaboration will continue to work on developing a standardised indicator on sustainable diets.	1
Indicator 3.9: health-care sector emissions Headline finding: no systematic global standard for measuring the greenhouse-gas emissions of the health-care sector exists, but several health-care systems in the UK, the USA, Australia, and around the world are working to measure and reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions Comprehensive national greenhouse-gas emission repor ting by the health-care system is only routinely done in the UK, where NHS emissions decreased by 11% from 2007 to 2015, despite an 18% increase in activity.93 In Australia, CO emissions of the health-care sector were estimated to be 35 772 kilotons in 2014-15, which is 7% of Australia's total emissions.94 In the USA, a study estimated the greenhouse-gas emissions of the health-care sector to be 655 million metric tons, nearly 10% of US emissions.95 Elsewhere, selected health-care organisations, facilities, and com panies provide self-reported estimates of 2501	1

Conclusion The indicators presented in this section provide an overview of activities that are relevant to public health and climate change mitigation in the energy, transport, food, and health-care sectors. The indicators present a mixed picture. Positive trends include ongoing commitments to the phase-out of coal in many countries, the fact that renewable energy continues to account for most added capacity annually, and the increasingly rapid uptake of electric vehicles. However, the scale of the challenge in reversing past trends and rapidly reducing greenhouse-gas emissions is immense. Mitigation action to date is still far lower than the action required to meet the aspirations of the Paris Agreement to keep warming well below 2C. Not only is this fact a concern for limiting the future harms of climate change, but this also means that many near-term benefits for health, such as those from improved air quality, are not being realised. Rapid acceleration of action in almost all sectors and across all regions is still needed.	1
So far, indicators in the first section of the Lancet Countdown's 2018 report have highlighted the health impacts of climate change, whereas those in sections 2 and 3 detail the adaptation and mitigation interventions deployed to respond to this public health challenge. Section 4 focuses on the financial and economic enablers of a transition to a low-carbon economy, and the impli cations of inaction. Although on the face of it, some of the indicators presented do not have an immediately obvious link to human wellbeing (for example, indicator 4.3), these indicators are often important upstream determinants and drivers of the processes described in sections 1-3. 2502	1
The consequences of climate change come with clear costs, both to human health and the economy, including increased health-care costs and decreased workforce productivity. However, health and economic benefits, beyond avoiding the potential costs of inaction, are also to be gained from tackling climate change. Markandya and co-workers96 estimate that the global cost of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in line with the aims of the Paris Agreement could be offset by the economic value of improved health associated with the co-benefit of reduced air pollution alone, by a ratio of 2:1. The eight indicators in this section fall into four broad themes: the economic costs of climate change, investing in a lowcarbon economy, economic benefits of tackling climate change, and pricing greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels. The methods and datasets used closely mirror those from the 2017 Lancet Countdown report,2 with no substantial changes to the indicators being made in this year's report. The nature of economic and financial data allows for important updates despite the regular annual update cycle of the Lancet Countdown. The appendix provides a more detailed discussion of the data and methods used, as initially described in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report.2	1
Indicator 4.1: economic losses due to climate-related extreme events Headline finding: in 2017, a total of 712 events resulted in $326 billion in overall economic losses, with 99% of losses in low-income countries remaining uninsured. This is almost triple the total economic losses of 2016 The economic costs of extreme climate-related events, borne by individuals, communities, and countries, often compounds the direct health effects described in indi cators 1.2-1.6. These economic costs often result in insidious, indirect effects on health and wellbeing in the subsequent months to years. With projections suggesting the frequency and intensity of these events will increase substantially, this indicator tracks the present day total  	1

annual economic losses (insured and uninsured) across country income groups relative to GDP, resulting from climate-related extreme events (figure 20). The data for this indicator are sourced from Munich Re's NatCatSERVICE,97 with climate-related events categorised as meteorological, climatological, and hydro logical events (geophysical events are excluded). The methods used have not changed since 2017, and are described in full in the 2017 report,2 and in the appendix, along with data for 1990-2017. Global economic losses due to extreme climate-related events in 2017 totalled at $327 billion, around triple the value for 2016. The clear majority of this increase in economic losses occurred in high-income countries, where losses relative to GDP increased from $1*44 per $1000 GDP to $5*58 per $1000 GDP. Economic losses in low-income countries decreased slightly between 2016, and 2017, both in absolute terms and per unit GDP. However, whereas nearly half of the losses in highincome countries were insured, just 1% of low-income country losses were insured.	1
Indicator 4.2: investments in zero-carbon energy and energy efficiency Headline finding: in 2017, proportional investment in zero-carbon energy and energy efficiency decreased as a proportion of total energy-system investment, whereas the proportion of fossil fuels increased. However, this decrease is in part due to the declining costs of renewables Indicator 4.2 monitors global investment in zero-carbon energy, and in energy efficiency (both as a proportion of the total energy system, and in absolute terms; figure 21). All values reported are based on the value of the US dollar in 2017 (US$2017), with data sourced from the IEA.98-100 The methods and data sources for this indicator have not changed since the 2017 Lancet Countdown report,2  	1
and are outlined in detail there, and in the appendix. The IEA estimated that to maintain a 50% chance of limiting global average temperature rise to 2C, cumulative investment in the energy system from 2014 to 2035, must reach $53 trillion, with 50% of this being invested in zero-carbon energy and energy efficiency.101 Total investment in the global energy system reduced by 2% in real terms between 2016, and 2017. Investment in fossil fuels reduced slightly, because of lower investment in coal electricity generation capacity than previously (see indicator 4.3), but this reduction was offset to a large degree by increased investment in upstream oil and gas. Investment in zero-carbon energy also decreased because of a substantial reduction in new nuclear investment, but also because of a continuation of declining unit costs for renewables (eg, solar photovoltaics decreased in cost by 15% between 2016, and 2017). Investment in energy efficiency continued to increase. However, overall, between 2016, and 2017, fossil fuels increased slightly as a proportion of total energy-system investment, whereas zero-carbon energy and energy efficiency decreased (from 33% to 32%).102	1
Indicator 4.3: investment in new coal capacity Headline finding: investment in new coal capacity reduced substantially in 2017, reaching its lowest level in at least 10 years, from a possible all-time peak in 2015 Indicator 4.3 tracks global annual investment in the most CO-intensive method of generating electricity--the combustion of coal in coal-fired power plants. We used data from the IEA to present an index of annual investment in new coal capacity from 2006 to 2017 (figure 22). The methods and data sources (the IEA) for this indicator have not changed since the 2017 Lancet Countdown report,2 and are outlined in detail there and in the appendix.99 2503	1
Investment in new coal-fired electricity-generating capacity reduced substantially in 2017, continuing the trend in 2016 (figure 22). This decrease is largely the result of fewer new plants being commissioned in China and India. Investment in new coal capacity is at its lowest in more than 10 years, with the IEA suggesting that investment in coal-fired capacity reached an all-time peak in 2015.103 In addition, the retirement of existing coal-fired capacity offset nearly half of new capacity additions in 2017.102	1
Indicator 4.4: employment in renewable and fossil-fuel energy industries Headline finding: in 2017, renewable energy provided 10*3 million jobs, an increase of 5*7% from 2016. Employment in fossil-fuel extraction industries also increased to 11 million, an 8% increase from 2016 As the low-carbon transition gathers pace, fossil fuelenergy industries and associated jobs will decline. Employ ment in some key fossil fuel industries, such as coal mining, have well documented effects on human health.2 However, in the place of these industries new low-carbon 2504	1
industries and employment opportunities, such as those in the renewable energy sector, will be stimulated. With appropriate planning and enabling policy, the transition of employment opportunities between high-carbon and lowcarbon industries could yield positive consequences for both the economy and human health. This indicator tracks global direct employment in fossilfuel extraction industries (coal mining and oil and gas exploration and production) and direct and indirect (supply chain) employment in renewable energy (figure 23). The data for this indicator are sourced from the International Renewable Energy Agency (renewables) and IBIS World (fossil fuel extraction).102,104,105 The number of direct and indirect jobs in the global renewable energy industry continues to increase, reaching 10*3 million in 2017 (a 5*7% increase from 2016). The solar photovoltaic sector overtook the bioenergy sector to become the largest employer in 2016, and saw a further 9% growth in 2017 (driven by China and India). Employment in biofuels increased for the first time since 2014 (a 12% increase in 2017 from 2016), because of increased production of ethanol and biodiesel (particularly in Brazil and the USA).105 By contrast to the trend of decreasing employment in the global fossil-fuel extractive industries (particularly in coal mining) established in 2011, employment in this industry rose by around 8% between 2016, and 2017, driven by reducing prices, industry consolidation, and the rise in automation.2 This rise is also driven by the coal mining sector, reflecting expansion due to a double-digit price increase. However, the decreasing trend will be likely to return as the low-carbon transition progresses.102 The data for fossil-fuel extraction employment for 2012-16 differ substantially from those presented in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report9 because of improved data collection methods and improved estimation of global coal-mining employment by IBISWorld. Further details on this indicator can be found in the appendix.	1
Indicator 4.5: funds divested from fossil fuels Headline finding: in 2017, the global value of funds committed to fossil fuel divestment was $428 billion, of which funds from health institutions accounted for $3*28 billion; these funds represent a cumulative sum of $5*88 trillion, with health institutions accounting for $33*6 billion Indicator 4.5 tracks the total global value of funds com mitted to divestment from fossil fuels, and the value of funds committed to divestment by health institutions. This evolving movement seeks to both remove the social licence of the fossil fuel industry and guard against the risk of losses due to stranded assets, by encouraging institutions and investors to commit to divest their assets invested in the industry. This approach is often contrasted with an approach that sees investors actively engage with the fossil fuel industry, for example, by looking to mandate a reduction in high-carbon activities through shareholder resolutions. These two approaches might not  	1
Indicator 4.6: fossil fuel subsidies Headline finding: in 2016, fossil fuel consumption subsidies continued to follow the trend established in 2013, and decreased to $267 billion (a 15% reduction from 2015) Section 3 of this report makes clear some of the cardio pulmonary consequences of fossil fuel combustion. Fossil fuel subsidies (both for consumption and production) artificially lower prices, promoting overconsumption and further exacerbating air pollution and its consequences for human health. This indicator tracks the global value of fossil-fuel consumption subsidies. Although these subsidies are intended to moderate energy costs for low-income con sumers, in practice, 65% of such subsidies in LMICs benefit the wealthiest 40% of the population.107 We note the continuation of the downward trend that began in 2013, with global fossil-fuel consumption subsidies reaching $267 billion in 2016 (figure 24).58 Increasing fossil fuel prices tend to increase subsidies as the difference between the market and regulated consumer price increases. For example, the doubling in oil price between 2009, and 2012, was the principal driver behind the increase in subsidies in these years. However, when fossil fuel prices decrease, the gap between market and regulated prices also narrows, allowing governments to review the use of such subsidies while keeping overall prices largely constant.58 Both factors were responsible for the declining trend between 2012, and 2015, which continued into 2016 with a further decrease in oil prices (to prices that had not been seen since 2002), and continuing subsidy reforms in the Middle East in particular.2,108 Although the Middle East  	1
be mutually exclusive, and might be most effective when employed in tandem.106 By the end of 2017, 826 organisations with cumulative assets worth at least $5*88 trillion, including 17 health organisations with assets of around $33*6 billion, had committed to divest, including the World Medical Association, Royal Australasian College of Physicians, and the Canadian Medical Association. Between 2016, and 2017, the annual value of new funds that were committed to divestment decreased from $1*24 trillion in 2016 to $428 billion in 2017. However, health institutions have divested at an increased rate, from $2*4 billion in 2016 to $3*28 billion in 2017, with the American Public Health Association, the Hospital Contributions Fund, and Medibank Australia as notable contributors. In the context of this indicator, divestment is broadly defined, and includes organisations that have committed to divest from one form of coal to those that have actively divested from all fossil fuel industries. Ultimately, the Lancet Countdown aims to analyse the amount of divest ment from different sectors. The methods and data for this indicator have not changed since the 2017 Lancet Countdown report;2 further details are available in the appendix.	1
continues to provide around 30% of total subsidies, their value decreased from around $120 billion in 2015 to $80 billion in 2016. As a result, subsidies for electricity consumption in 2016 were, for the first time since such data was collected, larger than those provided for oil consumption.58 The methods and data source (the IEA) for this indicator have not changed since the 2017 Lancet Countdown report,2 and are described in the report and in the appendix.58 However, the breakdown of subsidies by type of fuel for 2009-13, which was previously not available, is now included.	1
Indicator 4.7: coverage and strength of carbon pricing Headline finding: carbon pricing instruments in early 2018 continue to cover 13*1% of global anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions reached in 2017, but with average prices being around 20% higher than those of 2017 Adequately pricing carbon (both in terms of strength, coverage, and integration of varying mechanisms) could potentially be the single most important intervention in responding to climate change. This indicator tracks the 2505	1
extent to which carbon pricing instruments are applied around the world as a proportion of total greenhouse-gas emissions, and the weighted average carbon price instruments provided (table). The same methods and data source (the World Bank Carbon Pricing Dashboard)109 were used for this indicator as in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report,2 and are further detailed in the appendix. The coverage of carbon pricing instruments re mained at 13*1% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions between 2017, and 2018, implemented through 42 national and 25 subnational instruments (appendix). The range of carbon prices across instruments remains vast (from <$1 per tonnes of CO equivalent in Poland and Ukraine to $139 per tCOe in Sweden), although weighted-average prices in early 2018 were 20% higher than those of 2017 (both across instruments and total global anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emis sions). For example, the price under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS; the largest carbon pricing instrument in the world) rose by $10 per tCOe between Dec 1, 2017, and April 1, 2018. With the addition of instruments scheduled for implementation, including the Chinese national ETS (replacing the existing subnational pilots), around 20% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will be subject to a carbon price.110 Further carbon pricing instruments are under consideration in several other national and subnational jurisdictions.	1
Indicator 4.8: use of carbon pricing revenues Headline finding: revenues from carbon pricing instruments increased 50% between 2016, and 2017, reaching $33 billion, with $14*5 billion allocated to further climate change mitigation activities Indicator 4.8 tracks the total government revenue from carbon pricing instruments and how this income is subsequently allocated. Government revenue from carbon pricing instruments can be put to a range of uses. Revenue can be invested in climate change mitigation or adaptation activities, be explicitly recycled for other purposes (eg, enabling the reduction of other taxes or levies), or simply contribute towards general government funds. 2506	1
Government revenue generated from carbon pricing instruments in 2017, totalled at nearly $33 billion, a 50% increase from the $22 billion generated in 2016. This increase is driven by a combination of increasing carbon pricing coverage in 2017 (with the introduction of the Ontario, Canada, ETS and carbon taxes in Alberta, Canada, in Chile, and in Colombia), an increase in average prices, and an increasing share of ETS permits bought at auction (rather than distributed for free).110 The absolute value of allocated funds has increased in all four categories, with the proportional share remaining largely stable between 2016, and 2017. The most marked change is a shift of approximately 4% of total revenue from revenue recycling to mitigation (appendix). This is in part driven by Colombia and particularly Ontario, which have committed to allocate all revenues from their newly-introduced instruments to further mitigation action. Data on revenue generated are provided on the World Bank's Carbon Pricing Dashboard, with revenue allo cation information obtained from various sources. Only instruments with revenue estimates and with revenue received by the administering authority before redis tribution are considered. The methods and principle data source (the World Bank)109,110 for this indicator have not changed since the 2017 Lancet Countdown report,2 and are described there and in the appendix, along with further detail on the various sources used to obtain this global picture of carbon pricing revenues and data for individual instruments.	1
Conclusion Section 4 has presented indicators on the costs of the broader impacts of climate change and the economics and finance that underpin climate mitigation. The results of these indicators suggest that the beginning of an economic transition towards a low-carbon economy is underway, with many of the trends identified in the 2017 report2 continuing. These trends can be interpreted as early signs of a broader transformation, with important health benefits to follow, as a result of growing investment in low-carbon technology and employment, a transition away from fossil fuels, and strengthened and expanded pricing of greenhouse-gas emissions. However, the indicators presented here also make clear that meeting the Paris Agreement commitments will require substantial further engagement from govern ments, private sector, and general public to increase the pace and scale of action.	1

report highlight the fact that action to date remains insufficient to achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement.112 Public and political engagement is central to increasing the speed and scale of action. Four domains of engagement are the focus of this final section: media, science, government, and corporate sector. Indicators have been identified for which annual and global data are available. Trends are largely reported from 2007, the year before the 2008 World Health Assembly in which member states of the UN resolved to protect human health from climate change.113 The media have a central role in public understanding and perceptions of climate change.114 The public rely on the news media to communicate and interpret climate change science, and to make sense of extreme weather events and assess actions by businesses and governments.115,116 The first indicator enriches the methods deployed in 2017, providing a global overview of media coverage of health and climate change from 62 newspapers, which is then complemented with expanded in-depth analysis of three national newspapers--the New York Times (NYT) in the USA, Le Monde in France, and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) in Germany. The second indicator focuses on science journals, the major source of evidence on health and climate change for the public, policy makers, and the business sector. The third indicator focuses on government engagement in health and climate change. Surveys point to wide spread public concern about climate change and its health related risks, with most people believing that their country has a responsibility to take action on climate change and that their government is not doing enough.117-119 This indicator captures high-level govern ment engagement by tracking references to health and climate change in the statements made by national governments at the annual UNGD of the UN General Assembly (UNGA). The UNGD is a unique international forum that provides all UN member states with the opportunity to address the UNGA on issues they consider important.120 The corporate sector is integral to the transition to a low-carbon economy, both through their business practices and by influencing political responses to climate change.121,122 Data for this new indicator come from the UN Global Compact (UNGC), in which com panies report annually on their progress on embedding environmental sustainability and SDGs into their business plans and activities.123,124	1
the content of media coverage through analysis of selected leading newspapers. Global media coverage of health and climate change increased by 42% between 2007, and 2017 (figure 25). This increase contrasts with global newspaper coverage of climate change alone. Although climate change coverage declined at an average rate of 1*25% per year, coverage of health and climate change increased by an average of 4% per year. Marked regional differences can be observed, with more extensive media coverage in southeast Asia driving the global trend (figure 25). Southeast Asian coverage accounts for a large proportion (42-64%) of global coverage across the same period. Moreover, the overall increase in global coverage is driven by increased coverage in this WHO region, with the Times of India, India's largest English-language newspaper, contributing disproportionately to the global total.125 English-language newspapers occupy a particularly central place in the Indian media by communicating the perspectives and priorities of political and business elites.126,127 Methods and data sources for this indicator are described in full in the Lancet Countdown's 2017 report2 and in the appendix. Analysis has been expanded greatly, from 24 newspapers in 2017, to 62 newspapers in 2018. The second component of indicator 5.1 focuses on three major national newspapers that form part of the elite news media, which is seen to have a pivotal role in shaping public and political responses to climate change.128 Coverage of health and climate change increased in all three newspapers (figure 26). Between 2009 and 2017, the number of articles increased by 200% in FAZ, 133% in the NYT, and 18% in Le Monde. However, health remains marginal to wider climate change coverage (figure 26). Of the climate change articles published in 2017 in the NYT and in FAZ, only 2% referred to health and climate change; in Le Monde, the proportion was slightly higher, at 8%. Media attention has been characterised by peaks linked to climate change action at the global level, and to the UNFCCC COPs in particular.2 Content analysis of the three newspapers points to marked national differences in coverage. In European newspapers, the proportion of articles explaining and 2507	1

justifying why climate change is a public health issue declined over the period from 2007 to 2017, with a parallel increase in those highlighting the health dimensions of national climate change interventions. By contrast, in the NYT, most (92%) articles referring to both health and climate did so without linking the two topics. For example, the NYT referred separately to US health-care reforms (Obamacare) and US disengage ment from the Paris Agreement. Such articles are therefore not included among those linking health and climate change (figure 26). In European newspapers, health and climate change are most frequently covered in news sections--for example, as an environmental issue (Le Monde) and an economic issue (FAZ). However, in the NYT, health and climate change appear less frequently as news items and more frequently within the opinions section. The distinctive patterns of US media coverage of climate change have also been noted elsewhere.129 Methods and data sources are described in full in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report2 and in the appendix. The analysis has been enhanced both by the addition of a third national newspaper (the NYT) and by examining media engagement in health and climate change in the context of the wider coverage of climate change; further analyses are also presented in the appendix.	1
Indicator 5.2: coverage of health and climate change in scientific journals Headline finding: coverage of health and climate change increased by 182% in scientific journals between 2007, and 2017 Between 2007, and 2017, more than 2500 scientific articles examined the links between climate change and 2508	1
health. Just under half (47%) presented new research. The remainder comprised research-related articles (eg, research reviews, editorials, comments, and viewpoints), with research reviews making up the majority (55%) of these articles. The slight decline in scientific output on health and climate change between 2016, and 2017, is the result of fewer research-related publications than previously (appendix). As in previous years, scientific interest in health and climate change in 2017 was focused on America and Europe. More than a third (35%) of the papers concentrated on climate change and health in America, with just under 30% of all papers concerned with North America only. A further 25% focused on countries in Europe. Of the 20% of articles relating to the Western Pacific region, half focused solely on China. Less than 10% of papers related to health and climate change related to Africa (n=23) and southeast Asia (n=18), a region that includes India and Bangladesh. With respect to health outcomes, infectious diseases (particularly dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases) were the most common health focus (24%). Although this analysis points to increasing scientific engagement in health and climate change over the past decade, the area is marginal to climate change science. Of the 43 000 articles published in 2017 in the general area of climate change, only 4% made any link to health, and less than 1% (n=265) had a specific focus on health and climate change. Methods and data sources are explained in full in the Lancet Countdown's 2017 report2 and in the appendix. In addition to updating the analysis to include the date of 2017, this year's report also explores the type of scientific output (research or research-related) and the volume of outputs relating to climate change more broadly.	1
Indicator 5.3: engagement in health and climate change in the UN General Assembly Headline finding: from 2007 to 2017, national statements in the UNGD have increasingly linked climate change and health In this subsection we present trends from 1970 to 2017, looking separately at references to health, climate change, and health and climate change (figure 27). Although both health and climate change have been central focuses of the UNGD for an extended period, joint references to health and climate change did not truly begin to rise until 2000. Since 2007, trends in engagement in health and climate change have broadly matched the separate trends for climate change and health. Two spikes in engagement are apparent; in 2009-10, 20% of countries referenced health and climate change as linked issues, a sharp increase associated with the build-up to the UNFCCC's COP15. The second, larger, spike in 2014, coincided with the transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the SDGs and the lead-up to the UNFCCC's COP21. In that year, almost a  	1
Indicator 5.4: engagement in health and climate change in the corporate sector Headline finding: engagement with health and climate change has remained low among companies within the UNGC This new indicator tracks engagement with health and climate change among the 12 000 companies signed up to the UNGC, the world's largest corporate sus tainability initiative.131 Established to address gaps in the global governance of corporations, the UNGC seeks a more sustainable and inclusive global economy.132 The ten principles of the UNGC relate to human rights,  	1
quarter of all governments referenced the health impacts of climate change. Since 2014, a decline in engagement with health and climate change in the UNGD has been observed, with only 12% of the 196 UN member states referring to the two issues together in 2017. By contrast, a substantial majority of states referred to climate change (>75%) in their 2017 UNGD statement. Marked global and national differences in the attention given to health and climate change exist. Countries in the Western Pacific region are the most likely to refer to climate change and health links in their UNGD statements, with around 40% doing so in 2017. For example, Tuvalu's statement notes that "the impacts of climate change pose the most immediate, fundamental and far-reaching threat [...] to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health". The Australian statement discusses how SDGs, the Paris Agreement, and the Sendai Framework provide a blueprint for global action in areas such as climate change, diseases (including malaria), and resource management. The Cambodian Government also stated that "the 2030 Agenda is inextricably linked to many of the issues that perturb the world today, the most pressing being climate change, which is not only a direct threat in itself but is also a multiplier of many other threats--from poverty, diseases and food insecurity, to mass migrations and regional conflicts". The text for individual GD statements is available as part of the UN General Debate Corpus.130 Western Pacific regional engagement is driven by the Pacific Island states. In 2017, as in previous years, the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) were pro minent among the countries referring to health and climate change in their UNGD addresses. Nauru, the Maldives, the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, St Kitts and Nevis, and Vanuatu all discussed climate change and health links. By contrast, engagement was lowest in Europe and North America. Methods and data sources are explained in full in the Lancet Countdown's 2017 report2 and in the appendix. This year's analysis reports on the proportion of countries referring to health and climate change rather than the number of references; for continuity with the 2017 report, trends relating to the number of references are provided in the appendix, together with additional analyses.	1
working conditions, and environmental responsibility. Companies report annually on their implementation in Communication of Progress reports (CPs) that are made publicly available. Our analysis focuses on 2011-17, because very few CPs are publicly available before 2011 (appendix). The proportion of companies referring separately and jointly to health and climate change in their annual CPs indicates relatively high engagement in health and in climate change as separate issues; across the period 2011-17, 55-60% of the reports engage with health and around 45% with climate change. By contrast, less than one in seven reports refer conjointly to health and climate change (appendix). There are no spikes in engagement related to other UN initiatives, including the launch of the SDGs, COP21, or the 2015 Paris Agreement. There are, however, marked differences in engagement by corporate sector. Engagement is highest among telecommunication companies, in which more than 40% of CPs made reference to the intersection of climate change and health (appendix). The UNGC has been subject to critique, including of its voluntary status, limited participant base, and inability to control the environmental externalities generated by the corporate sector.133-135 Nonetheless, as a platform for developing and promoting sustainable policies and practices, the UNGC represents the largest corporate citizenship programme to date.132 The new indicator is based on the application of a keyword search in the text corpus of CPs submitted in English; in total, 48% (n=15 220) of CPs from 129 countries were analysed. Climate change-related terms were searched for the 25 words before and after a reference to a public health-related term. Methods and data sources are explained in full in the appendix. Because companies are listed in one country, but often operate across multiple countries both directly and via subsidiaries, analyses by WHO region are not given here, however, they can be found in the appendix. 2509	1
Conclusion Section 5 of this report has presented indicators of public and political engagement, which are crucial to trans formational action on climate change. The barriers to action on health and climate change are predominantly societal and not technical, with public and political engagement therefore holding the key to accelerating the pace and scale of action.1 Three conclusions can be drawn from this analysis of engagement in the media, science, UN, and corporate sector. First, engagement in health and climate change has increased in the media, science, and the UNGD over the past decade. The upward trend underlines the role of the UN, particularly through the UNFCCC and its COPs, in mobilising engagement. For example, spikes in the indicators around COP15 (2009) and COP21 (2015) were observed. The years that follow tend to see a decline in engagement. The exception to this broad pattern is the corporate sector, in which evidence for companies within the UNGC points to little change in engagement in health and climate change. Second, although overall engagement has increased over the past decade, engagement remains partial and uneven. Rather than reflecting a process of global mobilisation, the upward trend is being driven by individual regions and countries. The increase in global media attention is the result of increased coverage by newspapers in southeast Asia and by the Indian press in particular. With respect to political engagement, SIDS are using the global platform of the UNGD to draw attention to the health impacts of climate change. Within the scientific domain, overall trends again reflect uneven engagement. In this domain, however, increased engagement has been driven by research focusing on health and climate change in high-income and highemitting countries. By contrast, very few studies focus on Africa and southeast Asia, regions bearing the brunt of the health impacts of climate change. Third, although engagement in health and climate change has increased over the past year, this engagement represents a very small part of public and political engagement in climate change. Across the media, science, government, and the corporate sector, climate change is being framed in ways that largely ignore its health dimensions. Thus, analyses of national news papers and scientific journals indicate that less than 5% of climate change coverage relates to health. Analysis of the intergovernmental forum of the UNGD suggests that climate change and health are largely represented as separate issues, with much less attention given to them as interconnected phenomena. Similarly, a high pro portion of companies within the UNGC refer separately to health and climate change in their annual reports; however, only a small minority make links between health and climate change. Taken together, these conclusions point to increasing engagement in the health impacts of climate change, 2510	1
Conclusion: the Lancet Countdown in 2018 The Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change monitors progress on health and climate change across five domains: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerabilities; adaptation, planning, and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; finance and economics; and public and political engagement. The collaboration is committed to an iterative and open process, and will continue to develop the methods and data sources its indicators draw on, publishing annually in The Lancet through to 2030. In 2018, many of the global trends previously identified accelerated, both in terms of the health impacts of climate change, and the mitigation and adaptation interventions being implemented around the world. The first section of the report made clear that vulnerable populations are continually exposed to more severe climate hazards, with indicators reporting 157 million heatwave exposure events for such groups in 2017, more than 153 billion hours of labour lost due to rising temperatures, and that climatic conditions are at their most suitable for the transmission of dengue fever virus since 1950. Section 2 explored the various ways in which ministries of health, cities, and health systems are planning to enhance resilience and adaptation, providing more detailed insight into the quality and comprehensiveness of these strategies, and highlighted the fact that only 3*8% of adaptation funds available for development were allocated specifically for public health. Although more than 2*9 million premature deaths were caused by ambient pollution from PM* globally in 2015, promising trends reported in sections 3 and 4 showed a continued phase-out of coal-fired power, accelerated deployment of renewable energy, and continued divestment from fossil fuels, which should help to reduce premature mortality from air pollution. Indicators in the final section pointed to the same conclusions--that engagement in health and climate change is increasing, enabling this engagement to be an important driver of policy change globally. Four key messages emerge from the 41 indicators of the Lancet Countdown's 2018 report. First, present day changes in labour capacity, vector-borne disease, and food security provide early warning of compounded and overwhelming impacts expected if temperature continues to rise. Trends in climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerabilities show an unacceptably high risk for the current and future health of populations across the world. Second, slow progress in reducing emissions and building adaptive capacity threatens both human lives and the viability of the national health systems they depend on, with the potential to disrupt core publichealth infrastructure and overwhelm health services. Third, despite these delays, trends in a number of sectors are helping to generate the beginning of a low-carbon  	1
transition, and clearly the nature and scale of the response to climate change will be the determining factor in shaping the health of nations for centuries to come. And fourth, ensuring a widespread understanding of climate change as a central public-health issue will be vital in delivering an accelerated response, with the health profession beginning to rise to this challenge. Taken as a whole, the indicators and data presented in the Lancet Countdown's 2018 report provide great cause for concern, with the pace of climate change outweighing the urgency of the response. Despite this concerning trend, exciting trends in key areas for health, including the phase-out of coal, the deployment of healthier, cleaner modes of transport, and health system adaptation, give justification for cautious optimism. Regardless, the way in which these indicators of impact and response progress up until 2030 will clearly shape the health of nations for centuries to come.

The Lancet Countdown is an international, multi disciplinary collaboration, dedicated to monitoring the evolving health profile of climate change, and providing an inde pendent assessment of the delivery of com mitments made by governments worldwide under the Paris Agreement. The 2019 report presents an annual update of 41 indicators across five key domains: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation, plan ning, and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. The report represents the findings and consensus of 35 leading academic insti tutions and UN agencies from every continent. Each year, the methods and data that underpin the Lancet Countdown's indicators are further developed and improved, with updates described at each stage of this report. The collaboration draws on the world-class expertise of climate scientists; ecologists; mathemati cians; engineers; energy, food, and transport experts; economists; social and political scientists; public health professionals; and doctors, to generate the quality and diversity of data required. The science of climate change describes a range of possible futures, which are largely dependent on the degree of action or inaction in the face of a warming world. The policies implemented will have far-reaching effects in determining these eventualities, with the indicators tracked here monitoring both the present-day effects of climate change, as well as the worldwide response. Understanding these decisions as a choice between one of two pathways--one that continues with the business as usual response and one that redirects to a future that remains ``well below 2C''--helps to bring the importance of recognising the effects of climate change and the necessary response to the forefront. Evidence provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the International Energy Agency, and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration clarifies the degree and magnitude of climate change experienced today and contextualises these two pathways.	1
The world has observed a 1C temperature rise above pre-industrial levels, with feedback cycles and polar amplification resulting in a rise as high as 3C in north western Canada.1,2 Eight of the ten hottest years on record have occurred in the past decade.3 Such rapid change is primarily driven by the combustion of fossil fuels, consumed at a rate of 171 000 kg of coal, 116 000 000 L of gas, and 186 000 L of oil per s.4-6 Progress in mitigating this threat is intermittent at best, with carbon dioxide emissions continuing to rise in 2018.7 Importantly, many of the indicators contained in this report suggest the world is following this "business as usual" pathway. The carbon intensity of the energy system has remained unchanged since 1990 (indicator 3.1.1), and from 2016 to 2018, total primary energy supply from coal increased by 1*7%, reversing a previously recorded downward trend (indicator 3.1.2). Correspondingly, the health-care sector is responsible for about 4*6% of global emissions, a value which is steadily rising across most major eco nomies (indicator 3.6). Global fossil fuel consumption subsidies increased by 50% over the past 3 years, reaching a peak of almost US$430 billion in 2018 (indicator 4.4.1). A child born today will experience a world that is more than four degrees warmer than the pre-industrial average, with climate change impacting human health from infancy and adolescence to adulthood and old age. Across the world, children are among the worst affected by climate change. Downward trends in global yield poten tial for all major crops tracked since 1960 threaten food production and food security, with infants often the worst affected by the potentially permanent effects of undernutrition (indicator 1.5.1). Children are among the most susceptible to diarrhoeal disease and experience the most severe effects of dengue fever. Trends in climate suitability for disease transmission are particularly concerning, with nine of the ten most suitable years for the transmission of dengue fever on record occurring since 2000 (indicator 1.4.1). Similarly, since an early 1980s baseline, the number of days suitable for Vibrio (a pathogen responsible for part of the burden of diarrhoeal disease) has doubled, and global suitability  	1
for coastal Vibrio cholerae has increased by 9*9% (indicator 1.4.1). Through adolescence and beyond, air pollution-- principally driven by fossil fuels, and exacerbated by climate change--damages the heart, lungs, and every other vital organ. These effects accumulate over time, and into adulthood, with global deaths attributable to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2*5) remaining at 2*9 million in 2016 (indicator 3.3.2) and total global air pollution deaths reaching 7 million.8 Later in life, families and livelihoods are put at risk from increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions, with women among the most vulnerable across a range of social and cultural contexts. Globally, 77% of countries experienced an increase in daily population exposure to wildfires from 2001-14 to 2015-18 (indicator 1.2.1). India and China sustained the largest increases, with an increase of over 21 million exposures in India and 17 million exposures in China over this time period. In low-income countries, almost all economic losses from extreme weather events are uninsured, placing a particularly high burden on individuals and households (indicator 4.1). Temperature rise and heatwaves are increasingly limiting the labour capacity of various populations. In 2018, 133*6 billion potential work hours were lost globally, 45 billion more than the 2000 baseline, and southern areas of the USA lost 15-20% of potential daylight work hours during the hottest month of 2018 (indicator 1.1.4). Populations aged 65 years and older are particularly vulnerable to the health effects of climate change, and especially to extremes of heat. From 1990 to 2018, populations in every region have become more vul nerable to heat and heatwaves, with Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean remaining the most vulnerable (indicator 1.1.1). In 2018, these vulnerable popu lations experienced 220 million heatwave exposures globally, breaking the previous record of 209 million set in 2015 (indicator 1.1.3). Already faced with the challenge of an ageing population, Japan had 32 million heat wave exposures affecting people aged 65 years and older in 2018, the equivalent of almost every person in this age group experiencing a heatwave. Finally, although difficult to quantify, the downstream risks of climate change, such as migration, poverty exacerbation, violent conflict, and mental illness, affect people of all ages and all nationalities. A business as usual trajectory will result in a funda mentally altered world, with the indicators described providing a glimpse of the implications of this pathway. The life of every child born today will be profoundly affected by climate change. Without accelerated inter vention, this new era will come to define the health of people at every stage of their lives.	1
2C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1*5C." In a world that matches this ambition, a child born today would see the phase-out of all coal in the UK and Canada by their sixth and 11th birthday; they would see France ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by their 21st birthday; and they would be 31 years old by the time the world reaches net-zero in 2050, with the UK's recent commitment to reach this goal one of many to come. The changes seen in this alternate pathway could result in cleaner air, safer cities, and more nutritious food, coupled with renewed investment in health systems and vital infrastructure. This second path-- which limits the global average temperature rise to "well below 2C"--is possible, and would transform the health of a child born today for the better, right the way through their life. Considering the evidence available in the 2019 indicators, such a transition could be beginning to unfold. Despite a small increase in coal use in 2018, in key countries such as China, it continued to decrease as a share of electricity generation (indicator 3.1.2). Correspondingly, renewables accounted for 45% of global growth in power generation capacity that year, and low-carbon electricity reached a high of 32% of global electricity in 2016 (indicator 3.1.3). Global per capita use of electric vehicles increased by 20*6% between 2015 and 2016, and now represents 1*8% of China's total transportation fuel use (indicator 3.4). Improvements in air pollution seen in Europe from 2015 to 2016, could result in a reduction of Years of Life Lost (YLL) worth 5*2 billion annually, if this reduction remained constant across a lifetime (indicator 4.2). In several cases, the economic savings from a healthier and more productive workforce, with fewer health-care expenses, will cover the initial investment costs of these interventions. Similarly, cities and health systems are becoming more resilient to the effects of climate change; about 50% of countries and 69% of cities surveyed reported efforts to conduct national health adaptation plans or climate change risk assessments (indicators 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.1.3). These plans are now being implemented, with the number of countries providing climate services to the health sector increasing from 55 in 2018 to 70 in 2019 (indicator 2.2) and 109 countries reporting medium to high implementation of a national health emergency framework (indicator 2.3.1). Growing demand is coupled with a steady increase in health adaptation spending, which represents 5% (13 billion) of total adaptation funding in 2018 and has increased by 11*8% over the past 12 months (indicator 2.4). This increase is in part funded by growing revenues from carbon pricing mechanisms, with a 30% increase to US$43 billion in funds raised between 2017 and 2018 (indicator 4.4.3). However, current progress is inadequate, and despite the beginnings of the transition described, the indicators published in the Lancet Countdown's 2019 report are suggestive of a world struggling to cope with warming that is occurring faster than governments are able, or willing to	1

respond. Opportunities are being missed, with the Green Climate Fund yet to receive projects specifically focused on improving climate-related public health, despite the fact that in other forums, leaders of small island developing states are recognising the links between health and climate change (indicator 5.3). In response, the generation that will be most affected by climate change has led a wave of school strikes across the world. Bold new approaches to policy making, research, and business are needed in order to change course. An unprecedented challenge demands an unprecedented response, and it will take the work of the 7*5 billion people currently alive to ensure that the health of a child born today is not defined by a changing climate.	1
independent research collaboration, the partner ship brings together 35 academic institutions and UN agencies from every continent. The indicators and report presented here represent the work and consensus of climate scientists; geographers; engineers; energy, food and transport experts; economists; social and political scientists; public health professionals; and doctors. The 41 indicators of the 2019 report span five domains: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and their health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement (panel 1).	1
This collaboration builds on three decades of work around the world, which has sought to understand and assess the scientific pathways that link climate change to public health.13 In 2016, The Lancet Countdown launched a global consultation process, actively seeking input from experts and policy makers on which aspects of these pathways could and should be tracked as part of a global monitoring process. A large number of indicators were initially considered, and then narrowed down into the five indicator domains and published, along with a request for further input.19 The final set of indicators were selected on the basis of the presence of credible scientific links to climate change and to public health; the presence of reliable and regularly updated data, available across temporal and geographic scales; and the importance of this information to policy makers.20 Overcoming the data and capacity limitations inherent in this field, and remaining adaptable to a rapidly evolving scientific landscape has required a commitment to an open and iterative approach. This has meant that the analysis provided in each subsequent annual report replaces analyses from previous years, with methods and datasets being continuously improved and updated. In every case, a full description of these changes is provided in the appendix, which is intended as an essential companion to the main report, rather than a more traditional addendum. The 2019 report presents 12 months of work refining the metrics and analysis. In addition to updating each indicator with the information collated over the course of 1 year, three key developments have occurred. Firstly, methodologies and datasets have been strength ened for indicators that capture heat and heatwaves; labour capacity loss; the lethality of weather-related disasters; terrestrial food security and under nutrition; health adaptation planning and vulnerability assessments; air pollution mortality in cities; household fuel use for cooking; and qualitative validation of engagement from the media and national governments in health and climate change. Secondly, the geographical and temporal coverage has been expanded for indicators that capture marine food	1
Human wellbeing, and the stability of local communities, health systems, and governments, all depend on how they interface with the changing global climate.9,10 Across the world, an average temperature increase of 1C from a pre-industrial baseline1,2 has already resulted in extreme climatic and environmental changes, with severe storms and floods, prolonged heatwaves and droughts, new and emerging infectious diseases,11-13 and compounding threats to food security. Left unabated, climate change will define the health profile of current and future generations, will challenge already overwhelmed health systems, and undermine progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and universal health coverage (UHC).14,15 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1*5C emphasises the scale of the response required: global annual emissions must halve by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050 to limit warming to 1*5C, while recognising that no amount of climate change is considered safe.2 Placing health at the centre of this transition will yield enormous dividends for the public and the economy, with cleaner air, safer cities, and healthier diets. Analysis focused on one of these path ways--cleaner air through more sustainable transport and power generation systems-- suggests that the economic gains from the health benefits of meeting the Paris Agreement substantially outweigh the cost of any intervention by a ratio of 1*45 to 2*45, resulting in trillions of dollars of savings worldwide.16 When the health benefits of any increase in physical activity that results from modal shift are taken into account, the economic gains increase significantly.17 These analyses complement an assessment from outside the health sector, which estimates that a robust response to climate change could yield more than US$26 trillion and 65 million new low-carbon jobs by 2030, compared with a business as usual scenario.18 Monitoring this transition from threat to opportunity and demonstrating the benefits of realising the Paris Agreement is precisely why the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change was formed. As an international,	1

security; national adaptation planning for health; health vulnerability assessments; climate information services for health; the carbon intensity of the energy system; access to clean energy; and Chinese media engagement in health and climate change. Finally, new indicators were constructed that capture exposure to wildfires; the transmission suitability for V cholerae; the benefits and harms of air conditioning; emissions from livestock and crop production; global health-care system emissions; economic cost of air pollution; and individual online engagement in health and climate change. Ongoing research aims to establish indicators for concepts that are inherently difficult to quantify, such as the mental health effects of climate change. Three indicators included in previous years--covering migra tion, global health adaptation funding, and academic  	1
engagement in health and climate change--are not presented in the 2019 report, as further work is being done to improve their methods and to ensure that they are able to be sustainably reproduced in the future. These indicators will be re-introduced in subsequent years. For the second consecutive year, these changes represent substantial updates to most of the indicators, and knowledge is increasing at a pace that will only accelerate as funding and capacity from the Wellcome Trust and the Lancet Countdown's partners grows. Going forward, the collaboration will seek to further strengthen its scientific processes, continuously review its indicators, and produce internally coherent frameworks to guide the development of new indicators. To this end, The Lancet Countdown remains open to new input and participation from experts and academic institutions willing to build on the analysis published in this report. 1839	1
Health and climate change in 2018 The 2019 report discusses the worsening health effects of climate change. Over 220 million additional exposures to heatwaves (with each exposure defined as one person aged 65 years or older exposed to one heatwave) occurred in 2018, compared with a 1986-2005 climatological baseline, higher than ever previously tracked (indicator 1.1.3). This occurred at a time when demo graphic vulnerability to these extremes continued to increase across every region (indicator 1.1.1), and the warming experienced by human populations reached four times that of the global average temperature rise (indicator 1.1.2). Around the world, resultant losses in labour capacity were reported, with several southern states in the USA losing as much as 15-20% of daylight capacity (for workers in construc tion and agriculture; indicator 1.1.4). The effects of this warming extended to other extremes, with 152 countries experiencing a marked increase in the daily popu lation exposures to wildfires compared with baseline (indicator 1.2.1). Regarding infectious diseases, 2018 was ranked second on record as having the most suitable conditions for the transmission of diarrhoeal disease and wound infections from Vibrio bacteria, and 9 of the past 10 most suitable years for the transmission of dengue fever have occurred since 2000 (indicator 1.4.1). The distribution of exposure and effect is not equal, with several indicators reporting greater changes in low-income settings than in high-income settings--for example, in parts of Africa, South-East Asia, and the Western Pacific (indicator 4.1). Despite these worsening effects, the carbon intensity of the global energy system has remained flat since 1990 (indicator 3.1.1) and use of clean fuels for household services is stagnating (indicator 3.2). Perhaps of greatest concern is that total primary energy supply from coal increased by 1*7% from 2016 to 2018, reversing a previously observed downward trend (indicator 3.1.2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the energy sector, far from falling, rose by 2*6% from 2016 to 2018 (indicator 3.1.1). Global fossil fuel subsidies rose to US$427 billion in 2018--a 33% rise from 2017 (indicator 4.4.1)--and emis sions associated with health care now represent 4*6% of global emissions, rising across most major economies (indicator 3.6). Fossil fuel use continues to contribute to ambient air pollution, which resulted in 2*9 million premature deaths globally in 2016 (indicator 3.3.2). Although these emerging health impacts and the lack of a coordinated global response portray a bleak picture, they also mask important promising trends. Several encouraging trends continue, such as reductions in investment in new coal capacity and a fall in coal as a share of total electricity generation (indicators 4.3.1 and 3.1.2). Renewable energy accounted for 45% of total growth in 2018 (indicator 3.1.3), and low-carbon electricity repre sented an impressive 32% share of total global electricity generation in 2016 (indicator 3.1.3). The reduction in air pollution recorded in Europe from 2015 to 2016, if maintained across a lifetime, could result in an annual 1840	1
reduction in YLL valued at 5*2 billion (indicator 4.2). These changes are reinforced by new commitments from the UK21 and France22 to reach net zero by 2050, with other countries soon expected to follow. Notably, the world is beginning to adapt, with 50% of countries and 69% of cities surveyed reporting the completion or undertaking of a climate change risk assessment or adaptation plan (indicators 2.1.2 and 2.1.3). Increasingly, these plans are being implemented, with 70 countries providing meteorological services targeted towards the health sector in 2019 and 109 countries achieving medium to high implementation of a national health emergency framework (indicators 2.2 and 2.3.1). In the health sector, the UK's Royal College of General Practitioners and Faculty of Public Health divested their fossil fuel investments in 2018, joining many uni versities, non-governmental organisations, and pension funds from across the world (indicator 4.3.4). Alongside this, new analysis suggests a growing and more sophisticated recognition of the health benefits of the response to climate change in the media (indicator 5.1). Many of the trends identified in the 2019 Lancet Countdown report are deeply concerning. Greenhousegas emissions continue to rise. Nevertheless, the continued expansion of renewable energy, increased investment in health system adaptation, improvements in sustainable transport, and growth in public engagement suggests ongoing reasons for cautious optimism. At a time when the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is preparing to review commitments under the Paris Agreement in 2020, accelerated ambition and action is required in order to meet the world commitment to remaining "well below 2C".23	1
Section 1: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerabilities Climate change and human health are interconnected in a myriad of complex ways.13 Building on the Lancet Countdown's previous work, section 1 of the 2019 report continues to track quantitative metrics along pathways of population vulnerability, exposure, and health outcomes that are indicative of the cost to human health of climate change, and thus of the urgent need to reduce greenhousegas emissions. The impacts tracked here in turn motivate and guide climate change adaptation (section 2) and mitigation (section 3) interventions. Changes in warming and weather events are not evenly distributed across the globe, and some populations, including children, the elderly, and outdoor workers, are more vulnerable than others. Efforts to track the unequal effects of climate change are reflected through indicators that focus on particularly vulnerable populations, and low-income and middle-income countries expe riencing the worst of these effects. Although it is certainly true that the effects of climate change vary by geographical location and that these effects will not always be negative, any so-called positive effects  	1
are often short-term in nature, and quickly outweighed by other exposures. One such example is seen in Australia, where any benefit that might have been gained from CO2 fertilisation is both small and largely outweighed by greater climate variation, with crop yields now stalling as harvests are increasingly affected by more frequent drought.24 Even disregarding the negative effects of temperature change, any CO2 fertilisation benefits are likely to be short-term, as rising CO2 concentrations will negatively affect grain quality.25-28 For 2019, a new metric tracking exposure to wildfires has been added (indicator 1.2.1), as has an expansion of climate suitability of infectious diseases (indicator 1.4.1), to now include V cholerae transmission risk. These indi cators portray a world which is rapidly warming, where environ mental and social systems are already being exposed to the effects of climate change, which are subsequently affecting human health.	1
Indicator 1.1: health and heat The most immediate and direct impact of a changing global climate on human health is seen in the steady increase in global average temperature, and the increased frequency, intensity, and duration of extremes of heat. The pathophysiological consequences of heat exposure in humans are well documented and understood, and include heat stress and heat stroke, acute kidney injury, exacerbation of congestive heart failure,29 and increased risk of interpersonal,30 and collective violence.31 In par ticular, during periods of extreme heat, young children have a greater risk of electrolyte imbalance, fever, respiratory disease, and kidney disease.32 Four indicators that are related to heat are discussed here, tracking the vulnerabilities, exposures, and labour implications of a warming world.	1
Indicator 1.1.1: vulnerability to extremes of heat--headline finding: vulnerability to extremes of heat continues to rise among older populations in every region of the world, with the Western Pacific, South-East Asia and African regions all seeing an increase in vulnerability of more than 10% since 1990 Certain populations are more vulnerable to the health effects of heat than others. Older populations are particularly vulnerable, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as diabetes and cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal disease).33 Outdoor workers, while younger and healthier overall, are also vulnerable due to heightened exposure to heat and sunlight. This indicator presents a heat vulnerability index which ranges from 0 to 100 and includes the proportion of the population older than age 65 years, prevalence of chronic diseases, and proportion of the population living in urban areas, with the data and methods unchanged from previous years (appendix p 1). Populations older than age 65 years, in all regions of the world, are becoming increasingly vulnerable. However, the highest increase in vulnerability from  	1
1990 to 2017 has been seen in the Western Pacific (33*1% to 36*6%) and African (28*4% to 31*2%) regions. Overall, Europe remains the most vulnerable region to heat exposure (followed closely by the Eastern Mediter ranean region), due to its ageing population, high rates of urbanisation, and high prevalence of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and diabetes.	1
Indicator 1.1.2: health and exposure to warming--headline finding: human populations are concentrated in the areas most exposed to warming, experiencing a mean summer temperature change that is four times higher than the global average This indicator compares the population-weighted summer temperature change from a 1986-2005 baseline with the global average summer temperature change over the same period, using weather data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts,34 ERA-Interim project and population data from the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) Gridded Population of the World (GPWv4).35 Full details, along with an explanation of improvements for the 2019 report, which uses higher resolution climate and population data (0*5C grid instead of 0*75C grid) are provided (appendix p 3). The population-weighted temperatures continue to grow at a substantially faster pace than the global average, increasing the human health risk. The global average population-weighted temperature has risen by 0*8C from the 1986-2005 baseline to 2018, compared with a global average temperature rise of 0*2C over the course of the same time period.	1
Indicator 1.1.3: exposure of vulnerable populations to heatwaves--headline finding: in 2018, an increase of 220 million heatwave exposures affecting older populations was observed, breaking the previous record set in 2015. Japan alone experienced 32 million heatwave exposures, the equivalent of almost every person aged 65 years and older enduring effects of a heatwave in 2018 Heatwaves across the northern hemisphere made headlines in 2018, reaching new highs for a number of countries.36 The definition of a heatwave, the demographic data,35 and methods used here remain unchanged from previous reports (appendix pp 4).37 Each heatwave exposure event is defined as one heatwave experienced by one person older than age 65 years. This indicator was also improved with a higher resolution (0*5C grid instead of 0*75C grid). The change in heatwave exposure events relative to the 1986-2005 average are presented (figure 1). The increase in heatwave exposure events (220 million, which is 11 million more than the 2015 record) was due to a series of heat waves across India (45 million additional exposures); across central and northern Europe (31 million additional exposures in the EU); and across northeast Asia, where heatwaves affected Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Northern China. 32 million exposures affected people 1841	1
Indicator 1.1.4: change in labour capacity--headline finding: higher temperatures continue to affect people's ability to work. In 2018, 45 billion additional potential work hours were lost due to rising temperatures, compared with in the year 2000 General work productivity and ability to work are affected by temperature and humidity, which are both captured in the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) measurement. Labour productivity loss estimates for every degree increase of WBGT beyond 24C range from 0*8% to 5%.39	1
Indicator 1.2: health and extreme weather events Indicator 1.2.1: wildfires--headline finding: 152 of 196 countries saw an increase in annual daily population exposure to wildfires in 2015-18, compared with in 2001-04, with India alone experiencing an increase of 21 million annual daily exposures. This increase not only poses a threat to public health, but also results in major economic and social burdens in both high-income and low-income countries	1
Reduced labour productivity is often the first symptom of the health effects of heat, and, if not addressed, could lead to more severe health effects, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke. This indicator emphasises the important impact of climate change on labour capacity in vulnerable popu lations.40 It assigns work-fraction loss functions to different activity sectors (service, manufacturing, and agriculture), linking WBGT with the power (metabolic rate) typically expended by a worker within each of these three sectors. This is then coupled with the proportion of the population working within each of these three sectors to calculate potential work hours lost (WHL) by country. This indicator has been improved to include the effect of sunlight on the potential WHL by calculating the increase in WBGT using solar radiation data available from the ERA database (appendix pp 5-6).35,41,42 The global atmospheric temperature and humidity in 2018 were slightly more favourable for work than in 2017, but the upward trend of potential WHL since 2000 remains clear (figure 2). In 2018, 133*6 billion potential work hours were lost; 45 billion hours more than in 2000. Additionally, a map is presented of the equivalent potential annual full-time work lost in the sun and the shade (figure 3). Of note, for 300 Watts (W) work in the shade (typical for manufacturing), over 10% potential daily work hours were lost in densely populated regions such as south Asia. For 400 W work in the sun (typical for agriculture and construction), even workers in the southern parts of the USA (below a latitude of 34N, with Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas particularly affected), lost 15-20% of potential daylight work hours in the hottest month of 2018.	1
The health effects of wildfires range from direct thermal injuries and death, to the exacerbation of acute and chronic respiratory symptoms due to exposure to wildfire smoke.43 Additionally, the global economic burden per person affected by wildfires is more than twice that of earthquakes and 48 times higher than that of floods, although the global number of events and number of people affected by floods are much higher than for wildfires.44 Furthermore, climatic changes, including increasing temperature and earlier snowmelt, contribute to hotter, drier conditions, which increase the risk of wildfires. Yet, wildfires remain an important component of many ecosystems, although they can be ecologically harmful through human ignition or when forest management practices do not fully account for periodic, natural burning.  	1
This new indicator represents the change in the average annual number of days people were exposed to wildfire in each country. It was developed using the Collection 6 active fire product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard the NASA Terra and Aqua satellites.45 Fire point locations were matched to a political border shapefile from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD), and consequently joined with population count per square kilometre, taken from NASA SEDAC GPWv4.35 The result is an	1
annual sum of people experiencing a fire event per day. The mean number of person-days exposed to wildfire was recorded for years 2001-04 (the earliest years for which data with adequate coverage and resolution is available) and compared with the mean from 2015-18. Overall, this indicator reports a mean increase of 464 032 person-days exposed to wildfire per year over the period studied; however, the increase in persondays recorded in some countries is far greater than	1

the mean global increase (appendix pp 7-8). India, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, and Mexico sustained the largest increase in the number of person-days affected by wildfires, with a maximum increase of nearly 21 807 000 person-days in India followed by 17 003 000 person-days in China (figure 4). Countries including Spain, Russia, and Uzbekistan saw substantial reductions in the number of people affected. Crucially, this indicator will evolve over time to cover the health risks of wildfire smoke,43 which can travel far distances and affect areas that are not directly exposed to fires.46	1
Indicator 1.2.2: flood and drought--headline finding: extremes of precipitation, resulting in flood and drought, have impacted human health and wellbeing, with South American and SouthEast Asian populations experiencing long-term increases in both of these natural disasters This indicator tracks exposure to extremes of precipi tation, using weather and population data presented in previous reports (appendix pp 8-9).20,37 Analysis across time and space reveals regional trends for drought and extreme heavy rain that are more significant than global trends, reflecting the varying nature of climate change depending on the geographical region. Floods are particularly problematic for health, resulting in direct injuries and death, the spread of vector-borne and water-borne diseases, and mental health sequelae.47 The average number of extreme rainfall events in the 2000-18 period reveals that South America and South-East Asia are experiencing the largest increases. Prolonged drought remains one of the most dangerous environmental determinants of premature mortality, affecting hygiene and sanitation, as well as resulting in reduced crop yields, food insecurity, and malnutrition.47 The change in the number of severe droughts in 2018 demonstrates areas of significantly increased exposure 1844	1
Indicator 1.2.3: lethality of weather-related disasters-- headline finding: a statistically significant long-term upward trend has been observed in the number of flood-related and storm-related disasters in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, since 1990. At the same time, Africa has experienced a statistically significant increase in the number of people affected by these types of disasters This indicator tracks the number of occurrences of weather-related disasters, the number of people affected, and the lethality of these events. These are formulated as a function of the hazard (magnitude and frequency) and the vulnerability and exposure of populations at risk, using data from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters.48 For the 2019 report, disasters have been separated into two categories: flood-related and stormrelated disasters; and heatwave, extreme temperature, and drought-related disasters. Details of these methods and data are summarised (appendix pp 10-13). For heatwaves, extreme temperature, and droughtrelated disasters, no statistically significant global trend was identified. One explanation for this could be the geographically local nature of such events. However, in the case of floods and storms, a statistically significant trend in occurrence was identified individually across Africa, Asia, and the Americas. A statistically significant increase in the number of people affected by floods and storms in Africa was also noted, although no statistically significant increase in the lethality of these events was identified. The relative stability of the lethality and number of people affected by these disasters could possibly be linked to improved disaster preparedness (including improved early warning systems) as well as increased investments in health-care services, and is discussed further in section 2.49-51 Importantly, work from the 2015 Lancet Commission shows that a business as usual trajectory is  	1
Figure 5: Global trends in all-cause mortality and mortality from selected causes as estimated by the Global Burden of Disease 2017 study52 for the 1990-2017 period, by WHO region	1
Indicator 1.3: global health trends in climate-sensitive diseases Headline finding: although mortality due to diarrhoeal diseases, malnutrition, and malaria is improving, mortality due to dengue is rising in the regions most affected by these diseases As described in the preceding indicators, climate change affects a wide range of disease processes. Corresponding health outcomes result from a complex interaction between the direct and indirect effects of climate change and social dynamics, such as population demographics, economic development, and access to health services.13 This indicator provides a macro view of these interactions, using GBD data to track mortality from diseases that are sensitive to climate change.52 Mortality due to earthquake and volcano events has been removed from the GBD forces of nature category for estimates of weather-related events. Global trends in climate-sensitive disease mortality from 1990 to 2017 are shown, with all-cause mortality presented as a reference (figure 5). Death from diarrhoeal diseases and protein-energy malnutrition has declined considerably  	1
over this period in regions most affected (Africa, SouthEast Asia, and Eastern Mediterranean). Similarly, a marked decrease in mortality from malaria since 2000 has been observed in Africa. Socioeconomic development, improved access to health care, and major global health initiatives in sanitation and hygiene, and vector control, have all contributed to these improvements in health outcomes.13,53 However, mortality from dengue fever continues to rise, particularly in South-East Asia.	1
Indicator 1.4: climate-sensitive infectious diseases Indicator 1.4.1: climate suitability for infectious disease transmission--headline finding: suitability for disease transmission has increased for dengue, malaria, V cholerae and other pathogenic Vibrio species. The number of suitable days per year in the Baltic for pathogenic Vibrio transmission reached 107 in 2018, the highest since records began, and two times higher than the early 1980s baseline Climate change affects the distribution and risk of many infectious diseases.47 The 2019 Lancet Countdown report provides an updated analysis of the environmental suitability for transmission of dengue virus, malaria, and Vibrio, with the most recently available data, and presents an additional analysis of V cholerae environmental suitability in coastal areas. 1845	1
Malaria and dengue fever are endemic in many parts of the world and, as described in the previous indicator, continue to contribute substantially to burden of disease, with young children particularly vulnerable. Suitability for transmission of mosquito-borne infectious diseases is affected by factors including temperature, humidity and precipitation. For dengue, vectorial capacity, which expresses the average daily rate of subsequent cases in a susceptible population resulting from one infected case, is calculated using a formula including the vector to human transmission probability per bite, the human infectious period, the average vector biting rate, the extrinsic incubation period, and the daily survival period.54 For malaria, the number of months suitable for transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and P vivax malaria parasites is calculated on the basis of tem perature, precipitation, and humidity. Climate suitability for these mosquito-borne diseases is averaged for the most recent five years for which data is available and compared with a 1950s baseline. Vibrio species cause a range of human infections, including gastroenteritis, wound infections, septicaemia, and cholera. These bacteria are found in brackish marine waters and cases of infections are influenced by sea surface salinity, sea surface temperature, and chlorophyll A concentrations.55-57 Climate suitability for Vibrio species was estimated on the basis of sea surface salinity and sea surface temperature globally and focally for two regions (the Baltic and US northeast coastlines) where Vibrio (excluding V cholerae) infections are most frequently observed. For pathogenic Vibrio species (excluding V cholerae), an average of the 5 most recent years for which data is available is compared with a 1980s baseline, whereas the new V cholerae specific analysis compares data from the most recent 3 years with a 2003-05 baseline (based on data availability). Full	1
details on methods used are presented (appendix pp 14-24). Climate suitability for transmission is rising for each of the pathogens studied. The second highest vectorial capacity for both dengue vectors was recorded in 2017, with the 2012-17 average 7*2% and 9*8% above baseline for Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, respectively (figure 6). This change emphasises the continued upward trend of climate suitability for transmission of dengue, with 9 of the 10 most suitable years occurring since the year 2000. Malaria suitability continues to increase in highland areas of Africa, with the 2012-17 average 29*9% above baseline. The percentage of coastal area suitable for Vibrio infections from 2010 has increased at northern latitudes (40-70 N) by 3*8%, compared with the 1980s baseline, with 2018 the second most suitable year on record (5% above the baseline; figure 7). The area of coastline suitable for Vibrio has increased by 31% in the Baltic coastline and 29% in the northeastern coastline of the USA. Additionally, the number of days per year suitable for Vibrio in the Baltic reached 107 in 2018, which is double that of the early 1980s baseline and the highest on record. Globally, environmental suitability for coastal V cholerae sensu lato has increased by 9*9%, driven by regional increases in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and northern and western Africa.	1
Indicator 1.4.2: vulnerability to mosquito-borne diseases-- headline finding: climate change induced risk of mosquito-borne diseases could be offset by improvements in public health systems. Investments in public health have resulted in a 31% fall in global vulnerability observed from 2010-17. However, this success is not spread equally, with vulnerability to recurrent dengue outbreaks increasing in the Western Pacific and South-East Asia over the same period While the previous indicator describes the influence of climate over the transmission of several infectious diseases, this indicator tracks vulnerability to one of these (dengue). Importantly, population vulnerability to dengue is modulated by human, social, financial, and physical factors, as well as the adaptive capacity of a community.53,58 Country-level data relating to surveillance, prepared ness, and response from WHO International Health Regulations' (IHR) core capacities for the years 2010-17,59 are used as a proxy for adaptive capacity. Aedes aegypti vulnerability is defined by abundance and vectorial capacity as described in indicator 1.4.1. This index estimates the population-level risk of exposure to Aedes mosquitoes, accounting for the public health core capacity to cope with the potential effects. A full description of the methods used is provided (appendix pp 24-25). A contraction of the vulnerability to dengue is observed from 2010 to 2017 in tropical and sub-tropical areas of South America, Africa, and Asia. However, this decrease  	1
Indicator 1.5: food security and undernutrition Indicator 1.5.1: terrestrial food security and undernutrition-- headline finding: data from all major crops tracked--maize, wheat, rice, and soybean--showed that increases in temperature have reduced global crop yield potential	1
Currently, improvements in nutrient and water manage ment, as well as expansion of agricultural areas in lower income countries, are resulting in increases in global food production.60,61 However, the number of under nourished people worldwide appears to have been increasing since 2014, driven by challenges to access, availability, and affordability of food.62 Undernutrition overwhelmingly affects children younger than age 5 years, causing intrauterine growth restriction, stunting, severe wasting, micronutrient deficiencies, and poor breast feeding.63 Evidence suggests that crop production is threatened in complex ways by changes in the incidence of pests and pathogens;64 increasing water scarcity;65 and increases in frequency and strength of extreme weather conditions that can damage or even wipe out harvests.66 Change in crop growth duration is used as a proxy for yield potential for maize, wheat, rice and soybean, and is based on the time taken in a year to accumulate a reference period (1981-2010) accumulated thermal time. A reduction in crop growth duration means the crop matures too quickly with lower seed yield.67 This methodology is discussed alongside a full description of the Climatic Research Unit database used (appendix p 26).45 Globally, crop yield potential for maize, winter wheat, and soybean has reduced in concert with increases in temperature (figure 8), challenging efforts to achieve SDG 2 to end hunger by 2030.66 This data resonates with a meta-analysis of the literature by Zhao and colleagues,68 which suggests that global yields of these four key crops are reduced respectively by 6%, 3*2%, 7*4%, and 3*1%, globally for each 1C increase in global mean temperatures.	1
Indicator 1.5.2: marine food security and undernutrition-- headline finding: between 2003 and 2018, sea surface temperature rose in 34 of 64 investigated territorial waters, presenting risk to marine food security Fish provide almost 20% of animal protein intake to 3*2 billion people, with a greater reliance on fish sources of protein in low-income and middle-income countries, particularly small island developing states.69 Climate change threatens fisheries and aquaculture in a number of ways, including through sea surface temperature rise; change in intensity, frequency, and seasonality of extreme events; sea level rise; and ocean acidification.70 Acute dis turbances such as thermal stress lead to impaired recovery of the coral reefs, which threatens marine fish populations and subsequently marine primary productivity--a key source of omega-3 fatty acids for many populations.71 1847	1

this indicator now includes 64 territorial waters (including countries for which data is available) located in 16 FAO fishing areas, and is complemented by monitoring of coral bleaching due to thermal stress (abiotic indicators), and per-capita capture-based fish consumption (biotic indicator; appendix pp 27-47). Between 2003 and 2018, sea surface temperature has risen in 34 of the 64 territorial waters, with a maximum increase of 3*5C observed in Finland.	1
Conclusion The indicators presented in this section provide evidence of the exposures, vulnerabilities, and impacts of climate change on health. They show worsening exposures and vulnerabilities along a range of temperature and precipitation pathways, with reductions in crop yield potentials, and increases in vectorial capacity for a number of climate-sensitive diseases. These effects are felt most acutely by low-income and middle-income countries across the world. Continued work on attribution remains an important consideration with regards to outcome. For example, migration was addressed in earlier reports, in which questions of attribution to climate change remained particularly challenging.20,37 Irrespective of how climate change migrants are counted,75 many factors contribute to health risks faced by migration. Resulting health impacts depend on both pre-existing conditions (eg, mental health and nutritional status, desire to migrate, and existing health systems) along with interventions (eg, health-care access, provision of food and shelter, and changing health-related resources). Similarly, in 2018, the links between climate change and mental health were presented.37 Mental health might be negatively affected in various ways by heat waves, loss of property, and loss of livelihoods due to floods, or climate-induced migration. However, although many varied links have been identified between climate and mental health, they are highly socially and culturally mediated. Attempting to operationalise these linkages as a single-number indicator--linking climate change and mental health outcomes--remains elusive, yet quantifying these effects is of clear importance.76	1
Section 2: adaptation, planning, and resilience for health As knowledge of the health consequences of climate change increases, so too does the urgent need to increase efforts to protect people from adverse effects, particularly given the slow progress of mitigation of these effects. Health systems will be placed under increasing and overwhelming pressure, and adaptation to climate change is essential, even with the most ambitious mitigation efforts.58 An adaptation gap is apparent, emphasised in some of the aforementioned impacts, and the rapid intro duction of adaptation initiatives with better development strategies and funding across all sectors is necessary to  	1
close this divide. The health sector was selected as one of the top three priority areas for adaptation in an analysis of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions prepared for the Paris Agreement.77 By their very nature, adaptation and resilience measures are local and specific to regional hazards and underlying population health needs. Identifying readily available global metrics, with adequate data and proximity to cli mate change and to health adaptation, is particularly challenging.78-80 Additionally, evaluating the success of any intervention is difficult, given that the goals of adaptation are inherently long-term, and no counterfactual is readily available. Rising to this challenge, the work in this section has expanded, from the initial three indicators proposed in 2016,19 to the eight presented here. The structure of these indicators, and this section, builds on the WHO Operational Framework for building climate resilient health systems,81 monitoring progress across the following selected domains: adaptation planning and assessment (indicators 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.1.3), adaptive information systems (indicator 2.2), adaptation delivery and imple mentation (indicators 2.3.1 and 2.3.2), and adaptation financing (indicator 2.4.1). True to an iterative approach, many indicators have been further developed. For the indicators evaluating national health adaptation planning and vulnerability mapping (indicators 2.1.1 and 2.1.2), the number of country respondents has increased from 40 to 101. Additional information on implementation and govern ment funding is included alongside qualitative analysis, which was undertaken as part of the validation of the selfreported data. A new indicator has been added, focusing on air conditioning use as an adaptive measure to heat mortality (indicator 2.3.2). This is the first of a new suite of indicators under development, which monitor adap tation to a specific exposure pathway, complementing existing work on health adaptation efforts. Several indicators in this section rely on self-reported data in surveys of national and subnational governments to track health adaptation, with clear strengths and limitations to this approach. Self-reported survey data is subject to response and non-response error, with local verification difficult;79 however, the datasets here--from the WHO and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)-- provide the best available information on national-level and city-level specific health adaptation measures, globally. Further information on the validation techniques of the national data is summarised (appendix pp 48-49).	1
Indicator 2.1: adaptation planning and assessment Indicator 2.1.1: national adaptation plans for health--headline finding: recognition of the need for health adaptation to climate change is widespread, and development planning is underway. In 2018, almost half of the countries surveyed declared that a national health and climate change plan was in place Over the past decade, a steady increase in countries scaling up health adaptation projects to build climate 1849	1
Indicator 2.1.2: national assessments of climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation for health--headline finding: of 101 countries surveyed in 2018, 48 indicated that a national assessment of health vulnerability to climate change had been done. However, of these 48 countries, just over 40% reported that assessment findings had influenced the allocation of human and financial resources	1

resilience has been observed.82 This indicator, based on data from the 2018 WHO Health and Climate Change Country Survey,83 tracks the number of countries that have a national health and climate change plan or strategy, current levels of their implementation, and the commitment of national health funds for achieving the health adaptation and mitigation priorities outlined by governments in these documents. Importantly, the country response rate has more than doubled, with 101 of the 194 Member States reporting in the 2018 survey compared with 40 reporting in the 2015 survey presented in earlier Lancet Countdown reports.20 Global coverage of national adaptation plans for health is growing, with 51 of 101 countries now having a national health and climate change plan in place. Just over half of these countries report at least a moderate level of implementation of their plans; however, chal lenges to full implementation remain, with less than 20% of countries reporting actions underway or plans in place to address most of their key priorities (figure 9). National funding for implementation of health and climate change plans was identified as a central constraint with fewer than 4 in 10 countries reporting at least partial funding for the implementation of their main health adaptation and mitigation priorities. A further analysis of approximately 40 strategies or plans, collected as part of the survey, emphasises that the comprehensiveness and scope of the national health and climate strategies or plans varied widely, with only a small number of plans directly linked to the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process as part of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). About 30% of the national health and climate change plans were published more than 5 years ago. Opportunities exist in national health and climate planning to update and expand the comprehensiveness of plans and for these to be developed into health components of NAP,81 thereby anchoring health within national climate processes and potentially strength ening access to international climate finance for health adaptation. 1850	1
An adequate health adaptation response requires an assessment of the vulnerability of populations to dif ferent kinds of health effects, an assessment of local geographical and meteorological trends, and assessment of the corresponding capacity of health services. A health vulnerability and adaptation assessment serves as a baseline analysis, against which changes in disease risks and protective measures can be monitored, and strengthens the case for investment in health protection.84 Data for this indicator is sourced from the 2018 WHO Health and Climate Change Country Survey.83 Additional information on the survey methods and data is presented (appendix pp 49). An increasing number of countries are implementing national vulnerability and adaptation assessments, with most countries indicating that these assessments are having at least some influence over policy prioritisation. However, translating evidence into funding decisions remains an issue, with only 40% of countries reporting that resource allocation is guided by evidence generated from vulnerability and adaptation assessments for health.	1
Indicator 2.1.3: city-level climate change risk assessments-- headline finding: in 2018, 54% of global cities surveyed expected climate change to seriously compromise their public health infrastructure, with 69% of cities actively developing or having completed a comprehensive climate change risk or vulnerability assessment The effects of climate change are experienced locally, with cities and local governments forming a crucial component of any health adaptation response. For this indicator, The Lancet Countdown works with the CDP to include data from their annual global survey of cities.85 Two components of this data are analysed: the number of global cities that have undertaken a city-wide climate change risk or vulnerability assessment; and their perceived vulnerability to climate change of critical health infrastructure. In 2018, 489 cities participated in the survey, with 297 (61%) from high-income countries. Just over half (52%) of all responding cities have undertaken an assessment and about a quarter either have an assessment in progress (17%) or intend to undertake an assessment in the future (7%). These values represent a small, but steady increase from 2017.37 The health impacts of climate change are of increasing concern for cities, with 54% of responding cities noting that critical assets or services related to public health would be affected by climate change, compared with 51% in 2017.37  	1
Indicator 2.3: adaptation delivery and implementation Indicator 2.3.1: detection, preparedness, and response to health emergencies--headline finding: 109 countries have medium to high implementation of a national health emergency framework in place, in preparation for all public health events and emergencies The IHR are an international legal instrument aimed at helping the global community prevent and respond to acute public health risks.59 Countries are assessed through a set of core capacities, reported in an annual survey of State Parties. The survey was initially a yes or no questionnaire from 2010, and in 2018 was updated to a more detailed tool that assesses the degree of implementation of each of the core capacities (appendix pp 53-61). Capacity 8 (C8) of the IHR focuses on countries' national health emergency framework, which applies to all public health events and emergencies, covering disease outbreaks, air pollution, extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and storms, as well as societal hazards (such as conflict and financial crisis). The survey encompasses three components: planning for emergency preparedness and response mechanism; management of health emergency response operations; and emergency resource mobilisation.86 In 2018, 182 WHO Member States completed the survey relating to C8. Of these, 109 countries had medium to high implementation of the three  	1
Meteorological and hydrological services should work with health services to monitor and prepare for the climaterelated risks to health tracked in section 1.81 This indicator tracks national climate information services for health, which help monitor and prepare for climate-related health risks, using data reported by national meteorological and hydrological services to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Country Profile Database integrated questionnaire. 70 national meteorological and hydrological services of WMO Member States reported providing climate services to the health sector, 15 more than reported in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report.37 Of these, 18 were from Africa, 5 from the Eastern Mediterranean, 22 from Europe, 13 from the Americas, 4 from South-East Asia, and 8 from the Western Pacific. Additional detail was provided by 47 respondents, with several services working with the health sector and creating products accessible to the health sector. However, although climate services can be used for health in a range of ways, including monitoring, provision of early warning systems, and forecasting of environmental risks, application of these services to policy making remains low, with only 4 of the 47 Member States reporting that climate services are guiding health sector policy decisions and investment plans.	1
Indicator 2.2: climate information services for health Headline finding: progress has been observed in the number of countries providing climate services to the health sector, increasing from 55 in 2018 to 70 in 2019	1
components for this core capacity. However, the degree of implementation varied greatly by region, with Africa reporting having achieved 21*3% and Europe having achieved 75*5% medium to high implementation of the framework, corresponding to an average score of the three C8 components of 50-74% and 75-100%.	1
Indicator 2.3.2: benefits and harms of air conditioning-- headline finding: use of air conditioning as an adaptation measure is a double-edged sword: on the one hand, global air conditioning use in 2016 was estimated to reduce heatwave-related mortality by 23% compared with the complete absence of air conditioning; on the other hand, it also confers harms, by contributing to climate change, worsening air pollution, substantially adding to peak electricity demand on hot days, and enhancing the urban heat island effect Indoor cooling is an important adaptation to extreme heat, with air conditioning emerging as a primary mechanism. Access to household air conditioning is highly protective against heatwave-related mortality;87 however, it is also associated with substantial indirect harms. On hot days in locations with high air con ditioning prevalence, this can account for more than half of peak electricity demand88 which, if sourced from fossil fuels, contributes to both CO2 and particulate matter (PM)2*5 emissions. Additionally, waste heat from air conditioning can paradoxically increase external night temperatures by more than 1C.89 Hydrof luorocarbon refrigerants used for air conditioning can escape into the atmosphere where they act as powerful greenhouse gases. In baseline scenarios, these hydro fluorocarbon emissions will increase to 1-2 gigatons of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) per year by 2050.90,91 Consequently, a nuanced approach to heat adaptation must be deployed, which protects vulnerable populations 1851	1
across the world from heat-related morbidity and mortality, while minimising the health-associated harms of air pollution, the urban heat island effect, and contribution to climate change. This new indicator includes four components: the proportion of households using air conditioning; the prevented fraction of heatwave-related mortality attri butable to air conditioning use; CO2 emissions attributable to air conditioning use; and premature mortality from air conditioning attributable to PM2*5. Unpublished data for household air conditioning use, electricity consumption, and CO2 emissions was provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA).	1
The prevented fraction,92 (the percent reduction in heatwave-related deaths due to a given proportion of ditioning, the population having household air con compared with a complete absence of household air conditioning) was calculated using a relative risk for heatwave-related mortality of 0*23 for having household air conditioning compared with not having household air conditioning,87 and the proportion of populations with household air conditioning. The relative risk estimate used for these calculations is based on studies focused on European and US populations, and further research is required to fully understand the effect modification across different contexts.87 The air pollution source attribution methods discussed in section 3 (indicator 3.3.2) were used to calculate deaths due to PM2*5 emissions from air conditioning. Between 2000 and 2016, the world's air conditioning stock (residential and commercial) more than doubled to 1*62 billion units and the proportion of households with air conditioning increased from 21% to about 30% (figure 10). In 2016, this proportion was 4% in India, 14% in the EU, 58% in China, and more than 90% in the USA and Japan. Correspondingly, the global prevented fraction of heatwave-related mortality increased from 16% in 2000 to 23% in 2016, ranging from less than 10% in India, Indonesia, and South Africa to more than 66% in the USA, Japan, and Korea. These trends have also been associated with increased harms. In 2016, air conditioning accounted for 10% of global electricity consumption and 18*5% of electricity used in buildings.93 Under the IEA's baseline scenario, these figures will increase in 2050 to 16% and 30%, respectively.93 Following the trend in the proportion of households with air conditioning, CO2 emissions from air conditioning use tripled from 0*35 gigatons in 1990 to about 1*1 gigatons in 2016 (figure 10), and are projected to rise to 2 gigatons in 2050 in the IEA's baseline scenario.93 In 2016, the number of premature deaths due to PM2*5 exposure attributable to air conditioning was 2480 in India, 2662 in China, 1088 in the EU, and 749 in the USA. Fortunately, various paths forward provide for adaptation against heat-related mortality for those who need it, without the associated harms of greenhouse gases and PM2*5 emissions, excessive electricity demand, and undue contribution to the urban heat island effect. Air conditioning use could be reduced by promoting energy efficient appliances and energy efficient building design through strong, enforced building codes.93 Traditional building designs in tropical and sub-tropical regions reduce thermal stresses by providing shade, thermal mass, insulation, and ventilation.93 Harms associated with air conditioning can be greatly reduced by increasing its efficiency,93 by generating electricity from non-fossil-fuel sources, and by implementing the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phasedown hydrofluorocarbons.94  	1
Conclusion Although many of the indicators presented in section 2 are moving in a positive direction, the pace of the adaptation response from the health community remains slow. The number of countries with national adaptation plans for health and the number of countries and cities that have assessed health risk and vulnerabilities has increased, along with the spending on health adaptation. Thorough consideration of the best adaptation options is required before imple mentation. For example, the health benefits of adaptation measures such as air conditioning might be counteracted by harms caused through a contribution to heat generation, climate change, and air pollution (indicator 2.3.2).  	1
A higher demand for health adaptation measures requires increased adaptation funding. This indicator tracks adaptation spending, using 2015-16, 2016-17, and 2017-18 data from the Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change dataset produced by kMatrix,95 as described in the 2017 and 2018 reports.20,37 Health adaptation spending is defined as national adaptation spending specifically within the formal health-care sector, whereas health-related adaptation follows adapta tion spending for disaster preparedness and agriculture, in addition to health care. Data in this year's indicator covers 191 countries and territories reported in the Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change dataset. Per-capita values are based on 183 countries with popu lation estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook.96 Spending on adaptation to climate change in health and health care increased by 11*2% in 2017-18, compared with 2016-17 data. This percentage increase is notably larger than the change in total adaptation spending generally (an increase of 6*5% from 2016-2017). At the country level, growth of health adaptation spending ranged from 17*5% (UK) to 10% (Latvia); however, smaller increases and less variation were recorded for health-related values, from 11*1% (UK) to 6*8% (Kazakhstan). Impor tantly, health still represented a small proportion of the total adaptation spend, having grown from 4*6% in 2015-16 to 5*0% in 2017-18. Grouped by WHO Region, the highest per-capita spending for 2017-18 is in the Americas (4*2 for health, 11*2 for health-related spending; figure 11). By contrast, in the African, Eastern Mediterranean, and South-East Asian regions, per-capita health adaptation spending is less than 1.	1
Indicator 2.4: spending on adaptation for health and health-related activities Headline finding: in 2018, global spending on health adaptation to climate change was estimated to be 13 billion (5%) of all adaptation spending, and health-related spending was estimated at 35 billion (13*5%). These estimates represent increases in absolute and relative terms over previous data	1
Figure 11: Spending on adaptation for health and health-related activities in WHO-specified regions. Graphs show Adaptation to Resilience and Climate Change spending (A) and spending per capita (B).	1
These findings and those from the UN Environment Adaptation reports show that further work is required globally, both in terms of the planning and implementation of adaptation measures, to improve health.97,98	1
Section 3: mitigation actions and health co-benefits As emphasised in section 1, climate change has already impacted human health and requires an urgent response, both in terms of health adaptation (section 2) and importantly, in mitigation, to minimise future effects from climate change. 1853	1
In keeping with the Paris Agreement's commitment of limiting temperature increase to "well below 2C", and to pursue the 1*5C target, global emissions must peak as soon as possible (some studies suggest as early as 2020) and then follow a steep decline to 2050.2 However, current mitigation actions and commitments are not consistent with this goal. Total global greenhouse-gas emissions for 2017 were the highest ever recorded, at 53*5 GtCO2e.99 The sum of all nations' current commitments under the Paris Agreement is far from sufficient, with 2030 emissions estimated to be lowered by only 6 GtCO2e-- which is only a half of the reduction required to achieve the 2C scenario, and a fifth of that necessary to achieve the 1*5C goal.97 Discussions of greenhouse-gas emission reductions must be directly interlinked with any associated potential positive economic and health benefits. Mitigation actions not only improve health in the long term, through minimising climate change, but can also have near-term benefits through numerous pathways such as reductions in risk of respiratory and cardiovascular disease attributable to air pollution,8 reductions in the risk of diseases associated with physical inactivity and obesity (because of increased cycling and walking),100 and a variety of improvements that could result from healthier diets.101 This section of the Lancet Countdown 2019 report tracks mitigation and its health consequences in different sectors including: energy (indicators 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.2); air pollution (indicators 3.3.1, 3.3.2); transport (indicator 3.4); agriculture (indicator 3.5); and health care (indicator 3.6). Crucially, two new indicators of great importance to health have been added to the section: emissions attributable to livestock and crops (allowing a more nuanced discussion about the health and climate benefits of reductions in ruminant meat consumption), and emissions from national health-care systems. This section will continue to expand in future years by monitoring mitigation and health co-benefits in other important sectors, including industry, buildings, and land use. Overall, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels have risen by 2*6% from 2016 to 2018 (indicator 3.1.1). Concerningly, the previous downward trend in coal supply has reversed, with a 1*7% increase recorded in total primary energy supply from 2016 to 2018 (indicator 3.1.2). However, more encouragingly, growth in renewables continues apace and comprised 45% of total growth in electricity generation. At present, modern renewables represent 5*5% of global electricity generation (indicator 3.1.3), but are predicted to reach 30% by 2023.102 The implications of maintenance of both of these trends are important for air pollution. A continued demand for fossil fuels and an increase in coal consumption have resulted in the number of deaths attributable to ambient air pollution remaining stagnant (2*9 million deaths in 2016; indicator 3.3.2). 1854	1
The transport sector is an equally entrenched emitter of greenhouse gases, with emissions and fuel use main taining a modest growth trajectory of 0*7% per capita CO2e in 2016. Although use of electric vehicles has increased, they continue to represent a small proportion of the global vehicles worldwide. Yet, countries such as China have positioned electric vehicles as the future of driving with electricity in transport, with 21*4% growth in per capita usage from 2015 to 2016, rising from 1*5% to 1*8% of total fuel use (indicator 3.4). Feeding the global population is a crucially important aspect of health and wellbeing along with ensuring economic stability and security. However, the agriculture and food sector are both energy and carbon intense and an important area for climate change mitigation. Global agricultural greenhouse-gas emissions (indicator 3.5) have increased between 2000 and 2016 by 14% for livestock and 10% for crops. As outlined in sections 1 and 2, the health sector is on the frontline of climate change and plays a vital role in any response. This sector is also a major contributor of greenhouse-gas emissions (indicator 3*6), with global estimates as high as 4*6% of global emissions in 2016.	1
Indicator 3.1: emissions from the energy system Indicator 3*1.1: carbon intensity of the energy system-- headline finding: in 2018, the carbon intensity of the energy system remained unchanged from 1990. However, greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion have returned to a growth trajectory, rising by 2*6% from 2016 to 2018. Limiting warming to 1*5C would require a 7*4% yearon-year reduction from 2019 to 2050 In the 2019 Lancet Countdown report, this indicator includes data up to 2016, supplemented with additional statistics for global CO2 emissions from energy combustion for 2017103 and 2018.104 It tracks the carbon intensity of the energy system, monitoring the CO2 emitted per terajoule of total primary energy supply (TPES). TPES reflects the total amount of primary energy used in a specific country, accounting for the flow of energy imports and exports. Key improvements in this analysis are seen in the disaggregation of fuel type, the extension of data from 1970, and the inclusion of new projections forward to 2050. A full description of data and methods is provided (appendix pp 68-69). Global emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion, having been flat between 2014-16, have increased to a new high of 33*1 GtCO2 in 2018 (figure 12).104 This 2*6% increase over the past two years has resulted from continued growth in energy demand--energy mostly from fossil fuels. The carbon intensity of the energy system will need to reduce to near zero by 2050. Over the past 15 years, carbon intensity has largely plateaued, as the growth of low-carbon energy has been insufficient to displace fossil fuels. However, IEA data suggest that carbon intensity could be starting to reduce, with gas slowly displacing coal (figure 12).104  	1

Indicator 3.1.2: coal phase-out--headline finding: TPES from coal increased by 1*7% from 2016 to 2018, driven by growth in China and other countries in Asia Coal phase-out is essential, not only as a key measure to mitigate climate change, but also to reduce morbidity and mortality from air pollution.8 As of December, 2018, 30 national governments, along with many sub-national governments and businesses, have committed to coal phase-out for power generation through the Powering Past Coal Alliance.105 In this year's Lancet Countdown report, this indicator tracks TPES from coal, plus projections for coal phase-out, using the scenarios that informed the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1*5C.2 Coal has returned to a growth trajectory from 2016 to 2018 (figure 13); however, because of the overall growth in global energy demand, the share of coal in primary energy supply continues to fall (appendix pp 70-73). Coal continues to be the second largest contributor to global primary energy supply (after oil) and the largest source of electricity generation (at 38%, compared with gas, the next highest at 23%). Most of the growth in TPES of coal has been in Asia, notably China, India, and southeast Asia. Rapidly decreasing coal use to zero is crucial to meeting the commitments of the Paris Agreement. For example, no less than an 80% reduction in coal use from 2017 to 2050 (a 5*6% annual reduction rate) is consistent with a 1*5C trajectory (appendix pp 70-73). However,  	1
Indicator 3.1.3: low-carbon emission electricity--headline finding: in 2018, renewable energy continues to account for a large share (45%) of growth in electricity generation, with 27% of growth from wind and solar sources With the power generation sector accounting for 38% of total energy-related CO2 emissions, the displacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy sources is of crucial importance.This indicator tracks total low carbon electricity generation (which includes nuclear sources and all renewables, including hydro) and new renewable electricity generation (excluding hydro), using the World Extended Energy Balances dataset from the IEA.104 Renewable electricity generation was also projected using the scenarios that informed the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1*5C.2 A full description of the datasets, methods, and projections is presented (appendix pp 73-75). In 2016, low-carbon electricity globally accounted for 32% of total global electricity generation (figure 14). Promisingly, renewable energy accounted for 45% of growth in electricity generation in 2018,106 and solar generation continues to grow at an unprecedented rate of around 30% per annum (but still only accounting for 2% of total global generation).107 An assessment of scenarios compliant with the 1*5C goal emphasises that generation from new renewable 1855	1

sources (solar, wind, geothermal, wave and tidal) need to increase by 9*7% per annum, so that generation in 2050 is larger than total global electricity use today. Since 1990, the annual growth rate for these renewable sources was more than 14%, a very promising trend, but one that must be maintained for a further three decades.	1
Indicator 3.2: access and use of clean energy Headline finding: almost 3 billion people live without access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking, and only 7*5% of households in low-income countries report using such fuels Globally, 3*8 million deaths per year are estimated to be attributable to household air pollution,108 largely arising from use of solid fuels, such as coal, wood, charcoal, and biomass, for cooking. Efforts to provide clean cooking and heating technologies could result in substantial health co-benefits in addition to reducing greenhousegas emissions and short-lived climate pollutants.108-111 Additionally, universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all is a key deter minant of economic and social development and is central to health and wellbeing.112,113 This indicator combines both a top-down and bottomup approach from IEA and WHO datasets, capturing total household energy use and household fuel use for cooking, respectively.114,115 The new data on household clean fuel use represents an impressive effort from WHO, combining the results of thousands of national household surveys done across three decades and in more than 140 countries. 1856	1
Details of the methods, definitions, and data for this indicator are presented (appendix pp 75-76). Use of clean fuels and technologies for cooking for 2015-17 remained low, at 7*5% in households in low-income countries, and 40% in households in lower middle-income countries (figure 15). These data reflect a slow improvement in global access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, which has increased by just 1% since 2010, with almost 3 billion people remaining in accessdeficit.116 Concerningly, although access to electricity has risen from 83% in 2010 to 87% in 2016, residential clean energy usage--which, at point of demand, includes electricity of all sources, solar thermal and geothermal--remains low. In 2016, the global proportion of clean energy use in the residential sector was approximately 24%, an increase from 17% recorded in 2010.114 Solid biomass, which contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases attributable to household air pollution,117 is currently estimated to account for 36% of total residential sector energy use. Future forms of this indicator will work to link residential energy and fuel use to household air pollution morbidity and mortality across the world. One possible approach to achieving this linkage is presented, discussing slum housing in Viwandani in Nairobi, Kenya (panel 2).	1

global environmental risk factor for premature mortality, and results in several million premature deaths from cardio vascular and respiratory diseases every year.8,123,124 More than 90% of children are exposed to PM2*5 con centrations that are above the WHO guidelines,125 which can affect their health throughout their life, with an increased risk of lung damage, impaired lung growth and pneumonia, and a subsequent risk of developing asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.126 Most of the exposure to PM2*5 results from anthropogenic activities, and much of this is associated with combustion of coal and other fossil fuels for electricity generation, industrial production, transport, and household heating and cooking; therefore, PM2*5 emissions share many of the same sources as greenhouse-gas emissions.127 Indicators 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 report on source contri butions to ambient air pollution and its health effects, drawing from the GAINS model,128 which calculates emissions of all precursors of PM2*5 by use of a detailed	1
Panel 2: Case study of household air pollution conditions in Nairobi, Kenya This case study focuses on indoor exposure to fine particulate matter (PM)2*5, the mortality attributable to this exposure, and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions in slum housing in Viwandani, Nairobi, Kenya. In this setting, cooking is done with solid fuels (14*6%), kerosene (72*9%), or electricity (12*5%). Most dwellings do not have space heating (84*6%), with the rest using solid fuel heaters from June to August. Houses without electricity use kerosene-burning koroboi lamps for lighting for the whole year, and 8 h average ambient outdoor pollution levels are around 67 g/m.118 Indoor exposure and space heating estimates were estimated on the basis of 2016 levels using EnergyPlus,119 calibrated to monitored indoor levels in dwellings using different fuel types and ventilation behaviours.120 Two scenarios were modelled, involving the following changes in exposure and heating energy consumption. The first scenario modelled electrification of all existing stoves, lamps, and heaters using the standard electrical network, which was assumed to reduce outdoor pollution by 40% on the basis of the estimated contribution of residential combustion to annual mean air pollution in Nairobi from the GAINS model.121 The second scenario modelled electrification as in the first scenario, but with low energy lighting, and heater installation	1
Indicator 3.3.1: exposure to air pollution in cities--headline finding: urban citizens have continued exposure to high levels of air pollution, with 83% of cities exceeding the WHO's recommended safe concentrations. Energy use, particularly residential combustion, is a major contributor to this pollution The world is becoming increasingly urbanised, with almost 70% urbanisation of the global population expected by 2050.130 Because of the increased population and higher concentrations of emissions, many cities have become hot spots of air pollution. Few cities worldwide have achieved PM2*5 concentrations that are below the WHO guideline of an annual mean of 10 g/m, and many cities exceed this guideline amount several- fold.131 The highest measured concentrations currently have been reported in south and east Asia, while data gaps exist in other world regions. The fact that these high PM2*5 concentrations have been further increasing or stagnant in many regions of the developing world is particularly concerning. A positive exception to this trend is China, where many highly polluted cities have improved air quality because of their ambitious emission control efforts. Cities in Europe and the USA have seen slowly decreasing PM2*5 concentrations with effective implementation of air pollution control legislation and regulation. 1858	1
extended to all dwellings. Additionally, upgrades to dwelling energy efficiency and airtightness inline with local sustainable design guidelines were modelled.122 Current mean 24-hour exposures in Viwandani are estimated to average 60 g/m with the fuels producing an estimated 425 kg of CO2e per household year. Electrification was estimated to result in halving of both greenhouse-gas emissions and PM2*5 air pollution (and hence premature deaths associated with PM2*5), with annual greenhouse-gas emissions reduced to 210 kg of CO2e per year and an annual average PM2.5 concentration of 31 g/m3. For upgrades to the building envelope and increased electric heating and lighting coverage, the decrease in CO2e emissions was similar to that for electrification, but with a substantially greater reduction in PM2*5 concentrations down to an annual average of 25 g/m3, and hence a reduction in premature deaths associated with air pollution. However, these changes do not reduce indoor exposures to less than the WHO-recommended limit of 10 g/m. Therefore, reduction of indoor PM2*5 to adequate and safe concentrations would also necessitate further substantial reductions in outdoor ambient levels or the application of additional technologies such as air filtration systems.	1
This analysis estimates source contributions to ambient PM2*5 concentrations in urban areas outside Europe (more than 3500 cities with more than 100 000 inhabi tants), with results aggregated to the WHO world regions--83% of these cities do not meet the WHO guideline regarding ambient PM2*5 concentrations. In most regions, residential combustion of solid fuels for cooking and heating was the dominant source of high PM2*5 concentrations in 2016. Although coal is prominent in some countries, most of the burden arises from the use of biomass in traditional stoves, which is often associated with net greenhouse-gas emissions due to unsustainable harvesting.	1
Indicator 3.3.2: premature mortality from ambient air pollution--headline finding: in 2016 there were 2*9 million premature deaths globally that were associated with ambient PM2*5 pollution, with minimal improvement in global mortality from 2015. On a decadal scale, improvements are seen in some regions because of efficient emission controls, particularly from industrial processes and power generation Knowledge of the sources of ambient air pollution is essential for designing efficient mitigation measures that maximise benefits for human health and climate. This indicator estimates the source contributions to ambient PM2*5 and their global health impacts, quantifying contri butions from individual economic sectors and assessing coal combustion across sectors.  	1

Indicator 3.4: sustainable and healthy transport Headline finding: global road transport fuel use increased by 0*7% from 2015 to 2016 on a per-capita basis. Fossil fuels continue to dominate as the primary transport fuel, but their growth is being tempered somewhat by rapid increases in biofuels and electricity As with electricity generation, the transition to cleaner fuels for transport is important for climate change mitigation and will have the added benefit of reducing mortality from air pollution.100 Fuels used for transport currently produce more than half of the nitrogen oxides emitted globally and a substantial proportion of parti culate matter, posing a large threat to human health, particularly in urban areas (indicator 3.3).132 Additionally, the health benefits of increasing uptake of active forms of travel (walking and cycling) have been shown through a large number of epidemiological and modelling analyses.17,49,100,133,134 Encouraging active travel (particularly cycling) has become increasingly central to transport planning, and growing evidence suggests that bikeway  	1
Results for 2016 are similar to the estimates for 2015, with an overall number of premature deaths attributable to ambient PM2*5 estimated at 2*9 million. The dominant contribution varies between and within world regions: in Africa, household cooking primarily contributes to high PM2*5 concentrations; whereas in other regions, industry, transport, electricity generation, and agriculture are the primary contributors (figure 16). Small decreases in the number of premature deaths have been observed in the European region and the Western Pacific region (mainly from closing of coal power plants). Sustained improvements over the past 10 years have been recorded in these regions, presumably due to implementation of end-of-pipe emission controls on power plants (Western Pacific) and on other emission sectors in Europe. However, worldwide, more than 440 000 premature deaths are still estimated to be associated with coal burning.	1

in use of biofuels and 20*6% growth in use of electricity. In China, electricity now represents 1*8% of total transportation fuel use. This is more than any other country and an 80% higher share than observed in Norway (0*85%), who have committed to 100% of new vehicles sold being zero-emission by 2025.138 A growing number of countries and cities have announced plans to ban vehicles powered by fossil fuels and automaker Volkswagen has announced that they will stop developing engines fuelled by petrol or diesel after 2026.139 A number of cities have made considerable progress towards improving the amount of cycling. Notably, cycling mode share has increased from almost zero to about 15% in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain, in less than a decade.140 The city's transport policy has strongly promoted cycling though the expansion of the cycle lane network, improved cycle parking facilities, and the introduction of safety courses and new cycling regulations, in addition to enhanced communication on the health benefits of cycling.141 The search for a more comprehensive metric of active transport remains elusive, principally limited by scarcity of data access in this field.	1
Indicator 3.5: emissions from livestock and crop production Headline finding: total emissions from livestock have increased by 14% and emissions from crop production have increased by 10%, from 2000 to 2016, with 93% of livestock emissions attributed to ruminants	1
Obesity and undernutrition present two great challenges to global public health, and both these forms of mal nutrition share many common systemic drivers with 0*5 climate change.142 Current dietary trends are contributing to both non-communicable diseases and greenhouse-gas 0 emissions, with further planetary impacts including Year biodiversity loss and changes in water and land use.101 In particular, excess red meat consumption contributes to Figure 18: Gigaton CO e emissions from 2000 to 2016 the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes as (A) CO e emissions from livestock. (B) CO e emissions from crop production. CO e=carbon dioxide equivalent. well as increased greenhouse-gas emissions.143 Although infrastructure, if appropriately designed and imple  total emissions from crops and livestock will need to mented, can increase cycling in various settings.135 A substantially decline in the future, particular attention modal shift in transport could also result in reductions should be given to capitalising on low-carbon production in air pollution from tyre, brake, and road surface processes, and reducing the consumption of ruminant wear, in addition to a reduction in exhaust-related meat and other animal source foods, particularly in high-income settings.20,37 Importantly, the nuance and particulates.136 Global trends in fuel efficiency and the transition away complexity of any such indicator must be emphasised, and from the most polluting and carbon-intensive transport no one-diet-fits-all solution exists.101 fuels are monitored using data from the IEA; specifically, it For the 2019 Lancet Countdown report, this indicator follows the metric of fuel use for road transportation on a focuses on emissions from livestock and crop production. per-capita basis (TJ/person) by type of fuel.37,137 In response The new analysis added here provides a novel method cul to feedback, this year's indicator displays data in three of understanding the emissions profile of agri tural groups--for example, ruminant livestock. A full categories of fuel: fossil fuels, biofuels, and electricity. Globally, per-capita fuel use increased by 0*7% from description of the methods and data is provided (appendix 2015 to 2016 (figure 17). Although fossil fuels continue to pp 81-84). Overall emissions from livestock have increased by 14% contribute 95*8% of total fuel use for road transport, the use of clean fuels is growing at an increasing rate: fossil since 2000 to over 3*2 GtCO2e in 2016 (figure 18). fuel use increased by 0*5%, compared with 3*3% growth Ruminants contribute 93% of total livestock emissions 15	1
Section 2 emphasises the central role of the health-care sector in managing the damages to health resulting from a changing climate; however, this sector is also a large contributor of greenhouse-gas emissions, both directly and indirectly through purchased goods and services. Nationallevel studies for the USA,144 Canada,145 and Australia,146 have used environmentally-extended input-output (EEIO) modelling to show that health-care sector emissions contribute between 4% and 10% of total greenhouse-gas emis sions in these countries. EEIO models have been widely used since the 1970s,147 and underpin consumptionbased accounting of emissions done at national and global scales.148 An important advantage of using EEIO modelling is that health-care sector emissions are estimated on a life cycle basis, meaning that all emissions are accounted for, from the electricity use of health-care facilities, to the energy to produce and transport medical equipment and pharmaceuticals. National-level studies cannot easily be compared because of differences in how emission inventories, monetary input-output tables, and health expenditure data are collected in each country. Additionally, a proportion of health-care sector emissions in each country is imported from other countries as embodied carbon in traded commodities, thus requiring a global scope and the use of multi-region input-output (MRIO) models that cover more than one country. For this edition of The Lancet Countdown, a standardised, international measure of health-care sector greenhouse-gas emissions was created using multiple MRIO models (EXIOBASE, WIOD; figure 19) that cover 40-47 countries and rest-of-world regions, in combination with WHO health expenditure data for 187 countries, assigned to the MRIO model geographic units. Variations in per-capita greenhouse-gas emissions associated with health care as a function of time, affluence, and the proportion of national economic output spent on health care are shown (figure 19). Per capita, US emissions  	1
(3 GtCO2e per year), with 62-65% of this value attributed to non-dairy cattle (used for meat; appendix pp 81-84). However, the largest increase in emissions from 2000 to 2016 has come from poultry, with a recorded increase in emissions of 58% (an increase from 30*6 million tonnes CO2e in 2000 to 48*5 million in 2016), more than double the increase from non-dairy cattle. Total emissions from crop production have increased by 10% since 2000, to around 2 GtCO2e in 2016. Paddy rice cultivation, which releases methane, contributes around half of these emissions (47-50%), with cultivation of organic soils (such as peatlands) contributing 27-29%, and addition of nitrogen fertilisers (synthetic and manure) to soils contributing 21-25%.	1

are substantially higher than those of any other country and have risen steadily over the study period 2007-16, with a 19% increase. However, per-capita health-care emissions of other countries have increased even more substantially, albeit from a lower base, including China (CN, 180% increase), South Korea (KR, 75%) and Japan 1861	1
Panel 3: Response of the health-care sector to climate change Health systems are increasingly faced with the dual challenges of responding to the health impacts of climate change and reducing the contribution of the health-care sector to greenhouse-gas emissions. From 2013 to 2018, participants from health systems, health centres, and hospitals, from 19 different countries, and representing 9199 health centres and 1693 hospitals, have participated in the Health Care Climate Challenge. The Challenge addresses key areas including local climate change risk assessments, health adaptation plans, fossil fuel and renewable energy project investments, and works with government agencies to support greenhouse-gas emission reductions and health-care sector adaptation. A leader in climate action progress is Kaiser Permanente (KP), one of the largest not-forprofit health systems in the USA, serving 12*3 million members. Between 2008 and 2017, KP reduced its operational greenhouse-gas emissions by 29%, and increased its membership by 36%. As of early 2018, 36 KP facilities hosted onsite solar panels. KP is working to increase its purchasing of renewable electricity to 100% of total usage by 2020. Anaesthetic gases account for 3% of KP's greenhouse-gas emissions. Between 2014 and 2018, KP achieved a 24% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions associated with its use of anaesthetic gases through progressive elimination of the drug Desflurane.150 The largest example of a health system taking steps to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and other environmental effects comes in the form of the UK National Health Service (NHS). A national-level detailed analysis of government funded health care shows that the NHS public health and social sector in England reduced its greenhouse-gas emissions (excluding chlorofluorocarbons) by 18*5% from 2007 to 2017, while clinical activity increased by 27*5% over the same time period.151 Efforts are also being made to reduce water use, plastic waste, and air pollution from the NHS.	1
(JP, 37%). By contrast, health-care greenhouse-gas emis sions in Greece showed a marked decrease (GR, -35%), probably reflecting the economic hardships. Results using the WIOD MRIO model show similar trends but slightly lower absolute greenhouse-gas emissions. The lowest per capita emissions modelled were for India (IN) and Indonesia (ID), which were less than 2*5% of values recorded for the USA. Comparison of emissions per capita and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita show a levelling off trend for health-care emissions versus affluence, except for in the USA. Overall, health care was responsible for approximately 2250 metric tonnes of CO2e in 2016, or 4*6% of the global total emissions (excluding land use change). A parallel global analysis using a different MRIO model (EORA) measuring CO2 only (excluding other greenhouse gases) for 36 countries determined a health-care contribution of 4*4% to the global total for the countries considered,149 corroborating the results presented here. Although global health-sector greenhouse-gas emissions are rising, efforts to reduce these have begun (panel 3).	1
Conclusion The indicators of section 3 present a mix of encouraging and concerning trends. Renewable electricity generation continues to grow, as does access to energy, and electric vehicle sales. However, the carbon intensity of the energy system remains unchanged, with coal supply increasing, reversing the 2014-16 downward trend, and a substantial 1862	1
effort is required to decarbonise the agricultural sector and the health-care sector. In summary, greenhouse-gas emissions continue to rise. Notably, the year 2020 is important for two reasons--it is the year that the implementation period of the Paris Agreement begins, and the year during which most studies suggest global emissions must peak to remain on the path to achieving the 1*5C goal. To meet both commitments, a substantially stronger global response is urgently required, to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and minimise the future health risks of climate change. The health sector has an important role to play in achieving these goals, both by reducing its own emissions and working with policy makers to help design and implement measures that reduce greenhousegas emissions and maximise health co-benefits.	1
Section 4: economics and finance Section 4 examines the financial and economic dimen sions of the effects of climate change, and of mitigation efforts required to respond to these changes. Although many indicators in this section could appear to be distant from human health, they are key to tracking the lowcarbon transition that underpins current and future determinants of human health and wellbeing described in sections 1-3. The projected economic cost of inaction to tackle climate change is enormous. For example, compared with maintaining a 2C limit, the costs of 3C of warming are expected to reach US$4 trillion per year by 2100 (around 5% of total global GDP in 2018), and the total economic costs of a 4C rise are estimated at US$17*5 trillion (over 20% of GDP in 2018).152 Investment to mitigate climate change substantially reduces these risks and generates further economic benefits. For example, the UK's independent Committee on Climate Change calculated that achieving net-zero emissions in the UK in 2050, in line with the more ambitious objective of the Paris Agreement, is likely to require investments of 1-2% of the UK's GDP in 2050. However, if the economic value of co-benefits to human health (and savings to the NHS--for example, from reduced air pollution), and the creation of low-carbon industrial opportunities are considered, the economic implications are likely to be positive.153 Global economic benefits are likely to be maximised (and costs minimised) if strong policy action is taken as soon as possible to accelerate the low-carbon transition. The nine indicators in this section fall into four broad themes: economic costs of climate change (indicator 4.1); economic benefits of tackling climate change and air pollution (indicator 4.2); investing in a low- carbon economy (indicators 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, and 4.3.4); and pricing greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels (indicators 4.4.1, 4.4.2, and 4.4.3). The 2019 report adds an additional indicator tracking the economic value of change in mortality associated with air pollution (indicator 4.2).  	1
Indicator 4.1: economic losses associated with climate-related extreme events Headline finding: in 2018, a total of 831 climate-related extreme events resulted in overall global economic losses of US$166 billion. Although most losses were in high-income countries and insured, no measurable losses from events in low-income countries were covered by insurance The indicators in section 1 presented changes in exposures and resulting effects on health of climate-related extreme events (indicators 1.2.1, 1.2.2, and 1.2.3). The economic costs of extreme climate-related events might exacerbate the direct health impacts that these events produce. This indicator tracks the total annual economic losses (insured and uninsured) across country income groups relative to GDP, resulting from climate-related extreme events. The data for this indicator is sourced from Munich Re's NatCatSERVICE,154 with climate-related events categorised as meteorological, climatological, and hydrological events (geophysical events are excluded) as well as data from the World Bank Development Indicator Database.155 The methodology remains the same as was used in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report.37 Full methodology, along with data for 1990-2018 are presented (appendix p 87-90). Insured and uninsured economic losses resulting from extreme climate-related events, relative to GDP, are shown (figure 20). Absolute global economic losses in 2018 were  	1
Indicator 4.2: economic costs of air pollution Headline finding: across Europe, improvements in particulate air pollution from human activity were seen from 2015 to 2016. If the change in pollution over these 2 years remained the same over the course of a person's life, this difference would lead to an annual average reduction in YLL worth 5*2 billion Indicator 4.2 is a new indicator for the 2019 report and is the first indicator tracking the economics of the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation, capturing the economic costs of the effect of air pollution on human health (indicator 3.3.2). It will be developed into a full suite of metrics over the coming years, with 2019 presenting values for the EU alone. This indicator is based on estimates of the total YLL to the 2015 population of EU Member States that results from the change in anthropogenic PM2*5 exposure from 1863	1
2015 to 2016, if such emissions and subsequent popu lation exposure were to remain constant over the course of their remaining lifetimes. Each YLL is assigned a Value of a Life Year of 50 000, which is the lower bound estimate as suggested by the EU Impact Assessment Guidelines.156 Further details regarding this indicator are discussed (appendix pp 90-93). As described under indicator 3.3.2, anthropogenic PM2*5 pollution decreased between 2015 and 2016 in Europe, largely because of a reduction in emissions from the power sector. If the population of the EU in 2015 were exposed to anthropogenic PM2*5 emissions at the con centrations recorded in 2016 (rather than the concentration recorded in 2015) consistently to the year 2115, the total annual average economic value of the reduction in YLLs would be about 5*2 billion. However, even at the concentrations of anthropogenic PM2*5 pollution recorded in 2016, the total annual average cost to the population of 2015 would still be 129 billion, with the greatest costs generally found in countries with the largest populations. The greatest projected average life lost per person due to high ambient PM2*5 concentrations is seen in Hungary, Romania, and Poland (at more than 8 months per person), with an EU average of 5*7 months of life lost per person. For the first iteration of this indicator, calculation of annual YLLs attributable to PM2*5 exposure in a given year was not possible. However, methodological refinements should allow this metric to be reported in the 2020 report.	1
Indicator 4.3: investing in a low-carbon economy Indicator 4.3.1: investment in new coal capacity--headline finding: global investment in new coal-fired electricity capacity declined again in 2018, continuing the downward trend observed since 2011 Indicator 3.1.2 tracks progress on coal phase-out through the total primary energy supply of coal, while this indicator 1864	1
discusses the future of coal-fired power generation through tracking investments in coal-fired capacity. The data source for this indicator (IEA) remains the same as in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report;20 however, the methodology has altered and has been retrospectively applied to reanalyse all data presented. The revised approach considers ongoing capital spending, with investment in a new plant spread evenly from the year new construction begins, to the year it becomes operational. Previously, data was presented as a so-called overnight investment, in which all capital spending on a new plant is assigned to the year in which the plant became operational (appendix p 93). Data for 2006-17 using the overnight method are presented for comparison with the ongoing capital spending method (figure 21). Although TPES for coal increased in 2018 (indicator 3.1.2), investment in new coal-fired electricity generating capacity continued the downward trend observed since 2011. Notably, this decline was mostly due to reduced investment in the same countries that increased their coal TPES in 2018 (China and India), providing hope for coal phase-out. The number of total Final Investment Decisions (ie, the decision to begin construction) declined by 30% in 2018, with costs and construction times for new plants generally increasing because of larger, more efficient, and complex designs, and the use of advanced pollution control systems, in response to concerns regarding air quality.157	1
Indicator 4.3.2: investments in low-carbon energy and energy efficiency--headline finding: trends in energy investments are currently heading in the wrong direction. In 2018, investments in fossil fuels increased, whereas investments in low-carbon energy decreased Indicator 4.3 monitors global investment in low-carbon energy, energy efficiency, fossil fuels, and electricity networks. It complements the tracking of low-carbon electricity generation (indicator 3.1.3) in section 3 and potentially predicts future trends in this indicator. All values reported are based on the value of the US dollar in 2018 with data sourced from the IEA.157 The data sources for this indicator remain the same as described in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report;20 however, the methodology has been updated (appendix pp 94-95). Total investment in the global energy system remained stable at around US$1*85 trillion in 2018, following a steady decline between 2015 and 2017 (figure 22). Investment in fossil fuels increased slightly, driven by an increasing oil price, and investment in low-carbon energy slightly decreased, driven by reduced investment in renewable electricity--partly the result of continually declining costs. Investments in energy efficiency and electricity networks remained stable between 2017 and 2018. In contrast to the growth in low-carbon electricity generation (indicator 3.1.3), these investment trends are not consistent with limiting warming to ``well below 2C''. The IEA estimate that in order to achieve a pathway consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement,  	1
Occupational health consequences of working in certain key fossil fuel industries, such as risk of injury and respiratory disease, and risk of damage to hearing and skin, are well documented.20 However, with appropriate planning and policy, the transition of employment opportunities from high-carbon to low-carbon industries could yield positive consequences for both the economy and human health.159 This indicator tracks global direct employment in fossil fuel extraction industries (coal mining and oil and gas exploration and production) and direct and indirect (supply chain) employment in renewable energy (figure 23). The data for this indicator are sourced from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) (renewables) and IBISWorld (fossil fuel extraction).160-162 The data for fossil fuel extraction employment for 2012-2017 differs substantially from that presented in the 2018 Countdown report, because of improved data collection and estimation methods for global coal mining employment by IBISWorld. Similarly, values for hydro power and other technologies for renewable energy employment have been revised, following methodological changes (appendix pp 95-96). In 2018, around 11 million people were employed either directly or indirectly in the global renewable energy industry. This value represents a 4*2% increase from 2016, with growth in five of the six renewable energy categories. Employment in the solar photovoltaic industry increased by more than 7%, and remains the largest employer, with China responsible for nearly two-thirds of jobs in this industry. Overall, 32% of global renewable energy jobs are held by women.162 Growth in employment in the fossil fuel extractive industries has been driven by both the growth of coal mining in China and other emerging markets (particularly India), despite a decline in many highincome countries, and the upstream oil and gas industries, following rising prices in 2018. However, employment in both industries is expected to decrease in the coming years because of the slowing growth in demand for coal in key markets such as China, and a decline in other (particularly high-income) markets, as the transition to low-carbon electricity continues, along with a potential decline in oil and gas prices--coupled with increasing productivity.160,161  	1
Indicator 4.3.4: funds divested from fossil fuels--headline finding: the global value of new funds committed to fossil fuel divestment in 2018 was US$2*135 trillion, of which health institutions accounted for around US$66*5 million; this represents a cumulative sum of US$7*94 trillion since 2008, with health institutions accounting for US$42 billion Originating in the late 2000s, the divestment movement aims to remove the so-called social licence to operate from the fossil fuel industry and guard against the risk of losses from stranded assets, by encouraging investors to commit to divest themselves of assets related to the industry. The debate on the direct and indirect consequences of these approaches is nuanced and complex, with evidence regarding their effects only beginning to emerge.163 This indicator tracks the total global value of funds divested from fossil fuels and the value of divested funds from health institutions, by use of data provided by 350.org.164	1
From 2008 to the end of 2018, 1026 organisations with cumulative assets worth at least US$7*94 trillion, including 23 health organisations with assets of around US$42 billion, had committed to divestment, including the World Medical Association, the British Medical Association, the Canadian Medical Association, the UK Royal College of General Practitioners, and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. The annual value of new funds committing to divesting increased from US$428 billion in 2017 to $2*135 trillion in 2018. However, health institutions have divested at a reduced rate, with just US$866*5 million divested in 2018, compared with $3*28 billion in 2017.	1
Indicator 4.4: pricing greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels Indicator 4.4.1: fossil fuel subsidies-headline finding: in 2018, fossil fuel consumption subsidies increased to US$427 billion, more than a third higher than 2017 subsidies, and more than 50% higher than 2016 subsidies Negative externalities, including the various direct and indirect consequences for human health and the natural environment, mean that the true cost of fossil fuels is far greater than their market price.165 Fossil fuel subsidies 1866	1
(both for their consumption and their extraction) arti ficially lower prices even further, promoting overcon sumption, further exacerbating both greenhouse-gas emissions and air pollution. This indicator tracks the value of fossil fuel consumption subsidies in 42 countries, most of which are not members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Although these countries account for a large proportion of such subsidies around the world, they are by no means comprehensive, meaning that the values reported are conservative. The methodology and data source (IEA) for this indicator remains unchanged since the 2018 Lancet Countdown report37 Data for 2008 and 2017, which was previously not available, is now included (appendix pp 97-102). Although fossil fuel subsidies declined between 2012 and 2016, this trend was reversed in both 2017 and 2018, reaching US$319 billion and $427 billion, res pectively (figure 24). These values do not include the economic value of the unpriced negative externalities. If these values were to be included, the IMF estimated that in 2017 global subsidies to fossil fuels increased to US$5*2 trillion--equivalent to 6*3% of Gross World Product.	1
Indicator 4.4.2: coverage and strength of carbon pricing-- headline finding: carbon pricing instruments in early 2019 continue to cover 13*1% of global anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions, but average prices were around 13% higher than in 2018 Adequately pricing carbon emissions is an essential component in shifting investment to develop a lowcarbon economy. This indicator tracks the extent to which greenhouse-gas emissions are priced, and the weighted-average price these instruments provide (table 1), using data from the World Bank Carbon Pricing Dashboard.167 The full methodology is presented and remains unchanged from the 2017 Lancet Countdown report (appendix pp 102-104). The coverage of carbon-pricing instruments remained at around 13*1% of global anthropogenic	1
Figure 25: Summary map of regional, national, and subnational carbon pricing initiatives implemented, scheduled for implementation, and under consideration (ETS and carbon tax) Adapted from State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2019,167 by permission of World Bank Group. The large circles represent cooperation initiatives on carbon pricing between subnational jurisdictions. The small circles represent carbon pricing initiatives in cities. Carbon pricing initiatives are considered to be scheduled for implementation when they have been formally adopted through legislation and have an official, planned start date. Carbon pricing initiatives are considered to be under consideration if the government has announced its intention to work towards the implementation of a carbon pricing initiative and this has been formally confirmed by official government sources. The carbon pricing initiatives have been classified in ETSs and carbon taxes according to how they operate technically. ETS not only refers to cap-and-trade systems, but also to baseline-and-credit systems as seen in British Columbia. Australia had a carbon tax implemeneted in 2012, which was then removed in 2014. ETS=Emissions Trading Scheme.	1

in China, to $127/tCO2e in Sweden. Weighted-average prices in early 2019 were 13% higher than 2018 prices, driven in large part by an increasing price under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS; the largest carbon pricing instrument in the world, responsible for nearly half of the economic value of all instruments com bined). However, the weighted average of these carbon pricing instruments remains insufficient to remain "well below 2C", which would require a carbon price of US$40-80/tCO2e by 2020,168 and the revenue generated through carbon pricing (described in indicator 4.4.3) is far less than the potential annual impacts of unmitigated climate change on global GDP.152 Further carbon pricing instruments are under consider ation (figure 25). With the addition of these instruments-- and in particular the Chinese national Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS; replacing the existing subnational so-called pilots), more than 20% of global anthropogenic green house-gas emissions will be covered by carbon price.169	1
Indicator 4.4.3: use of carbon pricing revenues--headline finding: revenues from carbon pricing instruments increased by US$10 billion between 2017 and 2018, reaching $43 billion, with $24*4 billion allocated to further climate change mitigation activities As the previous indicator outlined, adequately pricing carbon is essential for mitigating greenhouse-gas emis sions. How the revenue generated by these pricing instru ments is used will also have important conse quences. Four ways the revenue could be used include: investment in further mitigation; investment in adaptation; recycling for other purposes (such as enabling the reduction of other taxes or levies); and contributing to other general government funds. This indicator tracks the total government revenue from carbon pricing instruments and the area in which it will be allocated. Data on revenue generated is provided on the WBG Carbon Pricing Dashboard,167 with revenue allocation information obtained from various sources. Only instru ments with revenue estimates and with revenue received by the administering authority before redistribution are considered. Further information regarding the metho dology and various sources used to obtain information on revenue allocation are presented (appendix pp 104-106). Government revenue generated from carbon pricing instru ments in 2018 totalled over US$43 billion; 1868	1
a $10 billion increase from the $33 billion generated in 2017. This change was driven by increasing prices of allowances sold at auction in the EU ETS; higher tax rates for instruments in Alberta, British Columbia, and France; and allowance sales in California and Quebec.169 The revenue allocated to mitigation activities increased by about US$10 billion between 2017 and 2018, and revenue allocated to revenue recycling and general funds also increased (table 2). Revenue allocated to adaptation reduced substantially, from more than US$1*5 billion to around $250 million.	1
Conclusion Section 4 has presented indicators on the economic impacts of climate change, the financial and economic under pinnings of climate change mitigation, and the economic value of the associated health benefits. The results of these indicators suggest that the shift to a low carbon global economy is slowing in various sectors, and previously promising trends emphasised in the 2018 report have been reversed. Given the need to transition the global economy to net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 to limit warming to well below 2C, governments at all levels--in collaboration with the private sector and the population must take imme diate steps towards implementing strong, ambitious policies and related actions to steer and rapidly accelerate their economies towards a low-carbon state. The health sector and health professionals can contribute through the removal of institutional investment in fossil fuels, assessments of the health economics of mitigation co-benefits, and by communicating the negative exter nalities associated with the continued use of fossil fuels.	1
Section 5: public and political engagement As the previous sections have emphasised, climate change is human in both origins and effects. Its origins lie in the burning of fossil fuels, particularly during early industrial periods, and its effects include an increasing toll on human health. Reductions in global greenhouse-gas emis sions at the speed required by the Paris Agreement depend on engagement by all sectors of society. In the 2019 Lancet Countdown report, section 5 focuses on engagement in four domains: the media, govern ment, corporate sector and, for the first time, individual engagement. It tracks trends in engagement across the last decade, complementing this evidence with analyses of the content and dynamics of engagement in 2018. The methods for an indicator relating to a fifth domain, scientific engagement, are being refined to ensure the long-term sustainability of this work, and will be reported again in 2020. In every case, indicators in this section build on methods used in earlier Lancet Countdown reports, which continue to be refined and extended. The media is central to public understanding of climate change; it provides a key resource through which people make sense of climate change and assess the actions of  	1
Indicator 5.1: media coverage of health and climate change Headline finding: media coverage of health and climate change continued to increase between 2007 and 2018 with the elite press emphasising the health impacts of climate change and the co-benefits of climate change action This indicator tracks coverage of health and climate change in the global media, including in the Chinese People's Daily. Additionally, it provides insight into which aspects of the health-climate change nexus are receiving attention in the elite media in India and the USA. For the 2019 Lancet Countdown report, methods to track newspaper coverage have been improved and greater attention is also given to the content of coverage. Global media coverage of health and climate change has increased since 2010. Alongside broader coverage of  	1
governments to address it.170-173 The media indicator (5.1) includes an analysis of global coverage of health and climate change in 62 newspapers from 2007 to 2018. For the 2019 Lancet Countdown report, this has expanded to include coverage of health and climate change in China's People's Daily (in its Chinese-language edition, Renmin Ribao). As the official outlet of the Chinese party-state, the People's Daily is China's most influential newspaper.174 The indicator has been further enhanced by a content analysis of the elite press in two contrasting societies, India and the USA. Elite newspapers both reflect and shape engagement in climate change by governments and elite groups.175-179 The internet is an increasingly important medium of civic engagement and has transformed individual access to global knowledge and debates. The second indicator tracks engagement in health and climate change through individuals' information-seeking behaviour on the online encyclopaedia, Wikipedia.180 Because of its accessibility, breadth, and user trust, Wikipedia is one of the most widely used online resources.181-185 Recognising that climate change is harming people, the global public support government action to decrease greenhouse-gas emissions.186-188 The third indicator relates to government engagement in health and climate change and focuses on high-level government engagement in health and climate change at the UN General Assembly. It tracks references at the UN General Debate, the major international forum during which national leaders have the opportunity to address the global community on issues they consider important.189,190 The fourth indicator relates to the corporate sector, recognised to be central to a rapid transition to a carbonfree economy, both through its business practices and wider political and public influence.191-193 Focusing on the health sector, the indicator tracks engagement in health and climate change through analyses of the annual reports submitted by companies signed up to the UN Global Compact--the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative.194	1
climate change, spikes in media engagement with health and climate change coincided with major events in climate governance.195 These include the 2009 and 2015 UNFCCC Conferences of Parties (COPs) in Copenhagen and Paris and, in 2016, the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals coming into force. However, health continued to represent only a small proportion of the wider coverage of climate change. Analysis details, together with data sources and methodological enhance ments are described (appendix pp 107-127). The indicator is based on 62 newspapers (English, German, Portuguese, Spanish) selected to provide a global spread of highercirculation papers. Additionally, coverage of health and climate change in the People's Daily was tracked to extend the analysis (figure 26). Although the Chinese media has changed and diversified in recent decades, the People's Daily retains its dominance.174,196,197 Across the 2008-18 period, an average of 2519 articles per year were published discussing climate change. A small proportion of these related to human health, with a mean of 14 articles per year. Spikes in coverage are less closely tied to important events in global climate change governance (such as the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015) than in the global media. An explanation for this difference in reporting might be the timing of People's Daily coverage of global events, including the COPs, which occurs after their conclusion; coverage of November and December COPs might occur in the following calendar year. This addition to indicator 5.1 was based on the People's Daily online archive,198 and combined electronic searching of the text corpus (keyword searches and algorithm-based natural language processing) with manual screening of the filtered articles (appendix pp 110-117). The analysis of the content of coverage focused on the high-circulation elite press in India and the USA: Times of India, Hindustan Times, New York Times, and 1869	1
Washington Post. Two time-periods were selected to cover months July-September, during which both countries experienced extreme weather events (monsoon flooding and wildfires, respectively) together with months November-December covering the 2018 COP in Katowice. Articles in international news databases Nexis and Factiva were keyword searched and manually screened for inclusion. Template analysis was used to identify themes; a priori coding derived from Lancet Countdown indicators and inductive coding from recurrent topics in the data were employed.199 Additional analyses and full details of methods are provided (appendix pp 117-127). Coverage of health and climate change clustered around three broad connections between the two areas (panel 4). The first theme is associated with the health impacts of climate change. These impacts related to climate change-related stressors (eg, increased Panel 4: Dominant themes in elite newspaper coverage of health and climate change in India and the USA in 2018 Health impacts of climate change ``Climate change [is] making mosquitoes bolder and the germs they transmit stronger, leading to a spurt in mosquito-borne diseases, particularly chikungunya.'' (Times of India, August 9) ``As large wildfires become more common--spurred by dryness linked to climate change--health risks will almost surely rise...a person's short-term exposure to wildfire can spur a lifetime of asthma, allergy and constricted breathing.'' (New York Times, November 17) Benefits of addressing climate change and health together ``To protect our future, new infrastructure must be low-carbon, sustainable and resilient...in 2030, this kind of climate action could also prevent over 700 000 premature deaths from air pollution annually...if cities are built in more compact, connected and coordinated ways, they can improve residents' access to jobs, services and amenities while increasing carbon efficiency.'' (Hindustan Times, December 5) ``For a short time on Thursday night, a small but fiercely determined group of marchers took over a busy DC street to demand better safety for pedestrians and bicyclists...the district has reported 31 traffic deaths so far this year, up from 29 in all 2017...yet lives could be spared...even if it means taking the space from curbside parking. Gove said. "This is a public health crisis. This is a climate change crisis.'''' (Washington Post, November 16) Adaptation ``Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has adopted a heat action plan which necessitates measures such as building heat shelters, ensuring availability of water and removing neonatal ICU from the top floor of hospitals...it has helped bring down the impact of heatwave on vulnerable populations.'' (Times of India, November 29) `'We rarely do much to protect our cities until disaster strikes... (the) effects of climate change, including the ways it boosts droughts, floods and wildfires, would put more pressure on cities to adapt, mitigate the effects of climate change and become resilient... preparing for disasters and recovering from weather challenges require many different strategies, including holding that rainwater, keeping the flow from going into the drains faster, raising your homes above the flood line.'' (New York Times, December 13)	1
temperatures, wildfires, precipitation extremes, food security, population displacement) and health sequelae (eg, vector-borne disease, heat stress, mental health disorders) and were discussed in 62% of the articles. The health effects resulting from heat were the most commonly-mentioned impact. The second theme focused on the common determinants of health and climate change, particularly air pollution, and the cobenefits to be derived from mitigation strategies to address them (eg, investment in clean energy, active travel, and plant-based diets) and was discussed in 44% of articles. The third theme is related to adaptation. Evident in 13% of the articles, it included both emergency response and longer-term planning. The three themes were represented in similar proportions in Hindustan Times, New York Times, and Washington Post, but Times of India gave greater emphasis to common causes and co-benefits than did the other newspapers.	1
Indicator 5.2: individual engagement in health and climate change Headline finding: individuals typically seek information about either health or climate change; when individuals seek information across these areas, it is primarily driven by an initial interest in health-related content The internet is an increasingly important domain of public engagement, particularly for information-seeking on issues that engage people's attention.200 This indicator tracks individual-level engagement in health and climate change in 2018 through an analysis of use of Wikipedia, the world's largest encyclopaedia. With reviews noting its accuracy,181,201 Wikipedia is one of the most-visited websites worldwide,182 with a high correlation between user visits to Wikipedia and search activity on Google.202 The analysis is based on the English Wikipedia, which represents around 50% of global traffic to all Wikipedia language editions. This is a new indicator for the 2019 Lancet Countdown report and its analysis uses the online footprint of Wikipedia users to map the dynamics of public information-seeking in health and climate change.180,203 It analyses clickstream activity, reported on a monthly basis, that captures visits to pairs of articles, for example an individual clicking from a page on human health to one on climate change.204 Articles were identified via keywords and relevant hyperlinks within articles, refined using Wikipedia categories, and then filtered by the initial keywords. Data and methods are described along with further analysis (appendix pp 127-137). Articles on health and on climate change are inter nally networked, with extensive co-visiting within these clusters (figure 27). However, the co-clicks suggest little connectivity between the clusters. Health and climate change are seldom topics that an individual connects when they visit Wikipedia; initial engagement in one topic rarely triggers engagement in the other. The  	1
proportion of co-clicks from a health article to a climate change article represented only 0*18% of total health article co-clicks to articles discussing any topics, and only 1*12% of climate change article co-clicks were to a health article. This data also reflects the greater interest of the individual in health articles compared with climate change articles, with the majority (79%) of co-visits originating from a health-related webpage.	1
Indicator 5.3: government engagement in health and climate change Headline finding: national leaders are increasingly drawing attention to health and climate change at the UN General Debate in a trend led by small island developing states, which make up 10 of 28 countries referencing the climate change-health link at the UN General Debate in 2018	1
Figure 27: Connectivity graph of Wikipedia articles on health (blue) and climate change (red) visited in 2018 Popularity of articles is indicated by node size; lines represent co-visits in clickstream data. 100	1
This indicator tracks high-level political engagement with climate change and health through references to this topic in annual statements made by national leaders in the UN General Debate (UNGD). The UNGD takes place at the start of the annual UN General Assembly and provides a global platform for all UN member states to speak about their priorities and concerns. An updated dataset, the UN General Debate corpus, was used for the analysis, based on 8093 statements made between 1970 and 2018.205,206 Keyword searches used sets of terms associated with health and with climate change, and engagement in the health-climate change nexus was determined by the proximity of relevant keywords within the statement. Methods and data, as well as further analyses are presented (appendix pp 138-151). The proportion of countries that refer to the links between health and climate change in their UNGD state ments, together with the proportion referring separately to climate change or to health, or both, are presented (figure 28). In 2018, 28 countries referenced the climate change and health link at the UNGD. The data points to an upward trend in government engagement in health and climate change since 1970; a trend that is consistent with broader trends for engagement in climate change. This increase is particularly noticeable since 2004, peaking in 2014, when more than 20% of national leaders spoke of the links between climate change and health. This spike coincided with the transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the SDGs and preparations for the COP 21 in Paris. Since 2014, conjoint references to health and climate change have remained broadly stable; in 2018, 13% of countries made such references. However, increased engagement in health and climate change as separate issues has been noted (figure 28). Around 75% of all countries referred to climate change and 50% to health issues in their 2018 UNGD statements. The upward trend in engagement in health and climate change is led by the small island developing states,	1
for example, Fiji, Palau, Samoa, Dominica, and St Kitts and Nevis, with ten of these developing states referring to the climate change-health link in 2018. In these speeches, connections between climate change and health are explicitly made and linked to wider inequalities between and within countries. For example, the 2018 address by St Kitts and Nevis notes that "NCDs [non-communicable diseases] and climate change are two sides of the same coin" and Dominica's statement makes clear that "climate change arises from activities that support and reflect inequalities...it is the poor whose	1
This indicator tracks corporate sector engagement through references to health and climate change in companies that are part of the UN Global Compact (UNGC), a UN-supported platform to encourage com panies to put a set of principles--including environ mental responsibility and human rights--at the heart of their corporate practices.207 Although the UNGC has been the topic of criticism, it remains the world's largest corporate citizenship initiative.208-210 Companies submit annual Communication of Progress reports with respect to their progress in advancing UNGC principles. Over 12 000 companies have signed up to the UN Global Compact from more than 160 countries.194 Analysis was based on keyword searches of sets of health-related and of climate change-related terms in Communication of Progress reports in the UNGC database;194 conjoint engagement in health and climate change was identified by the proximity of relevant key words within the Communication of Progress report. Methods, data, and additional analyses are presented (appendix pp 151-164). The analysis focuses on the period from 2011 to 2018 because very few reports are available with data from before 2011. A small proportion of companies referred to the links between health and climate change before 2017.37 This pattern continues in the 2018 Communication of Progress reports. Although about 45% of the 2018 reports refer to climate change, and 60% refer to health, only 15% refer to a linkage between the two topics (appendix pp 151-164). This pattern was even more pronounced in the corporate health-care sector, which might be expected to be the global leader in addressing links between health and climate change. In 2018, although most companies in the health sector referred to health (72%) and an increasing minority to climate change (47%), only 12% made a conjoint reference to both.	1
including the media, governments, the corporate sector and, in a new indicator, individual-level engagement. Each sector is recognised to be central to moving global emissions onto a pathway that maintains global temperature increases to below 1*5C.211 Two broad conclusions can be drawn from the analyses presented in section 5. First, engagement in health and climate change has increased over the last decade, with a more pronounced upward trend for engagement by the media and government than by the corporate sector. With respect to the elite media, there is evidence of informed and detailed engagement with the health impacts of climate change and with the co-benefits of climate change action. At the global forum of the UN General Assembly, an increasing number of countries are giving attention to the health-climate change nexus. Led by the small island developing states, these countries are underlining the north-south inequalities in respon sibility for, and vulnerability to, climate change and its adverse health impacts. Although media engagement is increasing, it is episodic rather than sustained, with so-called issue attention increasing at key moments in global climate governance, particularly the UNFCCC COPs. The role of the COPs in public and political engagement has been noted in other reports,195,212 with the meetings providing a global stage for both national leaders and non-government organisations (including scientists, religious leaders, and health professionals), to contribute to the public debate. The pattern for the corporate sector, including the healthcare sector, is different; it does not display spikes in engagement linked to the global governance of the planet. Second, although engagement has increased over the past decade, these indicators suggest that climate change is being more broadly represented in the media and by governments in ways that do not connect it to human health. As this suggests, the human face of cli mate change can be easily obscured and the analysis of individual engagement illustrates this pattern. The online footprint of Wikipedia users confirms that although health is a major area of individual interest, it is rarely connected with climate change. In the mind of the public, health and climate change represent different and separate realms of knowledge and concern and, when connections between the two areas are made, this is driven by an interest in health rather than in climate change. Taken together, these two conclusions point to modest progress in making health central to public and political engagement in climate change, but underline the chal lenge of mobilising action at the speed and magnitude required to protect the health of the planet and its populations.	1
lands are impacted by severe droughts and flooding and whose homes are destroyed and whose loved ones perish. It is the poor who have the least capacity to escape the heavy burdens of poverty, disease and death." The social justice theme is echoed in other speeches; for example, the Malawi address notes that "the hostile consequences of climate change, food insecurity and malnutrition are serious threats in a country that still relies on rain-fed subsistence agriculture."	1
Indicator 5.4: corporate sector engagement in health and climate change Headline finding: engagement in health and climate change remains low among companies within the UN Global Compact, including companies in the health-care sector	1
committed to an open and iterative process, always aiming to strengthen its methods, source new and novel forms of data, and partner with global leaders in public health and in climate change. The 41 indicators presented in the 2019 report represent the consensus and work of the past 12 months and are grouped into five categories: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerabilities; adaptation, planning, and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. The data published here elucidate the ongoing trends of a warming world with effects that threaten human wellbeing. As the fourth hottest year on record, 2018 saw a record-breaking 220 million additional exposures to extremes of heat, coupled with corresponding increased vulnerability to heat across every continent. As a result of this and broader climatic changes, vectorial capacity for the transmission of dengue fever was the second highest recorded, with 9 of the past 10 most suitable years occurring since 2000. Progress in mitigation and adaptation remains insufficient, with the carbon intensity of the energy system remaining flat; 2*9 million ambient air pollution deaths; and a reversal of the previous downward trend of coal use. Despite this slow progress, as the material effects of climate change reveal themselves, so too does the world's response. 51 of the 101 countries tracked have developed national health adaptation plans, 70 countries provide climate information services to the health sector, 109 countries have medium to high implementation of a national health emergency framework, and 69% of cities have mapped out risk and vulnerability assessments. Health adaptation funding continues to climb, with healthrelated funding now responsible for 11*8% of the global adaptation spend. Finally, public and political engagement continues to grow, with heightened interest around the school climate strikes, the UNFCCC's annual meetings, and divestment announcements from medical and health associations. The last three decades have witnessed the release of increasingly concerning scientific data showing the importance of a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. Although the report discusses several positive indicators, CO2 emissions continue to rise. The health implications of this are apparent today and will most certainly worsen without immediate intervention. Despite increasing public attention over the past 12 months, the world is yet to see a response from governments which matches the scale of the challenge. The role of the health profession is essential--com municating the health risks of climate change and driving the implementation of a robust response which will improve human health and wellbeing. With the full force of the Paris Agreement to be implemented in 2020, a crucial shift must occur--one which moves from discussion and commitment, to meaningful reductions in emissions.  	1

Appendix 2 - Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability A number of challenges associated with choosing indicators to track the health impacts of climate change are recognised, specifically: dealing with signal-to-noise ratios; attribution to climate change; and the role of institutions and policies in determining the impact of a climate hazard on labour productivity, food security, nutrition, and migration. Signal-to-noise ratios are of particular concern here for two reasons. First, with respect to climate warming and climate hazards, annual natural climate variability introduces noise into the system, whereas an important signal is the long-term climate trend.17 Attribution, "the process of establishing the most likely causes for a detected change with some level of confidence"18, thus becomes important when selecting indicators. Second, with respect to identifying the impact of a climate hazard on human wellbeing and health, as reflected in disease, nutrition, and migration, the ultimate impacts on health are heavily mediated by institutions and policies, such that the signal-to-noise ratio between climate hazard and health impact decreases.	1
1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.1. 1.1 Health effects of temperature change Firstly, temperature change relative to 1986-2008 mean was calculated for 2000-2016. The summer months for each hemisphere were selected (June-July-August for northern hemisphere, December, January, February for southern). Maps of temperature change were plotted and an area-weighted mean was calculated for the temperature change grid. The area weighting was calculated by multiplying the value for each grid location by the cosine of the location latitude, to account for the projection of the rectangular grid onto the spherical globe. Area-weighting is the normal way to define global warming, and is relevant to the 2oC and 1.5oC limits discussed in the Paris Agreement (note however that Figure 1.1 shows changes relative to 1986-2008 rather than relative to pre-industrial). The concept of weighting by exposure was introduced in the 2015 Lancet Commission report, to better represent the exposure of vulnerable parts of the population to changes in mean climate and in climate extremes.4 Exposure-weighting can be seen as a mean of `vulnerable heads', while area-weighting is a mean over areas of the Earth's surface. Secondly, temperature changes were projected onto a world population grid and the population-weighted mean for each year was calculated to produce a time series. Note that since the weighting for each year was performed using the population for that year, this cancels out population growth effects. This is true for indicators 1.1-1.3.	1
The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) provided weather data for this indicator. ERA-Interim climate reanalysis data was used, as well as a 1986-2008 climatology derived from ERA. ( Population gridded data was obtained from the NASA Gridded Population of the World (GPW) v4 using UN-adjusted population grid data ( at 5-year intervals from 2000-2020, with yearly population interpolated from these values. 2005 was used as a mid-point for the time series.	1
1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.2. Health effects of heatwaves A heatwave was defined as a period of 4 or more days at a given location where the minimum daily temperature was greater than the 99th percentile of the distribution of minimum daily temperature at that location over the 1986-2008 reference period, for the summer months. The number and length of heatwaves was calculated for 1986-2016 over the weather grid. The mean number and length was calculated for 1986-2008. The summer months for each hemisphere were selected as in 1.1. The change in number and length of heatwaves was then calculated for each year from 2000 to 2016 for each location and the global area weighted means calculated for each year. Yearly population grids were used as described in 1.1 The population over 65 count was calculated by matching demographic data the fraction of people over 65 for each year from the UN WPP with country area definitions, and projecting this onto the population grid. This effectively assumed that over 65 fraction is constant across a given country's area. The number and length of heatwaves grid was projected onto the population over 65. A population weighted mean length was calculated and a number of exposures (heatwaves x persons) were calculated for each year.	1
function of the dew point temperature (see Dunne et al. 2013). WBGT and labour capacity were calculated for 1986-2016. The difference for each year between labour capacity and the mean labour capacity for 1986-2008 was then calculated. Yearly population grids were used as described in 1.1 Using a method similar to 1.2, the fraction of the population living in rural areas from WPP was associated with each country and projected onto the population grid. This was used to calculate the population weighted change in labour capacity for each year to produce the labour capacity time series.	1
1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.4. Lethality of weather-related disasters This indicator is based on the generic formulation from a climate change perspective of disasters as a function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Year to year variation was measured, showing the number of people killed as a proportion of those affected by different hazard type, normalised by the strength of the individual hazards as a measure of adaptive (or maladaptive) changes in national health care services and the associated disaster preparedness and response. Here, deaths are defined as the number of people who lost their life because the disaster happened, and people affected as those requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency; hence requiring basic survival needs such as food, water, shelter, sanitation and immediate medical assistance. EM-DAT at the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) at the Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium ( One underlying assumption is that the normalised number of people killed by climate related disasters is an accurate proxy for measuring health impacts of the climate. Clearly this measure ignores the longer causal chains involving the interaction of climate and health. Finally, a further limitation is that this measure ignores the longer causal chains involving the interactions of weather, climate, disasters, health and health services. To date, there is no international consensus regarding best practices for collecting disaster impact data. However, EM-DAT represents one of the most 17	1
widely used datasets in this area and is used here for a number of reasons: it is updated on a daily basis; includes information from over 21,000 disasters since 1900; the data entries are reviewed and validated for completeness and consistency; and the data comes from a wide range of sources including UN organisations, local NGOs, insurance companies, research institutes and media/press. The validity of the deaths-to-affected ratio as an indicator rests on the assumption that it reflects disaster management and health system capacity. A key challenge for this indicator is in estimating those affected and those exposed, and distinguishing the two; a difficult task in the context of disasters. An important caveat is that while the number of people affected in a disaster is often reported, the operational definition of who is "affected" varies across countries, as do the methods of estimation. Additionally, some of the most severe droughts are related to water management issues, not to weather, and yet the cause of the drought is not differentiated here. Similarly, the cause of landslides is often difficult to determine, and so these events are not included in the data here. Future Form of Indicator	1
Future efforts will include a comparison of estimates of those exposed with those affected. Additionally, the impact of replacing the number of people killed with the number requiring assistance will also be explored. A subsidiary indicator will come from the online Sendai Framework Monitor. Here countries will start reporting against the Sendai Framework indicators and the DRR related indicators of the SDGs. The first Sendai Framework and SDG progress report will be released in 2019 1. This indicator therefore aims to expand to include country specific progress in vulnerability levels of health service systems to climate risks in relation to this monitoring data.	1

1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.5 Global health trends in climate-sensitive diseases This indicator displays generally unprocessed descriptive trends for selected diseases retrieved from The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project database (1) over the period 1990-2015. The derivation of estimates within the GBD study relies on modelling, rather than analysing direct observations, and the GBD methodology has already been described (1). The trends are aggregated and presented by WHO region as mortality rates per 100,000 individuals per year over the period. We provide also annual estimates by country in the supplement. As far as we can ascertain from the GBD documentation, climate change and weather are not part of the covariates included in the estimates, making it valid to examine GBD outputs in the light of climate and weather data to formulate coherent inter-country comparisons. Trends are described for: all causes of death, malaria, dengue, diarrhoeal diseases, protein-energy malnutrition, heat and cold exposure, malignant melanoma and forces of nature. Deaths directly related to forces of nature have been adjusted for the effects of the most severe seismic events. Of the ten highest countryyear mortality estimates due to forces of nature, seven were directly due to specific seismic activity, and these have been discounted by replacing with the same countries' force of nature mortality for the following year. 1.

Rather, it presents mortality figures for those diseases which are none to be influenced by climate. The trends presented therefore do not show detection and attribution of climate change to death. They do show the impact of climate relevant and climate sensitive diseases on mortality rates globally since 1990. GBD estimates are now revised annually. Future versions of this indicator may include additional health conditions, may include morbidity as well as mortality, and may extend to national and subnational scales. Increased interest in geo-spatial disease analyses is likely to lead to additional information, such as fringe zone trends and outbreaks, and associate patterns of diseases to climate anomalies, such as those driven by the ENSO circulation. Future disease trends in the GBD estimates will be linked to direct measurements in resource poor areas in Africa and Asia, for example using longitudinal mortality registers from the INDEPTH network.	1
1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.6 Climate-sensitive infectious diseases Methods for the analysis on publication on climate-sensitive infectious diseases follow Liang and Gong (2017), updated to the most recent complete year for which data were available (2016). Briefly, we conducted a systematic review of the literature using bibliographic databases including the ISI Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PubMed. We used a multi-step approach, first searching abstract/title/keywords using strings of [(climate change or climate) and infectious disease], followed by retention of articles focussing on disease in humans, then a second round of searching using further keywords describing more specific climate-disease elements, and finally a manual screen according to specific rules (namely, we removed duplicated, non-English, non-peer reviewed, nonhuman related articles and those that did not report a health outcome related to climate change, such as review, editorial, or commentary articles). Essential article information was extracted from each paper for the summary, including: 1) direct information including the title, journal, publishing year, authors; 2) place name and spatial scale of the study area; 3) study period; 4) research methods used; 5) types of infectious disease studied; 6) types of climatic variable studied; and 7) the conclusions made about the impacts of climate change on human infectious disease. The final dataset included 339 papers. Methods for calculating Vectorial Capacity (VC) follow Liu-Helmersson et al. (2016) and Liu-Helmersson et al. (2014). VC refers to a vector's ability to transmit disease to humans. It incorporates interactions between host, virus, and vector, assuming that all three of these elements are present. Specifically, VC represents the average daily number of secondary cases generated by one primary case introduced into a fully susceptible population, and is expressed as:	1
Where a is the average vector biting rate, bh is the probability of vector to human transmission per bite, bm is the probability of human to vector infection per bite, n is the duration of the extrinsic incubation period - EIP, m is the vector mortality rate, and m is the female vector-to-human population ratio. In our application, the time unit is one day and each of the vector parameters depends on temperature, with parameter values derived from the literature, typically from experimental data, as described in Liu-Helmersson et al., (2014). Diurnal temperature range (DTR) was reconstructed using a representative daily temperature through a piecewise sinusoidal function based on the monthly average of daily minimum, maximum, and mean observations. We extracted the annual average VC values per grid cell to Aedes aegypti presence points provided in Kraemer et al., (2015) and averaged these values by country to get country specific trends in VC at a yearly time step from 1950-2015. Climate data were taken from the Climate Research Unit Time Series (CRU-TS 3.22) online database of gridded (0.5 x 0.5 degrees) monthly averages of daily temperature observations (minimums, maximum, and mean) for the period January 1, 1950 to December 31, 2015 (the latest year available). Key caveats and limitations of the model and its parameterisation are described in Liu-Helmersson et al., (2014, 2016). It is difficult to extrapolate the trend in publication effort and trends to 2030 given the very recent near exponential increase in publications meeting the systematic search criteria and the dynamic nature of representativeness of both disease types and geographical spread through time. However, in the near term, we can expect an ongoing increase in the volume of publications exploring climate change - infectious disease associations, covering increasingly more dynamic and complex disease systems with increasing taxonomic and geographic representativeness. We might expect an ongoing decline or flattening off in the proportion of publications reporting positive associations (i.e., increases in risk) as more and increasingly complex systems are addressed more robustly with increasing potential to address confounding and interacting factors. Climate change is not expected to be a universal driver of increasing disease risk and many disease systems may exhibit overall declines in risk as changes in climatic factors could similarly drive components of disease transmission systems beyond environmental optima (Lafferty and Mordecai, 2016). Understanding this broader range of responses is critical to tailor research and management efforts on disease systems and populations. There has been a clear and consistent increase in globally averaged VC since the late 1970s. For Aedes aegypti, VC was an average of 9.4% higher in 2015 relative to a 1950 baseline. Extrapolating the strong linear increase in VC for Aedes aegypti since 1950 (R2 = 0.784) suggests that VC could increase by a further 1.6% by 2030 (i.e., ~11% overall increase relative to the 1950 baseline). This extrapolation is based only on the observed increase in VC to date and does not take into account actual projections of climate change from global circulation models.	1

1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.7. Food security and undernutrition 1.7.1. Vulnerability to undernutrition In an increasingly connected world, food security is equally a globalised concern. The link between agricultural production, health and nutrition, and climate is complex. Thus identifying a single climate and under-nutrition indicator to track, requires compromises and an understanding that only certain aspects of this relationship can be addressed. This methods section explores the logic and rationale behind the specific indicator selected to track climate, food insecurity, and health. In doing so, a number of additional potential indicators are discussed, to contextualise the chosen indicator. First a rapid review of the literature was undertaken to explore indicators of food security, under-nutrition, and climate, and the pathways under which climate change affects under-nutrition. This creates the narrative behind the chosen indicator and its evolution, and is used to identify the critical parameters that need to be taken account of when choosing how to construct the indicator. Second, informed by this review, relevant country-level data were collected that address food production-related vulnerability and exposure to global warming. Third, an indicator was constructed. Fourth, looking forward, a more nuanced indicator is considered that will build on real time data that incorporates temperature in addition to vulnerability and exposure. Whilst the indicator explored here focuses on climate and under-nutrition, it is recognised that food insecurity has long been closely linked to poverty (for example, Reutlinger, 1985; Maxwell, 1996), whether low yields for farmers, low purchasing power for consumers, or a high proportion of income spent on food. 23	1
Thus, irrespective of climate, there are many approaches to enhancing food security and nutrition. Literature and narrative Food security has been defined by the FAO as "a situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life" (FAO. 2002. The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2001. Rome). Thus food security requires there to be enough food, in the right place, and for people to be able afford to purchase it. If an individual is not food secure, implicitly they are at risk of under-nourishment and ill-health. Most of the world's food insecure are located in African countries by proportion (27% undernourished) and South Asian countries by absolute numbers (300m undernourished) ( At a global level, total food availability in any one year depends on stocks and current year harvest. Governments and individuals hold grain reserves. Whereas public storage has stabilising impact on food price volatility and therefore a positive impact on food security, grain held by private sector corporations tends to be for speculation (d'Amour, 2016) and thus plays a much smaller role with respect to food security. Carry-over stocks of grain have been described by Lester Brown, president of the Earth Policy Institute, as the most basic indicator of food security. Thus the number of days' worth of grain held in storage can be considered to provide one real time indicator of global food security. Globally, over the past three decades, stocks have been falling, due variously to liberalization of grain markets, the high costs of storage, and governments being increasingly willing to rely on markets rather than storage in times of localized shortages (Figure 1). Whilst this could suggest a reduction in global food security, the accompanying increased trade in grains can substitute for storage, mitigating the impacts of idiosyncratic food production stocks across space, whereas storage mitigates across time.	1
Grain in storage, expressed as the length of time in days that time the world's food reserves would feed the global population (source: Compiled by Earth Policy Institute from United States Department of Agriculture, Production, Supply & Distribution) Lower-income countries are vulnerable to climate change, whether they highly dependent on grain imports, or on domestic production, but in different ways. The food system is increasingly globalised, and countries that are highly dependent on food imports are particularly vulnerable to non-localised agricultural productivity shocks that originate in other countries and are propagated through international food markets (Ahmed et al., 2009; d'Amour et al., 2016), suggesting that increased trade may not be able to fully substitute for reduced food stocks. This was clearly demonstrated in the 2008 food crisis. Droughts in Australia affecting the wheat harvest triggered speculation, hording, and several countries introducing export restrictions, which all combined to drive up the price of staples and increase food insecurity (Headey and Fan, 2008), resulting in an extreme spike in the price of rice, and even triggering food riots in Haiti. Indeed, "cereals imports dependency ratio" is a key FAO food security indicator, reflecting the importance of the global food system to individual country food security. Such systemic crises, in which shocks that originate in one country affecting one specific crop trigger instability and crisis in other countries, crops, or sectors, occur with low probability but have a high impact on food security and under-nutrition. They are not the focus here, in part because the pathway from initial climate hazard in one location to undernutrition in another is complex, tricky to predict, and highly mediated by human systems, thus diluting the climate signal considerably. In part in reaction to the 2008 food crisis, countries may increase their efforts to be food self-sufficient. Yet perhaps paradoxically, some countries that increase their dependence on domestic production rather than imports (i.e. an emphasis on food security through self-sufficiency rather than increased ability to purchase 25	1
imported foods) will remain vulnerable to climate change, though under different conditions. This is particularly so for countries located in latitudes where greater temperature increases are predicted, and where yields of key staples have been found to be particularly sensitive to temperature increases. Greater variability in climate in regions where there are already high levels of under-nourishment has been recognized as a consequence of global warming and a key issue for undernourishment (Schmidhuber and Tubiello, 2007) due to instability in food production (Bruinsma, 2003). Disentangling the impact of climate can be tricky as farming practices and technologies are also changing over time. Candidates for indicator selection Given the complex links between climate, food production, food security and under-nutrition, several options for a suitable indicator were considered. For each of these potential options commonalities exist. The first is a focus on countries and regions where there are already high levels of under-nutrition, thus their populations are particularly vulnerable to negative food shocks. The second is a focus on those countries that are most reliant on domestic production, and thus most likely to be directly harmed by location-specific climate hazards. Though yields will be affected differentially depending on the particular crop and location, there is clear evidence from global studies covering over 20 years of research, that crop yields are more negatively affected across most tropical areas than at higher latitudes, and typically countries with a current high hunger levels will experience the highest yield declines due to climate change (Wheeler and von Braun, 2013). The third focus is on locations where climate change is predicted to have a particularly negative impact on yields. The IPCC reports with medium to high confidence that increasing global temperatures will have an overall negative impact on key staple yields, particularly for wheat and maize, whilst the impacts on rice and soybean are smaller. The impacts are not evenly spread across the globe. Higher latitude countries typically are currently benefiting from increasing temperatures, with yields in some more temperate countries predicted to increase in response to climate change. At lower temperature increases, positive feedbacks have been identified for spring wheat and soybean, which have been predicted to improve globally due to CO2 fertilisation effects. Increasing CO2 concentrations enhance water use efficiency and yields but can be accompanied by elevated levels of O3 that can harm yields. Overall, increases in temperature up to 3 degrees Celsius may enhance average global crop yields (Deryng et al., 2014). Thus globally, shifts north and CO2 fertilisation may increase food security in higher latitudes, and mitigate against loss of yield elsewhere at the level of the global food system. Given the decision to focus on countries that are currently experiencing high levels of under-nutrition, that are particularly dependent on domestic production of staple foods, and that are in locations where global warming will have a negative impact on yields, several potential indicators were considered that link to temperature, drought, and vulnerability. Temperature, climate, and under-nutrition 26	1
Overall crop yields for staples (excluding rice for which no overall change is predicted) are predicted to decline on average by 8% by the 2050s in South Asia (16% maize, -11% sorghum) and Africa (-17% wheat, -5% maize, -15% sorghum, 10% millet), currently the most food insecure regions (Wheeler and von Braun, 2013), as a result of increasing temperatures. Recognising the well documented linkages between temperature and yield loss, one option considered was to monitor temperature. Such a temperature-oriented indicator would provide a strong climate signal, but weaker food availability and nutrition signal; is highly data intensive, with the required data being time, location, and crop and variety specific; and with important interactions between temperature and precipitation (Jones and Thornton, 2003). For example, the effects of extreme temperature or precipitation events within any particular growing season can have disproportionately large impacts on final yields. Daytime warming has been found particularly harmful to maize in African countries whereas night time warming is particularly harmful for rice (Lobell et al., 2011). Drought, climate, and under-nutrition The second option considered was to monitor the number of households affected by droughts, particularly those in countries already experiencing under-nutrition. Climatic hazards, in the form of droughts, and to a lesser extent floods, have been identified as causing localised and relatively sudden onset of extreme food insecurity (Devereux, 2007) and accompanying health problems in vulnerable communities that are highly dependent on agriculture. Such climate hazards are predicted to increase as a consequence of global warming (Easterling et al., 2000), and are particularly tricky to adapt to in the shorter and longer term. One of the most comprehensive databases of negative harvest shocks caused by drought can be found on reliefweb.org. Reliefweb tracks "disasters" that can be categorized using various search terms. Searching for "drought" within the database allows one to count the number of "drought" events that have resulted in a sufficiently severe localised weather-induced harvest failure to cause significant increases in hunger in the country where the drought occurred. For example, in 2016, Sri Lanka drought led to the loss of two consecutive harvest losses that resulted in 900,000 people being severely food insecure and requiring immediate support to mitigate the impact (Reliefweb.org). However, isolating the climate warming signal from cyclical processes such as El Nino events, given the relatively short time series for which data are available, is not possible and so this option is not pursued. Yield, climate, and under-nutrition There is considerable evidence that climate change will have a negative impact on yields in lower latitudes, suggesting the possibility of an indicator that links to realised yields in countries already experiencing high levels of under-nutrition. Average yield data can be obtained from FAOSTAT for the key staple grains for each country, and divergences from regional and global trends calculated. However, even measuring yield differentials rather than absolute yields, given the myriad of adaptation opportunities in the short to medium term that can be adopted to prevent yields from falling, the climate-yield reduction signal is 27	1
weakened and thus too the climate health signal. Thus this option is therefore not pursued. Vulnerability, climate, and under-nutrition The fourth option is to focus on vulnerability and exposure of populations in locations where the literature is confident that temperature increases will affect yields negatively. Two key dimensions are considered: reliance on domestic production in lower-latitude countries most likely to be affected negatively by climate change; and existing prevalence of under-nourishment. Countries with low cereal import dependence ratios (high domestic production dependence) are countries most vulnerable to localised weather shocks. This is the option that is followed, and detailed in the section below, though it is recognized that as presented, the climate-health signal remains weak. The indicator currently combines data on vulnerability, as proxied by current levels of under-nutrition, with exposure, as proxied by dependence of the population on locally produced climate-sensitive crops. Data The FAO dataset reveals 5 countries with "very high" (>35%) levels of undernourishment; 15 countries with "high" (>25%) levels; and 18 countries with "moderately high" (>15%) levels ( Details are provided in Table 1 for current under-nourishment prevalence. These countries were then categorised according to the extent to which they are dependent on domestic production, the key cause of their levels of under-nourishment, and their vulnerability to climate-related falls in yield, based on location. At a more aggregated level, five regions with under-nourishment prevalence rates of over 15% stand out. These are Southern Africa (excluding South Africa), Middle Africa, Eastern Africa, Southern Asia, and Western Africa. Regional details Countries in southern Africa are highly dependent on food production in the region. Therefore, though individually some countries have a low "domestic production" indicator (for example, Swaziland, 26.8%), the regional "domestic production" indictor is 91%, implying that the region only imports 9% of its food requirements. Thus any localised drought or general fall in production affects the region broadly, though these countries are less vulnerable to the low-probability high-impact systemic crises precipitated by harvest shocks in different parts of the globe. Reflecting the risk of high dependence on local food production, in 2003, 14.5 million people were reported to be at risk of starving in Malawi, Mozambique, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe, precipitated by a twoyear drought in the region. Compounding this high dependence on domestic production is a high dependence on individual crops. For example, Zambia has an 88% maize dependency, and Mozambique 64%. Crop simulations moreover suggest maize yields in this region are highly sensitive to climate change. South African maize yields are predicted to fall between -8%, -25%, and -42% for high, medium, and low-productivity outcomes; with equivalent numbers for Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia of 2%, -10%, and -22% (Hertel et al., 2010; Schlenker 28	1
and Lovell, 2010). Given these data, southern Africa is a key region to monitor exposure and vulnerability as reflected in current undernutrition and reliance on domestic production. Figure 1 demonstrates clearly that countries in southern Africa remain persistently food insecure, and vulnerable to localised climate hazards.	1
Under-nutrition in key southern African countries, and % regional production (source: FAOSTAT) In the following figure, which provides additional detail for the indicator presented in the main text, the first panel in Figure 1.11 shows where countries with the highest prevalence of under-nourishment are located. The following five panels present average prevalence of under-nutrition for the thirty countries, which has been falling in each region; the total number under-nourished (TUN), which is stable or increasing in each region; and the TUN weighted by dependence on regional production of grains, which gives a measure of how exposed already under-nourished populations are to localized climate hazards. Southern Africa (7 countries) 30.0	1
Figure: (a) Food under-nourishment prevalence by country (red>30%, orange >15%); and (b-f) vulnerability-exposure indicator for five regions Source: FAOSTAT Caveats The chosen indicator focuses on the extent to which populations already experiencing moderate to high levels of under-nutrition are vulnerable to localized climate shocks that will compromise their health further. At present, the climate hazard itself has not been incorporated directly, though it is indirectly acknowledged through the choice of locations where climate change is predicted, with confidence, to have a large and negative impact on yields, and where populations are highly dependent on local production. Ultimately this indicator will aim to combine critical temperatures that are known to reduce maize yields in lower latitudes, with vulnerability as measured by existing levels of under-nutrition, and local exposure as manifested in regional dependence on maize. The data will be initially collected for the particular case of southern Africa. This exercise will be repeated for the other key regions, and the total population-vulnerability-exposure-weighted indicator presented. The next iteration aims to produce the full suite of indicators addressed above. Our selection of indicator is designed to address food insecurity in the context of the direct impact of climate change on crop production. We do however recognise that this is one element of food security and under-nutrition, and that poverty and 30	1
Given the importance of temperature, the aim is to incorporate temperature into the indicator from next year, with the focus on lower-latitude areas which are highly dependent on maize. This approach will be piloted using data for southern Africa, for which maize is the dominant staple, the region is highly dependent on local production, and climate change is predicted to result in high crop losses. Key climate-oriented parameters for yield include heat stress at anthesis, and accumulated thermal time over the growing season. For example, in African countries, each degree day spent above 30 C during the growing season has been shown to reduce final yield by 1% under optimal rain-fed conditions, and by 1.7% under drought conditions (Lobell et al., 2011). These findings emphasise the importance also of precipitation. For example, water deficits during the two critical days of tasselling or pollination have been found to result in yield losses of up to 22% (Hall et al., 1971). Exactly which temperatures should be tracked, and where, will be addressed in detail during the following year.	1
1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.7. Vulnerability of food systems and under-nutrition 1.7.2. Marine primary productivity Eleven marine fishery locations which are important in terms of projected impacts and vulnerabilities associated with climate change were selected as determined by FAO (10) (Fig. S1). Moreover, since a mini case study on the impact of changing marine primary productivity on commercial fish catch and human health in the Persian Gulf is presented herein, therefore, Persian Gulf (i.e., location 12) was also included among the locations under investigation. February and August, representing cold and warm periods, were considered for data acquisition. The databanks used for extracting the data related to the A-biotic and Biotic indexes are tabulated in Table S1.	1
As presented in Table S1, there exist some spatial and temporal limitations. More specifically, some of the databases do not present a clear data trend while some other databases only include recently-collected data and there is a lack of log-term data required to interpret the variations in some index groups. Future It would be ideal to observe and monitor the A-biotic index group defined under the Form of Marine Primary Productivity for a period of 3-5 years at the locations of important Indicator fishing sites and sensitive marine costal ecosystems especially coral reefs (Fig. S1). These could be found in the databases introduced herein (Table S1). Simultaneously, Biotic index group parameters including density and abundance of important commercial fish stocks (i.e., biomass of commercial fish stocks) and their respective ichthyoplankton community shall also be assessed during the same time period and at the same locations. It is also suggested to investigate the diversity and density of phytoplankton community at the same locations and over similar time frame too. Such findings could assist in assessing the human health-related unfavourable consequences of climate change through jeopardizing marine primary production or in another word, marine-based food security and nutrition. Moreover, the resultant implications could serve as guidelines for the policy makers and the authorities of the marine environment departments to strive to engage NGOs and local communities to contribute to conservation, management, and sustainable utilization of the marine resources and ecosystems. Finally, in locations where commercial fish catch has been negatively affected leading to decreased fish consumption, necessary measures should be taken in order to induce public awareness regarding the associated negative health impacts while trying to change the pattern of consumption in favour of other available marine products. Additional Analysing the sea surface temperature (SST) data for twelve marine fishery locations Informati revealed approximately 1oC increase from 1985 (22.74oC) to 2016 (22.73oC) (11). on Analysing sea surface salinity (SSS) data for the twelve marine fishery locations obtained from the NASA Earth Observatory databank (Table above) revealed 0.43 PSU increase from 1985 (34.98 PSU) to 2014 (35.41 PSU). Coral reed ecosystems are seen to have deteriorated between 2009 and 2016 (12), and the occurrence of Alert 2 has significantly increased. For instance, in February 2016, the incidence of Alert 1 in the Great Barrier Reef compared with February 2009 confirms the severity of its bleaching status (Figure S3).	1

Note: As quoted from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch Operational Near-real-time Twiceweekly Global 50 km Satellite Coral Bleaching Thermal Stress Monitoring Product Suite, "Bleaching Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) is the 12-week accumulation of HotSpot values that are at least 1oC. A DHW value of one is equivalent to one week of HotSpot at 1oC and a DHW of two is equivalent to two weeks of HotSpot at 1oC or one week of HotSpot at 2oC. The Bleaching HotSpot is a special type of SST anomaly showing the difference between the nighttime SST and the maximum monthly mean (MMM) SST climatology. The HotSpot data contain only the positive values for identifying potential thermal stress conducive to coral bleaching."	1
Fig. S5. Annual fish consumption per capita in Bushehr Province (main Iranian fishing site) from 2009-2016 (Source: Iranian Fisheries Organization (IFO), 2014. IFO 1994-2014 Statistical Report) Food Security and Fish Stocks in the Persian Gulf One basin in which fish stocks are an important source of food is the Persian Gulf. Fish stocks have been declining in the Persian Gulf since the 1970s, with food security concerns arising for the populations here dependent on fish for food.86 Human activities, including industrial activity (including petroleum production that exacerbates climate change when later burned), dredging and land reclamation are influencing fish stocks here.87 Furthermore, recent studies of fishing show that actual fish catch quantities in this region are up to six times higher than the reported quantities given to the UN, and therefore likely to be at unsustainable levels.88 These factors are compounding to increase the pressure on fish stocks and reduce marine populations, which many people in the area are dependent on as a primary source of food. For fish populations already under pressure from human activities, climate change 36	1
presents a further challenge to fish stocks in this region by altering the ecosystems in which they live. Thus, the ability of fish populations to withstand and recover from direct human impacts is compromised and threatens the future maintenance and even survival of fish populations in the Persian Gulf. This in turn has implications for human health. Food security in the southern Persian Gulf is already a concern and fish consumption is an important source of protein, accounting for up to 10% of the population's protein consumption. Although innovations in aquaculture have helped address some food security concerns inland, marine fish populations are still declining and so food insecurity is still problematic for coastal communities in the Persian Gulf.89 Considering existing declines in marine fish populations and food security concerns in the Persian Gulf, it is important to understand the implications of climate change in this region, for these current risks could be further exacerbated by ecosystem changes associated with a changing climate. Changes to SST and SSS, key proxies for measuring the influence of climate change on fish stocks, have been found to have been negatively impacting the coral reefs in the Persian Gulf, which fish populations are dependent upon for their survival; for example, there were mass coral bleaching events in the Persian Gulf in 1996 and 1998, which caused a decline in fish.87 SST has risen since 2013, but also exceeded the coral bleaching threshold of 33C in the summer months across both regions throughout the period 2013 to 2017 (see Appendix 2 Figure S4).90 Rising SST and associated coral stress is likely to have contributed to lower fish populations and associated decreases in the total catch of major commercial fish species in the Iranian waters in the Persian Gulf, including tiger tooth croaker (Otolithes ruber), threadfin (Polynemus spp.), and silver pomfret (Pampus argenteus). Bushehr Province, the main Iranian fish catching site, has experienced a decrease in the total catch of the major commercial fish species, leading to a sharp decline in annual fish consumption per capita, from 46.8 kg in 2009 to 24.7 kg in 2016 (see Appendix 2 Figure S5).91 This decline is most likely a combination of human stressores, including climate change and overfishing, but nonetheless the consequences for human health are clear - reduced fish stocks increases food insecurity and risks undernutrition in the region, as protein from fish becomes increasingly unavailable.	1
1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.8. Migration and population displacement The presumed link between climate change and migration is now firmly embedded in academic and public consciences. Yet critical voices continue to highlight both the lack of evidence linking climate change directly to migration through linear causality and the multitude of factors which influence any connections between the two. These criticisms do not deny interactions between climate change and migration, nor the possibility of future occurrences of large-scale migration linked to climate change. They simply point out the truisms from migration research which are often bypassed that: 1. Migration is and always has been part of humanity. 2. Many factors, including climate-related, influence and have always influenced human migration and non-migration decisions. 3. Where people are forced to migrate or not to migrate when they would prefer otherwise, in many circumstances, it is lack of support mechanisms to deal with environmental changes, rather than the environmental changes themselves, which are the root cause of the migration.	1
Point 3 is not about removing environmental influences. When houses fall off eroding cliffs in California or lava starts flowing through settlements, little option exists but to migrate, since few support mechanisms exist which would prevent the environmental changes. The key for this indicator is determining when climate change is the only environmental change for which support mechanisms might be needed. For instance, the Californian cliffs have always been prone to erosion, even if climate change influences the rates. Similarly, any influences which climate change is having or might have on volcanic activity (McGuire, 2010) do not change the fact that the settlements were vulnerable to lava flows anyway. Nonetheless, Table 1 provides key ways which are not covered in this indicator in which climate change might be a factor in people being forced to migrate. Each factor in Table 1 has listed a root cause and a possible intervention mechanism which has the potential for precluding the forced migration or making the migration somewhat forced and somewhat not forced. As such, being a factor does not mean being the cause (and an intervention might also cause further problems). Consequently, this indicator highlights the phrasing `due to climate change only' to understand where forced migration is truly occurring due to climate change with no other possibilities-- and to avoid climate change being used as a scapegoat because it is easier to blame climate change than to tackle the real causes of the migration.	1
Table 1: How climate change might be a factor in forced migration. Factor Extreme weather including floods, droughts, and storms. Increased air temperatures (averages and peaks, especially over extended periods of time) making it dangerous to work outdoors. Limited food or freshwater.	1
1. Sea-level rise, with three sources (Table 2): (i) slow melting of ice (glaciers, ice sheets, and permafrost) leading to centimetres of sea-level rise over years and undermining of traditional ice-based livelihoods; (ii) thermal expansion of water bodies leading to metres of sea-level rise over decades, and (iii) ice sheet collapse (Greenland and Antarctica) possibly leading to tens of metres of sea-level rise but likely over centuries. 2. Changing Arctic ice conditions which cause coastal erosion--sometimes metres per year--because lack of sea ice leads to wave, storm, and current action on coastlines. 3. Ocean acidification which could lead to shingle beach erosion or, coupled with elevated sea-surface temperatures, could lead to major coral mortality through bleaching which would expose coastlines to the full oceanic power of waves, storms, and currents without a protective reef. It is important to be cautious regarding attribution of witnessed changes and attribution of migration to climate change. Yet what is observed now does not necessarily indicate the only future possibilities. People might later need to migrate due to climate change only, such as if accelerated sea-level rise occurs or if places around the Arctic Ocean become ice free. Therefore, a hierarchy evolves: 1. People in locations migrating now due to climate change only. 2. People in locations which might possibly need to migrate due to climate change only, most likely due to thermal expansion, lack of sea ice, or ocean acidification (possibly coupled with other climate change impacts), because these factors tend to be localised (thermal expansion is global, but as noted in the caveats, displays regional and local variations). Melting land ice might contribute to this category through additions to sea-level rise and destabilisation of land and infrastructure as permafrost melts. 3. People in locations which might possibly to need to migrate due to climate change only, if ice sheet collapse occurs, because this factor would be a major step change in global conditions, with regional and local variations, but with a global baseline. The people in these three sets of locations can be quantified by the population in them, leading to the indicator being the number of migrants and the number of communities (as distinct values) migrating only due to climate change according to the three categories. Only material from peer-reviewed literature is considered. The robustness of each category is: 1. The number of people in locations migrating now due to climate change only has high robustness. Nonetheless, new evidence could remove locations from this category. Around 2010, it became evident that the sea was encroaching so extensively onto the atoll of Takuu, PNG that migration would likely be inevitable. While some coastal management had exacerbated the situation, the main explanation based on available data--although not published in peer-reviewed literature--appeared to be sea-level rise associated with climate change. Mann et al.'s (2016) analysis agreed that sea-level rise is measurable around the atoll, but not that the shoreline changes are due to sea-level rise. Consequently, had this indicator been developed in 2015 including Takuu, then Takuu would have been removed in 2016. This situation is a further argument for focusing on peer-reviewed literature rather than on non-peer reviewed reports of local observations. 2. The number of people in locations who might possibly need to migrate due to climate change only has medium robustness. Due to lead-time available for this indicator, strong possibilities exist for taking measures to prevent inevitable 39	1
migration. In most locations, the need for such measures has been known over the past few decades with little action resulting. The current political climate is also not amenable to large-scale action for some time. Consequently, action is feasible to prevent migration, but does not seem likely before thermal expansion's impacts become apparent. 3. The number of people in locations who might possibly need to migrate due to ice sheet collapse has low robustness. Uncertainties are high while manifestation of ice sheet collapse on the century scale means that numerous other factors could influence possibilities for, preparation for, and reactions to migration related to ice sheet collapse.

Two atolls showed local human activities influencing the changes. Caveats from the literature regarding sea-level rise estimates: (a) Sea-level rise will not be the same everywhere, with significant regional variations from the global mean (Carson et al. 2016; Clarke et al. 2016). (b) The rate of sea-level rise is expected to accelerate in coming years (Fasllo et al. 2016; Watson 2016). 41	1
Sea-level rise is 0.71  0.20 mm/y slower than expected because the climate is driving increasing water storage on land (Reager et al., 2016). (d) Sea level might have natural, multi-decadal oscillations (Serazin et al., 2016). People from many locations are assumed to be migrating due to the possibilities given as being climate change only, but analysis shows that the assumptions are not always supported (Table 3). In fact, no outcome is certain. Even for coral reefs, Perry et al. (2015) postulate that coral growth under some scenarios could keep up with sea-level rise and other ecosystem changes. Corals' ability to flourish under rapid sea-level changes was demonstrated empirically in the Solomon Islands by Saunders et al. (2016) after sudden tectonic subsidence. Similarly, mangroves so far are demonstrating robustness to sea-level changes while nevertheless being damaged by human activity (Woodroffe et al. 2010). In summary, a linear cause-effect assumption is made of: climate change (impacts) migration health impacts Each step has nuances, subtleties, and provisos. For the first step, migration due to climate change (impacts) only is hard to discern because migration has always happened throughout human history for multiple reasons, some climate- and environment- related; some not linked at all to climate or environmental factors; and most often due to a combination of factors. Many assumptions behind migration potentially linked to climate change are hard to prove as being climate change only or are challenging to differentiate from many other environmental factors, such as specific natural hazards or changes to food, water, and/or livelihood conditions which manifest for multiple reasons. For the second step, migration itself, no matter how or why migration occurs, does not necessarily induce specific health outcomes. Migrant and host health could be improved, worsened, or not affected, depending on how the migration is handled.	1
Consequently, the main caveats for this indicator is that no linear cause-effect sequence happens, mainly because the outcomes from a situation depends much more on how a situation is dealt with than on climate change or migration per se. Two main prospects exist for this indicator's future. The first is observational. As estimates and observations of sea-level rise, ocean acidification, sea ice, and coastal erosion continue, the indicator's thresholds might change. The second is how the indicator is constructed. Consideration could be given to how managing migration affects health in order to overcome a principal caveat. Irrespective, this caveat can never be fully overcome because health impacts can be managed, if we choose to do so, irrespective of climate change or migration scenarios or realities. In later iterations of this indicator, descriptions can be provided of locations which have switched categories, been removed entirely, or been added as new. As these iterations approach 2030, the tables given for each indicator are likely to expand substantially because the number of studies is expanding immensely on (i) observed climate change impacts with confirmed attribution, (ii) projecting such impacts into the future; and (iii) migration linked to climate change. Consequently, the potential impacts of climate change on migration are likely to become much clearer towards 2030, including possible case studies where such migration has occurred. Caution is still needed regarding numerous cases where attribution is stated with confidence, but the link upon closer examination is not robust. While the indicator here is presented in 42	1
Given the complexity of the observational science and the challenges articulated by the caveats, the ideal form of this indicator given adequate time and resource would be a map of all potential migration location origins under different climate change scenarios, animated over time to 2100. Although climate change projections are published for the next 10,000 years (Clarke et al., 2016), social and technological changes will be immense over such time scales, making it difficult to provide any confidence for suggestions regarding how and where people will live and be responding to environmental stimuli long into the future. If people choose to settle other planets, solar systems, or galaxies over the next several millennia in order to escape a dying Earth--as much science fiction (not peer reviewed) has postulated-- would they be climate (change) migrants? Such questions are beyond the scope of Lancet Countdown. Consequently, to achieve this proposed map with scientific value, it should not go beyond 2100 and at least one dedicated post-doctoral researcher would be needed, preferably with a GIS and migration specialty because the number of caveats, provisos, uncertainties, and attribution challenges would lead to multiple layers and indicators on a map. Locations possibly needing to migrate due to climate change only The proviso `possibly' in this title refers to technical solutions being developed to help the people stay in or near their current locations, irrespective of the climate change factors mentioned. These schemes include artificial settlements floating above or built directly on the current locations (Yamamoto et al., 2014), whether above an island being submerged, an eroding coastline, or destabilised permafrost. Financing for these technical proposals has so far been absent and does not seem likely in the near future, plus technical challenges remain. Nonetheless, they are possibilities and it is difficult to project the social and political make-up of the world over the coming decades. The range of possibilities covers shifting the trillions of dollars per year in military spending and fossil fuel subsidies to tackling climate change all the way through to abandoning anyone affected by climate change through refusing to permit them entry into other countries. The most likely outcomes are somewhere in between such extremes. Consequently, the migration of these territories remains `possibly' rather than `definitely'. Additionally, defining `migrating' for this category is not straightforward. Does it mean moving house, street, municipality, island, or country? Would it include moving 5 m, 50 m, 500 m, or 5 km? For example Pingelap atoll in the Federated States of Micronesia has significant area above 15 m above sea level but all land is within 300 m of the coast. If the people of Pingelap move their houses or move to different houses due to sea-level rise, is that migration, because they are still living in effectively the same location? If so, then a street-by-street census would be needed of Pingelap and every other coastline in the world to determine exactly who would need to migrate, due to regional and local variations in how sea-level rise manifests. Consequently, a country rather than community level is presented (Table 4), identifying the countries which might (not definitely) not be able to remain as countries under thermal expansion. Apart from those people already migrating due to 43	1
climate change, this indicator yields four countries totalling a population of 584,000 people possibly needing to migrate due to thermal expansion. All four are small island developing states (SIDS), but this is coincidental; all countries have been considered. Table 4. Locations possibly needing to migrate due to thermal expansion Location Kiribati	1
Notes Has plenty of high ground above 10 m above sea level, but little is habitable or viable for large populations. Highest point is 2.4 m above sea level. Highest point is 10 m above sea level.	1
As a guess, the countries in Table 4 would need to migrate between 2040 and 2050. This statement is a guess, because the decision to migrate will most likely be political strongly influenced by specific extreme events rather than a strategic analysis of possible futures and outcomes from those futures. This statement is made on the basis of history and how societies have typically dealt with disasters and creeping environmental changes. As well, other countries could rapidly be added to Table 4. If coral reefs around Fiji or Seychelles experience high mortality, then near-coastal areas could potentially experience rapid erosion. Two provisos preclude large numbers of people in each country, or significant parts thereof, from being forced to migrate. First, while far from an ideal approach, extensive coastal engineering (which both countries already implement) could forestay major coastal erosion. Second, plenty of land is available in those countries which could theoretically take migrants--although with practical problems regarding access, ownership, and heritage protection--and few people would necessarily need to migrate far in theory, leading to the problem of defining `migration' mentioned above. If land tenure or ecosystem protection precludes settling in areas, is the root cause of migration farther afield climate change or local human decisions regarding land? All these factors emphasise the `possibly' word in this indicator's title. They also highlight that this indicator's value is a minimum, but many more possibilities for migrants exist under this category--most notably erosion linked to sea ice disappearance. Locations which might possibly need to migrate only due to climate change, if ice sheet collapse occurs In the coming decades, the numbers of people migrating due to ice sheet collapse is likely to be near zero. The reason is that the collapse process itself followed by ice melt and sea-level rise takes a minimum of decades and possibly up to centuries. As we move from the decade scale to the century scale, it is impossible to project social and technological developments. It is too simplistic and it would be indefensible to just calculate the number of people living within a certain elevation above sea level-- especially since over the coming decades, these population numbers will change. Nonetheless, some websites host data on population in coastal zones such as Columbia University	1
_coasts/pop_coastal_areas.pdf into which the World Bank and Columbia University data input, but again, it is not published in the peer-reviewed literature. Instead, peerreviewed publications provide the following analyses: * In 1990, 450 million people lived within 20 km coast and below 20 m above sea level (Small and Nicholls, 2003). The provided plots permit higher resolution estimates to be obtained with reasonable precision, but accuracy is questionable. * In 1994, 1.88 billion people (33.5% of the global population) lived below 100 m above sea level (Cohen and Small, 1998), which was the highest vertical resolution investigated. * In 2000, 634 million (10% of the global population), of whom 360 million are urban, lived below 10 m above sea level (McGranahan et al., 2007), which was the highest vertical resolution investigated. * With 2000 as a baseline, the population living below 10 m above sea level and connected to the ocean will change from 638 million to, depending on the societal scenario chosen, 1,005-1,091 million by 2050 and 830-1,184 million by 2100 (Merkins et al., 2016). * With 2000 as a baseline, the population living below 10 m above sea level on contiguous land which borders a major body of water will change from 702.167 million to, depending on the societal scenario chosen, 492.74-1,145.946 million by 2100 (Jones and O'Neill, 2016). * The number of people living below 5 m above sea level is calculated to be 290 million (5.4%) in 1990, 380 million (5.6%) in 2010, and 460 million (5.5%) in 2030 (Kummu et al. 2016). * For 2000-2006, 67.1-153.1 million people live below 1 m above sea level; 308.1-391.4 million people live below 5 m above sea level; and 557.1-709.1 million people live below 10 m above sea level (values are also available for below 2, 3, and 4 m above sea level) depending on the models used (Lichter et al. 2011). This paper also provides a review of similar literature to date, which plenty of further estimates of the coastal population. Consequently, this indicator yields zero extra people migrating due to ice sheet collapse by 2100; that is, no one would need to migrate who is not already migrating. After 2100 and in ensuing centuries--without appropriate action--based on the above literature, as an order of magnitude, perhaps over one billion people +/- 50% might need to migrate due to ice sheet collapse. This estimate is based on ice sheet collapse only; as noted above, has low robustness because it is mainly guesswork with large errors; and has no relation to the estimates of `climate migrants' and `climate change refugees' which have been debunked by Gemenne (2011) and Hartmann (2010). Instead, it simply states that if ice sheets collapse and in the absence of major social and technological changes (an unlikely situation by 2100), then in the decades and centuries after 2100, over one billion people +/- 50% might need to migrate due to climate change only.	1
2: Adaptation Planning and Resilience for Health 2.1 National adaptation plans for health In May 2008, the 193 Member States of WHO passed a World Health Assembly (WHA) Resolution 61.19, calling for stronger action to address the health risks associated with climate change both through adaptation and mitigation responses. In addition, the WHO work plan on Climate Change and Health EB136/16 calls for promotion and development of tools for more systematic provision of countryspecific information and monitoring of progress. As part of the fulfilment of this mandate, WHO is actively engaged in the United Nations framework Convention on Climate Change and together, WHO and the UNFCCC collaborated on the development of climate and health country profiles to provide ministers of health and health decision-makers with national estimates of the climate hazards, health impacts, potential health co-benefits of mitigation actions and status of national policy response in their countries. The collection of data for this exercise includes a biennial national survey, entitled the "WHO Climate and Health Country Survey", which is sent to all WHO member states and is completed by ministry of health focal points. Results from the country survey together with 46	1
the WHO Climate and Health Country Profiles form the basis of WHO's global monitoring of national progress on climate and health action. The data presented in this report reflect the responses of 40 countries that participated in the 2015 baseline WHO Climate and Health Country Survey. Validation of the 2015 country reported data was undertaken as part of the development and review of the WHO UNFCCC Climate and Health Country Profiles. Key climate and health stakeholders including the ministry of health and other related government bodies were invited to review country specific findings. The validated data presented in this report are for 40 countries, including; Algeria, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji, France, Germany, Ghana, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Jordan, Kenya, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tanzania (United Republic of), Thailand, TimorLeste, Tunisia, Uganda, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.	1
WHO Climate and Health Country Survey The survey sample may not be representative of all countries as this survey was voluntary, and the baseline sample tended to include countries that had active climate and health projects or countries that were working directly with WHO on climate and health projects. As such the overall results may tend to be positively biased but still provide valuable insights into the status of national policy response for participating countries from all WHO regions and representing a diverse range of low, middle and high income nations with varying population sizes, climatic and geographic characteristics and different vulnerabilities to the impacts of climate change. The WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will be conducted biennially and will aim to gather data from all WHO member States, with the specific goal of doubling the number of survey respondents to 80 participating member states in the next iteration of the survey (2017).	1
2: Adaptation Planning and Resilience for Health 2.2 City-level climate change risk assessments CDP serves as an official reporting platform for the Compact of Mayors, and administrates, collects and analyses a global survey of city based environmental and climate change data on an annual basis. In 2016, 553 cities participated in the survey, with 449 reporting publically that included questions on emissions, adaptation assessments and plans. Respondents to the surveys to describe the magnitude of the 47	1
Based on this data two indicators can be developed. The first is a global cities based indicator of government areas that have undertaken a climate change risk or vulnerability assessment. The second is global cities based indicator of the perceived vulnerability of health infrastructure to climate change. CDP data cities This is a sample survey of 449 public results, are self-reported. As such, the results are not representative and are not necessarily reliable, owing to their being based on self-reporting cities. In future, this indicator will aim to expand the number of cities included in the survey and to have a more regionally representative sample. Also, the quality of the climate change risk assessments and implementation rate of any associated plans would be important to analyse. Cities that noted that Health & Community are threatened by Climate change Number Percentage Yes	1
2: Adaptation Planning and Resilience for Health 2.3 Detection, preparedness, and response to health emergencies Under the International Health Regulations (IHR (2005)) all States Parties are required to have or to develop minimum core public health capacities to implement the IHR (2005) effectively. IHR (2005) also states that all States Parties should report	1
to the World Health Assembly annually on the implementation of IHR (2005). In order to facilitate this process, WHO developed an IHR Monitoring questionnaire 2, interpreting the Core Capacity Requirements in Annex 1 of IHR (2005) into 20 indicators for 13 capacities. Since 2010, this self-reporting IHR monitoring questionnaire is sent annually to National IHR Focal Points (NFPs) for data collection. It contains a checklist of 20 indicators specifically developed for monitoring the development and implementation of 13 IHR capacities. The method of estimation calculates the proportion/percentage of attributes (a set of specific elements or functions which reflect the level of performance or achievement of a specific indicator) reported to be in place in a country. The core capacities to implement the International Health Regulations (2005) have been established by a technical group of experts, as those capacities required to detect, assess, notify and report events, and to respond to public health risks and emergencies of national and international concern. To assess the development and strengthening of core capacities, a set of components are measured for each of the core capacities, by considering a set of one to three indicators that measure the status and progress in developing and strengthening the IHR core capacities. Each indicator is assessed by using a group of specific elements referred to as `attributes' that represents a complex set of activities or elements required to carry out this component. As it is difficult to measure these indicators with a simple question that requires one `yes' or `no' answer, one to three questions are derived from each attribute, and these are administered through a questionnaire. The status of performance for an indicator, component and core capacity is determined by the presence of attributes. If a country does not indicate a particular attribute as absent or present, it is counted as absent for scoring purposes. The annual questionnaire has been conducted since 2010 with a response rate of 72% in 2012, 66% in 2016, and 99% of countries reporting at least once since 2010. Annual reporting results are complemented by after action reviews, simulation exercises, and joint external evaluation (JEE). International Health Regulations (2005) Annual Reporting This indicator does not show the implementation status of IHR core capacities for all countries - it only reports on those countries who reported. In future, this indicator would hope to consider additional data sources beyond the IHR Reporting Questionnaires and expand the number of countries included in the results, to strengthen the global picture of the available human resources to prepare, respond and adapt to climate-related health impacts. Closer alignment will be sought with the monitoring of SDG 3D, "Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks". Indicator 3.D.1 is also measured by: "International Health Regulations (IHR) capacity and health emergency preparedness." The indicator may be expanded to include more detailed information provided through the complementary IHR joint external evaluation instruments; or the monitoring systems for the Sendai Framework 3, including data from WHO's reports on country capacities for health emergency and disaster risk management, which may in the future provide a complementary system to track health outcomes, effects on health services and the community and national capacities to manage the health risks of climate related emergencies and disasters. Furthermore, this indicator could	1

2: Adaptation Planning and Resilience for Health 2.4 Climate information services for health In 2015, the most recent year for which data are available, a total of 104 Members (54%) provided survey results. Response rates were 53% for Africa, 44% for Asia, 75% for South America, 68% North America, Central America and the Caribbean, 29% for the South-West Pacific, and 63% for Europe. This indicator measures the number of members (NHMS) who report to provide targeted/tailored climate information, products, and services to support user requirements in their countries for adaptation and climate risk management in key socio-economic sectors. Data were processed by WHO to focus on the proportion of countries that report providing tailored climate information, products and services to their public health sector.

WHO Climate and Health Country Survey See description of caveats provided for indicator 2.1 above. The WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will be conducted biennially and will aim to gather data from all WHO member States, with the specific goal of doubling the number of survey respondents to 80 participating member states in the next iteration of the survey (2017). The 2017 country survey will not only gather data on the number of countries that have conducted a national assessment, but also on the use of assessment outcomes to inform policy and the allocation of financial and human resources in the health sector. Furthermore, this indicator could in future look to include more details of these national assessments, including how regularly they are updated; if there has been any action resulting from these assessments to address problems identified; and the involvement of health professionals in developing, undertaking and understanding these assessments. 2: Adaptation Planning and Resilience for Health 2.6 Climate-resilient health infrastructure See description of methods provided for indicator 2.1 above. WHO Climate and Health Country Survey See description of caveats provided for indicator 2.1 above. The WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will be conducted biennially and will aim to gather data from all WHO member States, with the specific goal of doubling the number of survey respondents to 80 participating member states in the next iteration of the survey (2017). Future iterations of the WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will aim to collect data on whether national assessments of the climate resilience of health infrastructure and technology have been conducted and to what extent. Additionally, countries will be asked to report on the specific measures that have been taken to increase climate resilience of health infrastructure including the development of contingency plans to ensure access to and evacuation of hospital sites and the equipment of critical technologies, systems and services to continue functioning despite extreme climate-related events.	1

The WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will also aim to investigate more closely the use of climate information in the health sector. Countries will be asked to report whether climate information (short-term, seasonal or long-term data) is currently being used in surveillance, early warning and communication systems for specific climate-sensitive diseases and health outcomes, such as thermal stress, vector-borne diseases and air pollution.	1
3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.1: Carbon intensity of the energy system Technical definition is the tonnes of CO emitted for each unit (TJ) of primary energy supplied. The rationale for the indicator choice is that carbon intensity of the energy system will provide information on the level of fossil fuel use, which have associated air pollution impacts. Higher intensity values indicate a more fossil dominated system, and one that is likely to have a higher coal share. As countries pursue climate mitigation goals, the carbon intensity is likely to reduce with benefits for air pollution. The indicator is calculated based on total CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion divided by Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES). TPES reflects the total amount of primary energy used in a specific country, accounting for the flow of energy imports and exports.	1
The data are available for most countries of the world, for the period 19712013. This indicator is based on based on the energy balances from the International Energy Agency. The source reference is: International Energy Agency (2016): CO2 Emissions From Fuel Combustion: CO2 Indicators (Data downloaded: 10 March 2017). UK Data Service. The indicator does not provide information on the share of different fossil fuels, their use in different sectors, and the absolute levels of usage. These are all important elements in understanding the air pollution emissions, 54	1
and their impacts. Therefore, additional indicators (3.2 & 3.3) provide additional complimentary information. This indicator will need to be updated to provide the data for the most recent years, which have seen important shifts in the use of fossil fuels, particularly coal. 3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.2. Coal phase-out. Two indicators are used here; i) Total primary coal supply by region / country (in EJ units), and ii) Share of electricity generation from coal (% of total generation from coal). These indicators are important for enable a tracking of change in coal consumption at a regional and country level. Due to the level of coal used for power generation, a second indicator tracks the contribution to electricity generation from coal power plants in selected countries. As countries pursue climate mitigation goals, the use of coal is likely to reduce with benefits for air pollution. The indicator on primary energy coal supply is an aggregation of all coal types used across all sectors (from the IEA energy balances). The indicator on the share of electricity generation from coal is estimated based on electricity generated from coal plant as a percentage of total electricity generated.	1
The data are available for most countries of the world, for the period 19712013. Only the period from 1990 has been used, due to data gaps for selected countries prior to 1990. Countries with large levels of coal use (as a share of generation, or in absolute terms), have been selected. This indicator is based on based on the energy balances from the International Energy Agency. The source reference is: For total primary coal supply - International Energy Agency (2015): Coal Information: World Coal Supply, 1960-2013 (Data downloaded: 11 November 2015). UK Data Service.	1
For data to compile share of electricity from coal generation - International Energy Agency (2015): World Energy Balances: Extended Energy Balances, 1960-2014 (Data downloaded: 15 October 2015). UK Data Service. These indicators provides a proxy for air quality emissions associated with the combustion of coal. Further work is required to convert coal use by sector and type into emissions of different air quality pollutants. In the future, this indicator set could be developed to also estimate the actual air pollutant emissions associated with coal use. This will require sectoral use, coal type (both of which are available) and appropriate emission factors. As per 3.1, this indicator will need to be updated to provide the data for the most recent years, which have seen important shifts in the use of coal.	1
3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.3. Zero-carbon emission electricity. Two indicators are used here, and presented in two ways; i) Total low carbon electricity generation, in absolute terms (TWh) and as a % share of total electricity generated (to include nuclear, and all renewables), and ii) Total renewable generation (excluding hydro), in TWh, and as a % share of total electricity generated. The increase in the use of low carbon and renewable energy for electricity generation will push other fossil fuels, such as coal, out of the mix over time, resulting in an improvement in air quality, with benefits to health. The renewables (excluding hydro) indicator has been used to allow for the tracking of rapidly emergent renewable technologies. For both indicators, generation, rather than capacity, has been chosen as a metric as the electricity generated from these technologies is what actually displaces fossil-based generation. Countries with large levels of low carbon generation (as shares, or in absolute terms), or with higher fossil dependency, have been selected. The data are again taken from the IEA energy balances. The absolute level indicators are total gross electricity generated aggregated from the relevant technology types. The share indicators are estimated as the low carbon or renewable generation as a % of total generation.	1
The data are available for most countries of the world, for the period 19712013. Only the period from 1990 has been used, due to data gaps for selected countries prior to 1990. This indicator is based on based on the energy balances from the International Energy Agency. The source reference is: For specific renewable and nuclear generation levels - International Energy Agency (2015): World Energy Balances: Extended Energy Balances, 19602014 (Data downloaded: 15 October 2015). UK Data Service,	1
For total electricity generated - International Energy Agency (2015): Electricity Information: World Electricity and Heat Supply and Consumption, 1960-2014 (Data downloaded: 11 November 2015). This indicator set does not provide information on the air pollutant emissions displaced due to the increasing share of RE generation. This set should be developed to include an indicator to assess the direct impact on air quality emissions from additional low carbon generation, one approach being to compare the emission intensity of the current system with a counterfactual case, which does not have the additional share of RE generation. 3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.4. Access to clean energy Definition: "The proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology is calculated as the number of people using clean 56	1
The indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO. Estimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban and rural population for a given year are obtained separately using a multilevel model (Bonjour et al., 2013)[1]. This is done at the country level. Estimates of fuel use are derived from WHO household survey data from ~800 nationally representative survey and censuses, including Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), and others. For cooking fuels, coverage of 157 countries is available through the WHO Global Household Energy Database. For lighting fuels, the WHO database includes data for 76 countries. For heating fuels, the WHO database includes data for 16 countries. Time series:	1
From 1980 to 2014 The indicator is based on the main type of fuel and technology used for cooking as cooking occupies the largest share of overall household energy needs. However, this will not reflect household fuel use activities when multiple fuels are used through the day or year. There is also a lack of data on the type of fuel and technologies used for home heating and lighting. An ideal indicator going forward be further details on the fuel mix used by households for different demands (heating, cooling, cooking, hot water, lighting and other plug loads) for a range of income groupings within the country. The pressures of interest are the GHG and air pollution emissions that contribute to climate change and health outcomes, but also the increased access to energy use, which has broader socio-economic benefits.	1
Data on annual average concentration of fine particulate (PM2.5) air pollution in urban areas was compiled from the latest version of the WHO's Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database (2016 update). The database assembled air pollution data from public data sources including national/subnational reports and websites, regional networks, agencies (e.g. UN), and academic publications. The database contains estimated annual mean PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in almost 3,000 cities in 103 countries covering the period 2008 to 2015. The cities included in this indicator are 143 cities from the Sustainable Healthy Urban Environments (SHUE) database for which there was an air pollution estimate in the WHO data. SHUE is an initiative, funded by the Wellcome Trust, to support policy development in areas relating to environmental and health challenges and opportunities in cities. It aims to test the feasibility and methods of assembling data about the characteristics of a globally distributed sample of cities, and the populations within them, for comparative analyses, and to use such data to assess how policies may contribute to sustainable urban development and human health. Data on city-level GDP for SHUE cities were compiled from various sources, including the Brookings Institute, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and World Bank. Where city-level data was unavailable, regional or national data was used.	1
This indicator focuses specifically on the links between the energy sector and primary air pollution production, with data, analysis and projections in the report including energy production, transformation and use (i.e. the entire energy value chain, from extraction to final use). This coverage includes both combustion and non-combustion emissions (e.g. process emissions in industry, non-tailpipe emissions in transport) Data are broadly only specific to countries/regions (United States, Latin America, European Union, Middle East Africa, Russia, China, India, Southeast Asia) Updating of the data outputs is sporadic - the IEA publication was a "special report" and not a routine publication.	1
An ideal indicator would directly map sources of primary air pollution to exposures and attributable health impacts on a country-level or more granularly. Furthermore, it would disaggregate air pollution sources by type (e.g. coal-fired power plant, cars) and include sources outside of the energy sector. In turn, it would be able to quantify the co-impacts on air quality and human health directly resulting from climate change mitigation efforts both in and outside of the energy sector.	1
Estimates of sectoral source contributions to annual mean exposure to ambient PM2.5 were calculated using the GAINS model (Amann et al., 2011), which combines bottom-up emission calculations with atmospheric chemistry and dispersion coefficients. Atmospheric transfer coefficients are based on full year simulations with the EMEP Chemistry Transport Model (Simpson et al. 2012) at 0.5x0.5 resolution using meteorology of 2015 and include a downscaling to capture sub-grid urban concentration gradients. Calculated ambient PM2.5 concentrations have been validated against in-situ observations from the latest version of the WHO's Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database (2016 update), and other sources where available (e.g. Chinese statistical yearbook). Premature deaths from total ambient PM2.5 are calculated using the methodology of the WHO (2016) assessment on the burden of disease from ambient air pollution, which relies on integrated exposure response relationships (IERs) developed within the Global Burden of Disease 2013 59	1
study (Forouzanfar et al., 2015). Disease and age specific baseline mortality rates are taken from the GBD Results database ( Attribution of estimated premature deaths from AAP to polluting sectors was done proportional to the contributions of individual sectors to population-weighted mean PM2.5 in each country. Caveats	1
The indicator relies on model calculations which are currently available for a limited set of countries (Europe, South Asia, East Asia) uncertainty in the shape of integrated exposure-response relationships (IERs) make the quantification of health burden inherently uncertain	1
The non-linearity of the IERs used complicates the translation between the mortality burden attributed to an individual source, which is calculated proportional to the source contribution to ambient PM2.5, and the effect of mitigating this source. While a reduction of emissions would lead to a (roughly) proportional reduction of ambient PM2.5, this would not result in a proportional reduction of the health burden. In highly polluted environments, the health benefits of a marginal reduction of emissions would be disproportionately smaller than the relative change in concentrations. Future development of indicator	1
An ideal indicator would provide a marker of benefits for air quality and/or health that are directly attributable to climate change mitigation action, which requires scenario analysis. Going beyond a sectoral split, a more explicit quantification of effects of fossil-fuel versus non-fossil fuel based activities should be undertaken. The spatial coverage should be expanded to global coverage, and other health indicators than premature deaths should be included for a more complete assessment of the health burden, particularly Years of Life Lost (YLLs) and Years Lived with Disability (YLDs).	1
3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.6. Clean fuel use for transport Fuel use data (by fuel type) from the IEA datasets are divided by corresponding population statistics from the World Bank. International Energy Agency (2015): World Energy Balances: Extended Energy Balances, 1960-2014 (Data downloaded: 15 October 2015). UK Data Service, DOI:  and World Bank, World Development Indicators, Version: 27 April 2017	1
The IEA dataset contains annual time series data for over the 30 OECD Member countries and 105 non-OECD countries world-wide. In OECD Member Countries, data are collected by official bodies (most often the national statistics office in each country) from firms, government agencies and industry organisations and are then reported to the IEA using questionnaires to ensure international comparability. In non-OECD countries the data are collected directly from government and industry 60	1
The World Bank dataset is updated quarterly and contains data compiled from officially-recognized international sources including the (1) United Nations Population Division. World Population Prospects, (2) census reports and other statistical publications from national statistical offices, (3) Eurostat: Demographic Statistics, (4) United Nations Statistical Division. Population and Vital Statistics Report, (5) U.S. Census Bureau: International Database, and (6) Secretariat of the Pacific Community: Statistics and Demography Programme. It includes national, regional and global estimates. This indicator does not explicitly quantify the impact associated with transitioning to transport fuels that are less polluting, though it does provide trends that can be used as a proxy. It also cannot, at this time, be disaggregated to the urban level. An ideal indicator would capture the direct health impacts of the use of transport fuels, with country- and urban-level specificity within the global coverage. In turn, the co-benefits of transitioning to less-polluting fuels would be quantified directly in terms of reduced exposures to air pollution and their corresponding health impact.	1
This indicator measures the proportion of journeys by travel mode (private transport, public transport, walking and cycling) in selected cities. An additional figure examines trends in modal share over time.	1

Santiago: Institute for Mobility Research (2016) Mobility trends in cutting edge cities; Dictuc S.A. (1992) Estudio Encuesta origen destino de viajes del Gran Santiago, 1991 This indicator provides information on sustainable travel uptake using available data on the proportion of all journeys in world cities made by private transport, public transport, walking and cycling. Both single year estimates of modal share and trends in modal share have a number of 62	1
The data presented in this indicator include the most recent data available for a particular city. Transport surveys in different cities and countries have different methods, which may limit comparability. Transport surveys also tend to undercount short trips (particularly those made by foot), with the amount of bias likely to vary between surveys. Data on modal share classifies journeys by the main mode of travel. The main mode of travel is typically the mode that covers the most distance. This way of classifying journeys misses some sustainable travel that takes place as part of longer journeys with multiple stages. For instance, driving to a public transport station near the edge of the city and continuing the journey by public transport. Data does not take into account distance travelled	1
Data on trends in modal share has the additional caveat: The methodology of transport surveys changes over time, which may limit comparability even within one city. Future development of indicator	1
The data currently included in this indicator come from an initial scoping of available data. An ideal indicator would include data from a systematic search of travel data in all selected cities and countries. This may involve contacting survey teams in different countries to provide estimates or access to the desired data. To more fully capture sustainable uptake a future indicator could collate data on the proportion of total distance travelled made by different modes of transport. Other data on sustainable travel infrastructure, for instance, the presence of cycle schemes would be useful.	1
Total amount of ruminant meat available for consumption (kg/capita/year) and proportion of energy available from ruminant meat for human consumption (%) compared to all sources of energy, aggregated by WHO region from country-specific data over 1990-2013.	1
Data comes from UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Food Balance Sheets. The country-specific data was compiled by the statistics division of the FAO from the national supply and utilization accounts of primary foods and processed commodities, adding food imports, subtracting food exports, food fed to animals, and waste/losses (assumed as 10%), adjusting for changes in food stocks, and dividing country population (mostly mid-year population estimates).	1
estimating emissions over time. Although we used the amount and proportion of energy from ruminant meat as a proxy indicator for food groups with some of the highest levels of GHG emissions, it is important to note that emissions are also high for other food groups, especially from other meat and dairy products. The graphs below show the proportion of energy available from animal products and the proportion of protein available from animal products. The proportion of energy available from animal products is highest in the Americas, where trends suggest a slight increase, and Europe, where trends suggest a slight decrease. Proportions are notably low in South East Asia. Trends suggest proportion of energy from animal products is increasing most rapidly in the Western Pacific with slower increases apparent in the Eastern Mediterranean and South East Asia. The proportion of protein avaialbe from animal products follows similar trends to the proportion of energy from animal products: highest in the Americas and Europe, lowest in South East Asia, and growing most rapidly in the Western Pacific. These measures on animal product availability may be useful for tracking progress on shifting away from animal intensive products to more a more plant based diets. However, since the evidence relating consumption of non-red meat and dairy products to adverse health outcomes is currently less clear than for consumption of red meat, we did not include any measure of animal product availability in the core indicators.	1
An ideal method for tracking progress would use a set of indicators reflecting climate and health progress at each level of the DPSEEA framework. For the development of such indicators, considerable effort is required in terms of systematic data collection (e.g. emission and actual food intake data) and methodological developments for context-sensitive data collection, monitoring, and definition of targets for sustainable food production and consumption, particularly in terms of GHG-intensity and health impact.	1
Data from the UK comes from published reports from the Sustainable Development Unit (NHS). Estimates of GHG emissions include emissions from building energy use, travel to and from sites, and goods and services purchased from the health care sector. Data from the US comes from an article by Eckelman & Sherman (2016) [3]. Estimates are modelled using data on health care expenditures. Data from Australia comes from a published report from the Department of Health in Victoria. Estimates take into account GHG associated with products and food purchased by one municipality (Southern Health), waste, and transportation. To extrapolate to the whole Victorian Health system estimates from Southern Health were scaled up to all of Victoria using separations (as a measure of activity) and floor area.	1
A future set of indicators would reflect country-wide GHG emissions of health care systems with denominators of the system size and volume of health care service provision. Indicators should be available at each level of policy and managerial decision-making to inform choices and facilitate selection of policies and organizational operations with lowest GHG emission levels. Additionally, efficiency of health care system performance in relation to climate change can be evaluated by modelling global health risks attributed to the GHG emissions of each health care system as a proportion of their contribution to the health of the population. Mitigation strategies could be designed in collaboration with relevant sectors, such as the insurance sector or health care commissioners and providers.	1

4. Economics and Finance 4.1. Investments in Zero-Carbon Energy and Energy Efficiency The data for this indicator are sourced from the annual IEA World Energy Investment publication. Four categories of investment are defined: Renewables & Nuclear - investment in all renewable and nuclear electricity generation, and renewable transport and heating (including biofuels and solar thermal heating) Energy Efficiency - See below. Electricity Networks - investment in electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure. Fossil Fuels - including oil, gas and coal, upstream mining, drilling and pipeline infrastructure, and coal, gas and oil power and other energy generation capacity. For most sectors, `investment' is defined as overnight capital expenditures on new assets. For some sectors, such as power generation, this investment is attributed to the year in which a new plant or the upgrade of an existing one becomes operational. For other sources, such as upstream oil and gas and LNG projects, where sufficient data are available, investment reflects the capital spending incurred over time as production from a new source ramps up to maintain output from an existing asset. For energy efficiency, `investment' is defined as incremental spending by companies, governments and individuals to acquire equipment that consumes less energy than that which they would otherwise have bought. Other areas of expenditure, including operation and maintenance, research and development, financing costs, mergers and acquisitions or public markets transactions, are not included. Investment estimates are derived from IEA data for energy demand, supply and trade, and estimates of unit capacity costs, For more information, see IEA (2016 i,2017 ii). Here, `renewables and nuclear' includes investment in all renewable and nuclear electricity generation capacity, and renewable transport and heating (including biofuels and solar thermal heating). `Electricity networks' includes investment in electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure. Investment in fossil fuels includes upstream mining, drilling and pipeline infrastructure for oil, gas and coal, and power and other energy generation capacity for the use of these fuels. For these categories, investment' is defined as overnight capital expenditures on new assets. For energy efficiency, `investment' is defined as incremental spending by companies, governments and individuals to acquire equipment that consumes less energy than that which they would otherwise have bought.	1
4. Economics and Finance 4.3. Funds Divested from Fossil Fuels The data for this indicator are collected and provided by 350.org. iii They represent the total assets (or assets under management, AUM) for institutions that have publicly committed to divest in 2016 (for which data is available), with non-US$ values converted using the market exchange rate when the commitment was made, and thus do not directly represent the actual sums divested from fossil fuel companies. A company is committed to `divestment' if it falls into any of the following five categories: - `Fossil Free' - An institution or corporation that does not have any investments (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual funds containing shares, corporate bonds) in fossil fuel companies (coal, oil, natural gas) and committed to avoid any fossil fuel investments in the future - `Full' - An institution or corporation that made a binding commitment to divest (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual funds containing 72	1
- `Coal only' - An institution or corporation that made a binding commitment to divest (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual funds containing shares, corporate bonds) from any coal companies. Due to confidentiality issue, the full dataset is not available for publication. However, interested readers may visit the 350.org website for further information. I See `Methods'. The ideal future form of this indicator would have two elements. The first element would track the value of institutional investments in fossil fuels assets, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of their total portfolios. This would also allow for tracking of associated funds that are moved out of fossil fuels, but are not explicitly advertised as `divesting'. However, such data is unlikely to be available. As such, an indicator that aligns with the data compiled by Bouvet, L and Kirjanas, P. (2017) iv will be investigated. The second element of this indicator would more explicitly track the value of funds divested from fossil fuels by healthcare institutions. The data provided for the indicator in this paper may be improved upon through, for example, the issuance of annual surveys either as part of other data collection efforts from healthcare institutions, or independently. The feasibility of each option will be investigated for future publications. Just 17 organisations recorded as committed to divestment above are `forprofit' corporations (however, these account for $3.16 trillion (58%) of the total asset value presented above). Pension funds and other institutional investors (for example, insurance companies), which in 2013 held assets under management worth $93 trillion in the OECD alone (larger than the sum of global economic output in that year - $76.8 trillion), also account for a small proportion of the organisations committed to divestment (12% at the end of 2016).232,233 Institutional investors are substantial investors in fossil fuel companies, due to the historically sizable, yet stable returns generated. Policy makers are increasingly keen to encourage (or require) institutional investors to properly assess and disclose their exposure to climate-related risk. In December 2015, the Financial Stability Board established the `Task Force on Climate-Related Finance Disclosures', with the aim of developing financial risk assessment and disclosure approaches related to the physical, liability and transition risks associated with climate change. In June 2017, the Task Force published their final report on recommendations to achieve this objective.234,235 In January 2017, the European Union (EU) introduced 73	1
4. Economics and Finance 4.4. Economic Losses due to Climate-Related Events Munch Re NatCatSERVICE provided the data for this indicator. The NatCatSERVICE is a global database of natural catastrophe (`nat cat') data. Munich Re has been systematically recording information on natural catastrophe loss events from around the world since 1994. This has developed into one of the world's most comprehensive databases for information on natural catastrophe loss events. Data suitable for systematic and analytical evaluation on a worldwide scale are available from 1980 onwards. For this paper, a base year of 1990 was chosen in order to align with the base year against which GHG emission reduction targets are commonly set. NatCatSERVICE collect a range of information for around 1,200 events each year. For this paper, aside from descriptive and locational information, only data on direct economic loss (physical/tangible losses, expressed in US$2016), insured losses (all paid-out insured physical/tangible losses) and fatalities are used. Please refer to the online NatCatSERVICE Methodology document, which may be found online ( The Table below illustrates the `peril classification' provided by NatCatSERVICE. Perils classified as Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological have been included in the analysis. Geophysical perils are excluded, due to their general independence from climate change. Family	1
Each natural catastrophe event recorded is assigned a direct economic loss, and where applicable, an insured loss, expressed in nominal US$ values. Where these are available, data are taken from official institutions, but where not, estimates are calculated. The process for estimation calculation depends on what data is available. For example, if loss estimates from insurance market data is available, this data may be combined with data on insurance penetration and other eventspecific information to estimate total economic losses. If only low-quality information is available, such as a description of the number of homes damaged or destroyed, assumptions on value and costs are made. Loss values are presented in US$, or if initially expressed in local currency, converted to US$ using the market exchange rates at the end of the month when the event occurred. Values are converted to US$2016 using country-specific Consume Price Indices (CPI). Once the data was received from the NatCatSERVICE, further analysis was undertaken. Firstly, each country was assigned to its income group as defined by the World Bank. Secondly, to allow `intensity' calculations as illustrated in Figure 2, economic losses (insured and uninsured) were divided by annual GDP values for each income grouping, sourced from the World Bank Database and deflated to US$2016 using data sourced from the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis. v 2016 data for GDP is estimated by multiplying the 2015 value by the average annual the growth rate from the previous 5 years. Fatality data were divided by the relevant annual population of each income grouping, also sourced from the World Bank Database (with 2016 data estimated using same approach as for GDP). Values presented in the paper text are rounded to the nearest 0.05.	1
4. Economics and Finance 4.5. Employment in Low-Carbon and High-Carbon Sectors The data for this indicator is sourced from IRENA (2017) vi (renewables) and IBISWorld (2016 vii; 2017 viii) (fossil fuel extraction). Bioenergy includes liquid biofuels, solid biomass and biogas. `Other technologies' includes geothermal energy, small hydropower, concentrated solar power, municipal and industrial waste, and ocean energy. Fossil fuel extraction values include direct employment, whereas renewable energy jobs include direct and indirect employment (e.g. equipment manufacturing).	1
The data for this indictor is sourced from IRENA (renewables) and IBIS World (fossil fuel extraction). 25,26, 27 Bioenergy includes liquid biofuels, soil biomass and biogas. `Other technologies' includes geothermal energy, small hydropower, concentrated solar power, municipal and industrial waste, and ocean energy. Fossil fuel extraction values include direct employment, whereas renewable energy jobs include direct and indirect employment (e.g. equipment manufacturing). Fossil fuel extraction values include direct employment, whereas renewable energy jobs include direct and indirect employment (e.g. equipment manufacturing). An ideal future form of this indicator would track both direct and indirect employment from the renewables and fossil fuel extraction industries, along with the geographical distribution in their change over time. This would allow for an assessment of substitution. However, at present such data is unavailable, and impractical to collect for the purposes of the Lancet Countdown alone. 4. Economics and Finance 4.6. Fossil Fuel Subsidies The data for this indicator are taken from the International Energy Agency (IEA), and is calculated using the price-gap approach, for 42 mostly nonOECD countries (see data below). The `price-gap' approach is the most commonly applied methodology for quantifying consumption subsidies. It compares average end-user prices paid by consumers with reference prices that correspond to the full cost of supply. The price gap is the amount by which an end-use price falls short of the reference price and its existence indicates the presence of a subsidy. Prices are converted to US2016 using data sourced from the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis.v To view the original data, a full description of the price-gap approach and the data employed to calculate it, please see IEA (2017) ix IEA Data (US$2016) Country Algeria	1
The data for this indicator is provided by the IEA, and calculated using the price-gap approach, for 42 mostly non-OECD countries (see Appendix 5 for further details). Fossil fuel production subsidies and consumption subsidies for most OECD countries are not included, due to the lack of consistent data. However, the vast majority of fossil fuel subsidies are consumer subsidies in non-OECD countries. In 2014, consumer subsidies in OECD countries were worth less than 14% of the non-OECD value, with producer subsidies worth around 4%.248 As such, the indicator presented provides a broad overview of global trends in fossil fuel subsidies. An ideal future form of this indicator would have two key elements. The first element would be the consistent inclusion of production and consumption subsidies for all countries, available on an annual basis. The second element would be the use of this data, along with that of carbon pricing data (see Indicator 4.9), to create a since `net carbon price' indicator. The future practicality of this indicator will depend on the availability of data at the appropriate level of granularity.	1
The World Bank provides the data for this indicator, through the interactive `Carbon Pricing Dashboard'. x Prices for 2016 and 2017 are those as of 1st August 2016 and 1st April 2017, respectively. For 2017, the indicator includes only instruments that had been introduced by 1st April 2017. Baseline-and-credit systems are excluded from the analysis. GHG coverage data is presented as a proportion of 2012 global anthropogenic GHG emissions (53, 937 MTCO2e) as calculated by EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) xi. Monetary values are presented in US$, in current prices.	1

Instrument coverage of GHG emissions, in both absolute and proportional term, are based on total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2012 - the last year in which consistent data was available. `Baseline and Credit' instruments are not included due to a lack of price data. Some instruments experience an overlap in coverage. For example, the UK Carbon Price Floor applies to the power sector in the UK, which is also subject to carbon pricing under the EU ETS. Other instruments experience only partial overlap. As such, total emissions coverage is likely to be overestimated (ceteris paribus), although this effect is likely to be minor. The price used to calculate the weighted average prices are the prevailing prices on a single day. The prices for many instruments (particularly ETS instruments) are likely to alter of the course of a year, however the effect on the final value is likely to be minor. Prices are presented in current values. See Indicator 4.7. - Fossil Fuel Subsidies.	1
Working 4. Economics and Finance Group Indicator 4.8. Use of Carbon Pricing Revenues Methods Data on revenue generated is provided by the World Bank's interactive `Carbon Pricing Dashboard'.Error! Bookmark not defined. Data for the division into the four categories of revenue expenditure are provided largely by Carl and Fedor (2016), supplemented by external sources (as described below). The method of revenue expenditure classification is also adapted from Carl and Fedor (2016) xii. Definitions and assumptions regarding the categories as applied in this paper are as follows: Climate Change Mitigation - revenues are explicitly allocated to activities or infrastructure that seeks to reduce, or enable the reduction, of greenhouse gas emissions, from any source, within or outside of the sectors or jurisdiction in which the carbon price is applied. Climate Change Adaptation - as above, but for adaptation activities or infrastructure. Environmental Tax Reform (ETR) - revenues are explicitly returned to some broad 86	1
portion of the population through individual or business tax rate cuts, tax eliminations, or rebates in order to achieve broad revenue neutrality. Revenue returned to directly compensate for the cost of GHG emissions (through free permit allocation or targeted assistance for energy-intensive, trade-exposed firms) are not included). General Funds - revenues are explicitly used for purposes other than those described above, or the use of revenues is unspecified or information is unavailable. Only revenue that may be considered government income is included. For example, revenue generated by sale of permits issued to utilities under the Californian cap and trade instrument, which much then be used to finance discounts on household energy bills through `carbon credits', are not considered, as this revenue does not pass through the State government. Instruments for which price data is not available, either due to the type of instrument or simply lack of data, are not included. Other assumptions as applied to individual instruments are described below. Data Revenue (US$2016 million) Alberta SGER	1
measure adaptation in 2009/2010. The definition of adaptation activities was extended through collaboration with the Greater London Authority in 2014. In 2017, the definition of adaptation and resilience activities has been updated through a project with Climate-KIC, which has added several new industrial sectors as well as significantly expanding the activities under health and healthcare. The methodology used for data acquisition and analysis is based on a system called as `profiling', which was originally developed at Harvard Business School to track and analyse technical and industrial change. This is the basis for building taxonomies of economic activities and value chains, which can then be populated with estimates of key economic metrics like sales value and employment by triangulating transactional and operational business data to estimate economic values. This methodology is particularly valuable in areas where government statistics and standard industry classifications are not available. When measuring an industry or sector, the new taxonomy is populated from the bottom up, searching for evidence for the ideal definition and including only economic activities where sufficient evidence is available. For each transaction listed in the adaptation economy data, a minimum of seven separate sources must independently record the transaction for it to be confirmed and included in our database. Triangulating data from multiple sources permits large volumes of unsorted, fragmented data of different types from different sources to be processed to arrive at more accurate estimates of transactional value that would not be possible using a single source. For the adaptation economy, data are produced to a confidence level of around 80%. Accessing and analysing multiple types of data is also key to identifying the `purpose' behind an economic activity, which is key for accurately assigning economic activities to the adaptation dataset. Developing the new definition of adaptation and resilience to climate change involved the top-down taxonomy of the entire make and mend' economy, and then adaptation and resilience in all forms. Then these categories were filtered to isolate economic activities that can be strictly identified as being relevant to adaptation and resilience to climate change. The taxonomy of A&RCC is drawn from 11 sectors of the economy at-large: Agriculture & Forestry, Built Environment, Disaster-Preparedness, Energy, Health, ICT, Natural Environment, Professional Services, Transport, Waste and Water. From across the entire adaptation and resilience to climate change dataset, it was seen that there are a number of activities across different sectors that are `health-related', outside of the strictly-defined healthcare sector. Part of the design of the indicator therefore required the definition of those activities from the other 10 sectors of the A&RCC data that can be clearly related to health, and thus should be included in a definition of `health-related' adaptation spending. An initial exploration of the A&RCC dataset had yielded a `three-tier' approach for the categorization of health-related adaptation activities; 1) adaptation activities with direct, important health impacts, that clearly and directly protect health in substantial ways, or address major contributors to 89	1
burdens of disease 2) those with less direct or more minor health impacts, that indirectly benefit human health, or prevent minor impacts of burdens of disease 3) activities that primarily protect infrastructure and investment, those with no health impact or an impact on human health that is too circuitous or indirect. A robust interim approach was adopted for this year's Lancet Countdown. A 'health-related' definition of activities that would be assigned to `category 1' of the proposed categorisation was used, consisting the activities of the Healthcare/Health Sector, Disaster Preparedness and Agriculture adaptation activities from the kMatrix dataset. Although these may be revised in future research to define the full health-related adaptation definition, it was determined with a fairly high degree of certainty that there would be very little that is currently measured in these three sectors that would not be included the `most direct impacts' category of our categorisation. Further detail can be found in `Future Form of Indicator' on the future development of the indicator. A methodology is already under development to define a full health-related adaptation definition across the entire A&RCC dataset. Researchers from University College London, kMatrix and the University of Washington will collaborate on leading a consultation exercise on the creation of the full health-related adaptation definition in order to provide this as input to the next iteration of the Lancet Countdown. Comparison Data Population and nominal GDP data from 2015 and 2016 from the IMF's World Economic Outlook (April 2017) were used to estimate 2015/2016 Financial Year values for population and nominal GDP. Categorization of countries into the regions defined by the WHO's regional classification was conducted using metadata from the WHO. Geographical Coverage	1
The indicator has global coverage for 226 countries and territories. Data has not been reported for all 226 countries and territories as the accompanying comparison data is not available for all, therefore the data reports a subset of countries for whom adaptation spending data, GDP estimates and population estimates are available, which totals over 180 countries. Spending data was available for 226 countries and territories, but due to missing data (principally population and GDP data) for 46 of these, we report on 180 countries. Data Sources: Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change dataset: kMatrix Ltd, in partnership with University College London Population and nominal GDP data: IMF World Economic Outlook Data on national population and GDP for FY 2015-16 were taken from the 90	1
Regional classification: World Health Organization Due to the nature of the methodology, transactions are only measured where there is an economic `footprint', i.e. where there is transactional/financial data available to be measured. Therefore, public sector spending with economic `footprint' (government spending on salaries, for example), cannot be measured. It also not possible to directly identify what percentage of measured spending is public versus private. Values are not currently adjusted for inflation. Values of sales generated are not directly comparable with values derived from national statistics. The reference period is financial year 2015/16 (including annual growth in %). Unfortunately, it was not possible to process all of the historical data to provide trend data back to 2010/11 in time for the 2017 report deadline, but it is highly likely that this will be available in the future. This is, however, partly because significant effort was devoted to extended and updating the definitions of adaptation activities, which should make for a more comprehensive dataset (20% of the value in the new dataset represents new activities, so it is a significant step change). The `health-related adaptation' measure is based on Health, Agriculture and Disaster Preparedness for this year's report, but in future years it will also include health activities from a wider spread of the economy, as well as have another `tier' of measurement.	1
Given differences in data collection methods between transactional triangulation and GDP, comparisons as a percentage of GDP should be treated as indicative. GDP (nominal) data was used and transactional data, in this case, has not been adjusted for differences in purchasing power parity, and this should be considered when consulting the data. There will be three major developments in the future form of the indicator. The first will be the development of the `three-tier' definition of; 1) adaptation activities with direct, important health impacts 2) those with less direct or more minor health impacts 3) those with no health impact or too tenuous a health impact. Further details of how this will be developed are available in the `Methods' section of this appendix. Secondly, in the future it will possible to present historical data for the indicator (back to 2010/2011), in order to provide trend data on change in spend over time. It would also be ideal to provide a comparison of health sector and healthrelated adaptation spend as a percentage of overall transactional spend in the health sector. As noted above, in future reports it should be possible to include historical trend data, along with an annual update to the latest available data. It 91	1
may also be possible within this time frame (2018+), depending on funding, to develop the full health sector model for measurement as previously discussed. Finally, in future iterations, it will be possible to provide an indicator of adaptation spending as a percentage of the overall health sector spend and health-related spend as a percentage of the entire economy (represented by 24 industries), compiled using transactional data. This should be available within the next few years. Supplementary Information	1
4. Economics and Finance 4.10 Health adaptation funding from global climate financing mechanisms This indicator used the Climate Funds Update (CFU  20data on total gross flows of all multilaterally governed funds focused on climate change since 2003. The data also includes funds from bilateral organisations, but excludes funding from bilateral to multinational organisations, to avoid double counting of funds. For this indicator, the CFU data selected was for adaptation only and the "approved funding" figure was used to calculate adaptation funding. To calculate the adaptation funding that has been allocated to health, the following sectors were selected: "basic health", "health" and "health, general". Although it is recognised that other adaptation measures can have important health co-benefits, drawing out how effectively adaptation projects benefitted and accounted for health is complex and developing a consistent methodology for doing so would require more resource. Therefore, only those projects earmarked specifically as health were included in the analysis here. Climate Funds Update Some of the data was incomplete and so those adaptation projects that did not have the year noted could not be included, as it would then not be possible to accurately show the annual funding for adaptation and health adaptation, or changes in funding over time. To counter this, project documents were searched for and, where available, the project approval date updated in the CFU data. However, this was not possible for all projects. Furthermore, these results show funding through global climate financing mechanisms only and do not show the additional funding support given to these adaptation projects (for example, from UN agencies or national governments). The funding mechanisms included in the CFU data are shown in Web Table 1. Climate funding from Canada, the US, Japan and Denmark is not included in the CFU data; as such the figures presented here are likely to be underestimates. Additionally, the data presented in Figure 1 is not cumulative. Although most projects run for more than one year, there was insufficient information in the CFU data detailing the allocated spending for each project year and so only the total approved adaptation funding in each given year was shown. In future, this indicator could show all funding streams that fund adaptation generally and health adaptation specifically. The contributions of different funding streams could then be analysed and new funding streams (such as national governments) shown.	1
5. Public and Political Engagement 5.1. Media coverage of health and climate change 5.1.1. Global newspaper reporting on health and climate change In this portion of the project, we identify intersecting trends in coverage in eighteen selected sources across six regions - Asia, Oceania, North America, South America, Middle East, and Europe - between climate change and health from January 2007 through December 2016. We assemble the data by accessing archives through the Lexis Nexis, Proquest and Factiva databases via the University of Colorado libraries. These sources are selected through a decision processes involving weighting of four main factors: (1) geographical diversity (favouring a greater geographical range), (2) circulation (favouring higher circulating publications), (3) national sources (rather than local/regional), and (4) reliable access to archives over time (favouring those accessible consistently for longer periods). The following Boolean searches in English and Spanish, respectively, were used: * malaria or diarrhoea or infection or disease or sars or measles or 94	1
pneumonia or epidemic or pandemic or public health or healthcare or epidemiology or health care or health or mortality or morbidity or nutrition or illness or infectious or NCD or non-communicable disease or communicable disease or air pollution or nutrition or malnutrition or mental disorder or stunting AND climate change or global warming or green house or temperature or extreme weather or global environmental change or climate variability or greenhouse or low carbon or ghge or renewable energy or carbon emissions or co2 emissions or climate pollutants * malaria or diarrea or infeccion or enfermedad or sars or sarampion or neumonia or epidemia or pandemia or salud publica or salud or epidemiologia or salud or salud or mortalidad or morbilidad or nutricion or enfermedad or enfermedad infecciosa or NCD or no transmisible or enfermedad contagiosa or transmisible or contaminacion del aire or nutricion or desnutricion or trastorno mental or retraso del crecimiento AND cambio climatico or calentamiento global or temperatura or clima extremo or cambio ambiental global or variabilidad climatica or invernadero or bajo carbono or ghge or energia renovable or emisiones de carbono or emisiones de CO2 or contaminantes climaticos * ASIA: Times of India (India), Hindustan Times (India), Jakarta Post (Indonesia), Manila Bulletin (Philippines), Philippine Daily Inquirer (Philippines), Straits Times (Malaysia) * MIDDLE EAST: Daily Star (Lebanon) * EUROPE: El Pais (Spain), Daily Mail/Mail on Sunday (UK), The Sun (UK) * SOUTH AMERICA: El Nacional (Venezuela) * NORTH AMERICA: Toronto Star (Canada), Globe and Mail (Canada), USA Today (USA), Wall Street Journal (USA) * OCEANIA: The Australian (Australia), Dominion Post (New Zealand), Sydney Morning Herald (Australia) There are some cautions with these findings. With this extensive Boolean string, there may be some returns that do not centrally address climate change and health together. For example, the search term "temperature" often generates a hit, but articles may be addressing a fever related to some illness, rather than climate change or global warming. As another example, there may be some overlap between articles discussing climate change legislation and health care legislation without meaningfully linking climate change and health. Also, in working with newspapers, rather than, for example, UN communications/documents, a narrower or more tailored approach might more effectively reduce the possibilities for false positives in the dataset. However, for consistency with the other groups and collaborators in the Lancet Countdown project, we have agreed to carry out the searches with the established terms above and we therefore are committed to the search results and trends generated. In future, more newspaper will be included in the analysis, with improved representation of different regions. Further details on how health and climate change is reported on will also be sought, including the demonstration of how marginal health is to the wider coverage of/debates about climate change. There will also be an effort to match the newspaper included in 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 to allow for better comparison and analysis of newspaper reporting on health and climate change.	1
5. Public and Political Engagement 5.1. Media coverage of health and climate change 5.1.2. In-depth analysis of newspaper coverage on health and climate change The analysis used online databases, holding both printed and online versions of Le Monde and FAZ, and was conducted in two stages. Potential articles related to health and climate change were captured through an initial search, a more detailed keyword search within each text then identified articles linking health and climate change. This second stage also collected information on the framing of health and climate change (for instance, as an environmental or economic issue), potential policy responses and co-benefits. The tracking analysis relied on a consistent set of search terms for the two newspapers, but this may have introduced a linguistic bias. Furthermore, only two newspapers were analysed, so the findings cannot be used to indicate the broader nature of newspaper coverage on health and climate change. The methodology of our analysis is based on and has been developed by the 4CHealth research group, set up by the Centre Virchow-Villerme in Paris and Berlin, to analyse how the health-climate nexus was addressed in the media. We used a 96	1
detailed strategy to search the online database of the French newspaper Le Monde and the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied in order to capture the most relevant literature in the timeframe chosen. The search was conducted in two stages, the first one with broad term aiming to capture most articles on the subject. The second stage consisted in a keyword search within text to collect only the articles linking climate change and health. To filter the valuable articles in the online data bases we have a two-stage-process. In the first step, we have applied a quantitative approach by choosing keywords which would specify the topic "climate change and health" in order to exclude the unrelated articles. Therefore we looked for the most obvious keywords "climate change" and "health" and climate-change-related as well as health-related keywords. These keywords have been deductively defined, meaning, while reading the articles we have noticed the reoccurrence of particular climate-change-related or healthrelated terms, which have then been added to our keyword group. In practice we have searched for the following keywords in Le Monde and the FAZ (see Table 1).	1
Table 1 : Keywords and Boolean operator ; stage 1 ; stage 2 As the Table indicates, the first stage keyword search for the FAZ was more elaborated than the one for Le Monde. This was due to the fact that the online data base of the FAZ showed only a small number of articles that included "health" as a health-related term. By adding more health-related keywords to the list, it allowed us to have a greater total number of relevant articles to progress to the secondstage-process. Articles were only accepted for the second-stage-process if they included a health-related and a climate-change-related term. For the second stage of the analysis, a qualitative screening of the articles was undertaken to categorize them according to a predefined grid. -	1
Context: This category distinguishes whether the article was about an international summit (COP, G8, etc.), the publication of a study/scientific report (IPCC, lancet commission) or an extreme weather event (flooding, heat waves). Recommendations: we identified whether the dominant recommendation (if there was one) was about mitigation, adaptation, or co-benefits. Tone: we have categorized the tone of the article into four classes: neutral, positive, mixed and negative.	1
Newspaper articles on health and climate change in Le Monde and FAZ (2007-2016). Context and content of publications addressing the climate-health nexus The context was often related to international events such as climate conferences or scientific discoveries (see table below). Health crises seldom led to articles pointing out the role of climate change.	1
Articles mentioning health impacts were a small proportion of the total of articles about climate change: out of 4031 articles about climate change in Le Monde, only 168 mentioned a link between climate change and health. The share was even smaller in FAZ: 67 articles mention the linkages between climate change and health of 5757. The climate-health nexus is addressed purely as an environmental issue in France, while it is more likely to be treated as an economic and/or social issue in Germany (see box below).	1
Le Monde : Planete (Earth) (70%), Idees (Ideas) (16%), Economie (Economy) (6,5%), A la Une (Front-page news) (2,5%), Vous ( Opinion ) (1,5) International (International), Sante (Health), Science (Science), Societe (Society), Culture (Culture), Sport (Sport), Techno (Innovation) (0,5%). FAZ. : Wirtschaft (Economy) (23%), Rhein-Main Zeitung (Local news) (20 %), Politik (Politics) (17%), Natur-und-Wissenshaft (Natural sciences) (15%), FAZ.net (Online news) (15%), Feuilleton (Culture) (6%), Verlagsbeilage (Print Supplement), Sonntagszeitung (Week end edition) (4%). Another difference between Le Monde and FAZ was the solutions that were recommended to address the health impacts of climate change: while Le Monde focused on the adaptation strategies to deploy, FAZ put more emphasis on the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The co-benefits that public health policies can represent for mitigation, however, are barely mentioned in either of the papers. The table below summarises the share of articles where the dominant recommendation was about mitigation, adaptation, or co-benefits.	1
The databases are online databases from Le Monde and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. We used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods (see methods above). Articles were searched in the online search databases using specific search syntax. Articles were then screened, identified and categorised according to specified criteria (type of article, studied health impact, geographical focus, etc). This analysis considers only a narrow range of search terms, which can induce a strong linguistic bias. French articles addressing health will almost always mention the term `sante' (`health' in French), whereas the German equivalent `Gesundheit' is less often mentioned in articles addressing public health. In order to provide a similar basis for comparison, we had to use the same protocol to analyse articles in both Le Monde and FAZ, but we need to be aware that some terms (`health' in particular) were more frequently used in a language than in the other. In the future, we aim to compare and contrast our analysis of coverage in Le Monde and FAZ with other newspapers, such as The Guardian or The New York Times, in order to account for perspectives of other older industrialised countries, and with newspapers from developing countries, where the health impacts of climate change are most marked. Our longer- term goal is a series of international newspapers analyses. The analysis will include both the global North and the global South.	1
5. Public and Political Engagement 5.2. Health and climate change in scientific journals We tracked the use of climate-related terms and their co-occurrence with health terms using a bibliometric search in both PubMed and Web of Science databases. The search terms were the following and adapted according to the database: Climate change related terms Health related terms Climate Change Health Global warming Disease Climate variability - Non-Communicable Greenhouse effect - NCD GHGE - Communicable Epidemiology Lifestyle Co-Benefits Mortality Morbidity Nutrition Malnutrition Dehydration Migration Mental disorders This list of search terms were found to be exhaustive and appropriate for scientific databases. A more detailed search syntax, including the diseases of poverty used by indicator 5.3 was not necessary as with the use of medical subject headings (MeSHTerms) for instance in PubMed those diseases are covered through the MeSH Term "Communicable diseases". Different search syntaxes were applied and the final number of overall publications did not show to vary significantly underlining that the search strategy was robust and able to capture most relevant articles. Titles and abstracts of identified papers for relevance to the topic were screened three times. The results were then merged using the Endnote reference manager software and duplicates removed. Conflicts were resolved within the research team and a final selection of articles was prepared for analysis. The stepwise process of the selection of articles is presented in the flow chart below.	1
Numbers indicate the article count retained at each step of the process. With the applied search terms more than 8000 scientific articles on climate change and health were identified for the period of 2007-2016. After the screening process only 4% (27 of 2282) were retained and found to be relevant. Indeed, a majority just mentioned climate change in the abstract and did not focus on the link between climate change and health. Other articles explored ecological health or animal health but not human health and were therefore excluded. A minority of papers were excluded as these were book chapters or conference proceedings referenced in both databases. After the screening process, data were extracted, categorized and coded to allow for statistical analysis of the results. Geographically, the majority of publications address the impact of climate change and health in Europe and the Americas (Figure S5.1 below). This is particularly concerning given that countries in the Global South will bear the greatest health burden.	1
Figure S5.2 shows the distribution of publications on health and climate change by the location of the study (using WHO world regions). For almost all regions, a first peak of scientific publications is observed in 2008-2009. While some regions showed a subsequent decline in publications (in 2010-2011), this was not a global trend (the number of studies focussed on South-East Asia as well as on the Western Pacific Region was on the rise). Big trends or peaks for regions such as Africa or Eastern Mediterranean region could not be observed due to their low publication volume. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied in order to capture the most relevant literature. Only peer-reviewed scientific articles on climate change and population health in English were included. This means that all articles including original quantitative and qualitative studies, reviews, editorials, viewpoints or comments are covered in this indicator. Also, no restriction with respect to country or population was applied. Through the screening process, articles that mentioned climate-related or health-related terms in titles or abstracts but did not have a specific focus on, or direct link between, climate change and health were excluded. This indicator only used two databases, which may be a limitation. However, both databases are complementary and cover together the majority of the scientific publications in the area of climate change and human health. Grey literature is not captured in the indicator and may bias the results. Also the restriction to publications in English language only may be a caveat. Finally, the quality of identified scientific publications was not assessed, and analysis was conducted using the title and abstract of articles due to the restrictions in locating full texts for the large volume of articles included. With respect to caveats, the trends identified in scientific engagement (Figure 5.2) may be influenced by the search terms used in the review. As far as possible, used common search terms were used across the three indicators in this chapter, enabling comparisons to be drawn across engagement in health and climate change in the media, the scientific community and in the political sphere. Furthermore, the review was restricted to English-language journals. Other caveats for this indicator include the narrow range of search terms, which excludes reference to many of indirect links between health and climate change. Several 105	1
UNGD statements in the dataset refer to such indirect connections, such as effects of climate change on water and agriculture, but these are not included. Therefore, the results present a conservative estimate of high-level political engagement with the intersecting issues of health and climate change. Future Lancet Countdown reports will consider political engagement with these indirect links, as well as providing additional forms of analysis. For the regional analysis (Figure 5.4), note should be taken of variation in the number of countries per region. The indicator aims to provide an overview of existing scientific publications in the area of climate change and health. For the 2017 report, it provides an overview of trends across the last decade. Going forward, it will monitor future trends. The search syntax can be used each year to track the number of scientific articles on climate change and health. In the future, each identified scientific publication will be categorized according to different criteria (geographical focus, type of article, health outcome, type of climate change measurement, etc.) in order to provide a more in depth analysis of research trends and foci. Other dimensions, such as the country location and institutional affiliation of authors, cross-country collaboration and citations could also be analysed.	1
5. Public and Political Engagement 5.3. Health and climate change in the United Nations General Assembly The dataset on UNGD statements used contains all country speeches made in the UNGD between 1970 and 2016. Here, the frequency of references to health and climate change in annual UNGD statements was considered between 2007 and 2016. Overall, 1,928 high level statements were examined. The keywords used are based on a) health-related terms and b) climate change-related terms. The search terms for (a) heath are: "malaria", "diarrhoea", "infection", "disease", "pneumonia", "epidemic", "pandemic", "public_health", "health_care", "epidemiology", "healthcare", "health", "mortality", "morbidity", "nutrition", "illness", "infectious", "ncd", "non-communicable_disease", "noncommunicable_disease", "communicable_disease", "air_pollution", "nutrition", "malnutrition", "mental_disorder", "stunting".	1
change and health, we focused on whether any of the health related terms appeared immediately before or after any climate change terms in the GD statements. This was based on a search of the 10 words before and after a reference to a climate change related term. Data	1
To produce this indicator, we draw on a new dataset of GD statements: the United Nations General Debate corpus, in which the annual GD statements have been preprocessed and prepared for use in quantitative text analysis. 4 The dataset contains all of the country speeches made in the UN General Debate between 1970 and 2016.	1
This analysis here is based on a narrow range of search terms, which excludes reference to many of indirect links between climate change and health. A number of GD statements in this time period refer to such indirect connections, such as the effects of climate change on water and agriculture - however, these are not included here. Therefore, the results present a somewhat conservative estimate of high level political engagement with the intersection of climate change and health. Future work in this area will consider engagement with these indirect links, as well as providing additional forms of analysis.	1
In the future, we plan on looking more closely at the references to indirect links between climate change and health. For example, what are the main ways in which governments view climate change impacting on health? We will consider whether this changes over time based on awareness of the multiple ways in which climate change and health are connected. We will also look to expand this indicator by considering private sector engagement with climate change and health. Specifically, for next iteration of the indicator we will examine annual corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports ("Triple Bottom Line Reports") of major international corporations. Using these report, we will perform similar searches (engagement with health, climate change, and intersection of the two) based on these reports.	1
We present some additional findings and breakdowns in this section. Figure S5.3 below shows the level of political engagement with climate change and health separately, rather than engagement with the intersection of climate change and health. Again, this is measured by the references to the key search terms associated with climate change and health in General Debate speeches. The figure shows that in general there is a higher level of engagement with climate change than health. It also shows a decline in engagement with climate change in the General Debate following COP 15 in Copenhagen in 2009. However, in recent years this has increased around the Paris Agreement. Engagement with health has generally been quite low in the General Debate. However, there is a large increase in the salience of global health from 2012 onwards, which coincides with the transition from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the Sustainable	1

Figure S5.4 above displays a word cloud of terms linked to the intersection of climate change and health. In other words, it shows the main topics that are raised in GD statements (2007-2016) when governments discuss the linkages between climate change and health. The figure shows that in addition to topics that are directly linked to climate change and health, issues such as food, global disasters, poverty, and security are also referred to. The word cloud also shows that Copenhagen and Paris were key issues raised in the discussions of the intersection of climate change and health between 2007 and 2016. Figure S5.5 below displays a word cloud for health. In other words, it shows the topics that governments refer to in General Debate statements when discussing health. It is important to note that climate change features as a prominent topic. Therefore, this suggests that when discussing health in the General Debate, governments tend to emphasise the role of climate change. Figure S5.5	1
There references to the linkages between climate change and health in the GD statements tend to vary considerably. For example, Denmark's address in 2014 made a more general reference to "...climate change causing great risks to human health, global food security and economic development..." Other statements focus on more specific linkages. For example, Angola's statement in 2016 highlights the importance of the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and links greenhouse gas emissions and climate change to "...the deterioration and shortening of cycles of drought and heavy rainfall, which pose a risk to agriculture...", and goes on to state that "...such effects also increase the incidence of various epidemic diseases".	1
Public and political engagement Engagement with health and climate change in corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports In order to produce a measure of corporate engagement with the intersection of climate change and health using corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability reports of major public international companies. We will focus on whether any key health related terms appeared immediately before or after any key climate change terms in the CSR and sustainability reports. This is based on a search of the 10 words before and after a reference to a climate change related term. To produce this indicator, we will collect the CSR and sustainability reports that cover economic, environmental, social, and governance performance of major public international companies. These reports are designed to show internal and external stakeholders organisational commitment to sustainable development. As a primary data source we will focus on the collection of reports available through the United Nations Global Compact. 5 Corporations that sign up to the UN Global Compact have to report annually on their progress on the various principles of the Global Compact, which include a strong focus on environmental and social responsibility. The aim of these reports is to create greater accountability by enabling stakeholders to judge the performance of corporations that have signed up. Therefore, these reports provide an important source of information on how corporations on the extent to which corporations engage with the linkages between climate change and health. Furthermore, these reports are comparable across corporations from a wide range of developed and developing countries, as well as from different sectors. 6 The degree of data coverage is unclear and likely to be slightly uneven given voluntary nature of producing such reports and making them publicly available. Public and political engagement Inclusion of health and climate change within medical and public health curricula Health professionals have a key role in promoting climate change and health to the public and politics. As a trusted and respected knowledge source, health professionals can advocate these issues to their patients and help building community resilience (1, 2). They can use their unique health expertise and community understanding to effectively influence environmental policy (1, 3, 4). The WHO Second Global Conference Health & Climate thus called for health professionals to take on a role of leadership and advocacy on these	1
Information regarding the UN Global Compact together with the CSR and sustainability reports are available here:  [accessed 2 June 2017]. 6 Rasche, A. (2009) `Toward a Model to Compare and Analyze Accountability Standards - the Case of the UN Global Compact', Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 16(4): 192-205. 112	1
Yet, several studies report that they are impeded by a lack of education on these topics (5, 6). The inclusion of health & climate change in health professionals training is therefore essential. This proposed indicator will aim at describing the state of health & climate change education within medical and public health curricula. The scope of the proposed indicator is limited to medical education before specialization, and to master degree programs of public, global, or international health. The data are collected through a survey questionnaire, informed by a literature review and advice from selected experts. The questions concern the inclusion of courses on climate change, their design and their integration in the curriculum. The results are analysed using descriptive statistics. The analysis will include a regional comparison using the WHO region grouping. The survey used to collect data was sent to the member institutions of three international networks: the M8 alliance, the World Federation of Academic Institutions for Global Health (WFAIGH) and the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME). Responses from 11 public health master degree programs and 25 medical schools are already available. * The already available responses may not be representative of the global state of climate change and health education worldwide: they represent a small number of programs, from 4 of the 6 WHO regions, and several from the same country. * The proposed indicator is limited to medical schools and public / global / international health masters. Ideally, it should reflect the climate change & health education of all health professionals. * Given the slow rate to which curricula change, it may not be relevant to update this proposed indicator each year. 1.

1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.1 Vulnerability to the health-risks of climate change This indicator displays an index derived by taking mean of proportion of the population over 65 years (1)2; the prevalence of cardiovascular, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases among population over 65years GBD 2016 estimates (2)3 and the proportion of the population living in urban areas (3)4 as a measure of exposure to urban heat island. The index ranges between 0 and 100 and is a measure of potential vulnerability of a country to heat exposure. We display aggregated trends by WHO regional classifications for the period 1990 to 2016. 1. Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network.

This indicator may readily be updated with new data each year. Additionally, it would be interesting to project it further into the past to obtain a longer term overview of the progression of this indicator. 1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.3 Health effects of heatwaves A heatwave was defined as a period of 4 or more days at a given location where the minimum daily temperature was greater than the 99th percentile of the distribution of minimum daily temperature at that location over the 1986-2005 reference period, for the summer months. The number and length of heatwaves was calculated for 1986-2017 over the weather grid. The mean number and length was calculated for 1986-2005. The summer months for each hemisphere were selected as in 1.1. The change in number and length of heatwaves was then calculated for each year from 2000 to 2016 for each location and the global area weighted means calculated for each year. Yearly population grids were used as described in 1.1 The population over 65 count was calculated by matching demographic data the fraction of people over 65 for each year from the UN WPP with country area definitions, and projecting this onto the population grid. This effectively assumed that over 65 fraction is constant across a given country's area. The number and length of heatwaves grid was projected onto the population over 65. A population weighted mean length was calculated and a number of exposures (heatwaves x persons) were calculated for each year.	1
Mean daily WBGT (WBGTmean) and daily maximum (WBGTmax) are calculated as the mean and maximum of 6 hourly values. WBGThalf is calculated as the midpoint between WBGTmean and WBGTmax. The change in WBGT relative to the 1986-2005 reference period demonstrates a strong trend of increasing WBGT mean globally over the past decades. This change is calculated by averaging the daily mean WBGT for each location for each day of the year for the period 1986-2005. Then for each day in the WBGT time series, the value from the corresponding day from the average of the reference period is subtracted from the WBGT value for that day. Finally, the global mean for each year is calculated taking into account the relative areas of the grid cells. Adjusted labour loss fractions are calculated for each grid cell for WBGTmean, WBGTmax, and WBGThalf, using the equation above. Labour loss hours per person for each day in each cell are calculated for the 3 power levels by assuming 4 hours of labour at each WBGT temperature level: Loss hours per person = 4 * Loss fraction at WBGTmean + 4* Loss fraction at WBGTmax + 4* Loss fraction at WBGThalf (Kjellstrom, Freyberg, Lemke, Otto, & Briggs, 2017) Yearly total hours lost are calculated as the sum of the daily hours lost. These are mapped below for 2000 and 2017 for each power level to illustrate the change in hours lost per person per power level per year over time. People working in agriculture are assigned a 400W work rate, industry a 300W work rate and services a 200W work rate to determine hours lost per person in each sector. Then, for each country, the working age population (15+ years from UN demographic data) and the proportion of people working in the 3 sectors (agriculture, industry and services from ILO supplied data) are assigned to the grid cells occupied by that country. The total yearly hours lost for each sector and in total is calculated by summing over all grid locations for each year (excluding areas of water and permanent ice). The yearly values in billions of hours lost are given below.	1
National Drought Mitigation Centre (US) Meteorological drought relates to precipitation deficits, not considering water reserves in the ground, lakes, etc. Although meteorological drought is somewhat removed from the economic, social, and environmental impacts that are of interest in the context of human health, it is a necessary precursor to these effects and is therefore an important measure of risk. Furthermore, readily available climate data allows the calculation of global meteorological drought trends through the definition of drought indices. In 2009, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) approved the Lincoln Declaration on Drought Indices (LDDI). The LDDI recommends that "the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) be used to characterize the meteorological droughts around the world". The SPI is calculated by fitting a gamma distribution to historical monthly precipitation data and standardising this to a normal distribution. The resulting values give indicators of precipitation levels above or below historical trends. The SPI can additionally be performed using sliding sums of monthly precipitation, for example to 3, 6, or 12 months (denoted as SPI3, SPI6, SPI12 respectively). This allows to take into consideration effects at different time scales, such as seasonal effects.	1
Drought exposure indicator definition The SPI can be calculated on the basis of the rolling sum of one or more months, for each month the SPI value is calculated using the sum of precipitation for n preceding months, denoted as SPI-n. SPI-6 (6 monthly rolling sum) was used for this indicator, allowing the identification of annual-scale drought risks. The global area in extreme drought was calculated by summing the areas of regions where SPI-6 is less than -1.5. Exposures of drought were measured as person-months in drought - one exposure event being one person exposed to one month in drought. Populations were not distinguished by vulnerability (for instance, according to demographics or socioeconomic status). The yearly drought indicator is defined for a given location as the sum of the number of months in extreme drought (SPI < -1.64). This is presented for illustrative purposes at the total area in drought. The drought exposure indicator for a given year at a given location is the number of people at that location times the total number of months in severe drought, in units of `person-months in drought'. The global total number of person-months in drought is calculated as the sum over all locations. Meteorological drought (defined in terms of a rainfall deficit relative to historical norms for a region is a necessary precursor to agricultural drought (soil water deficiency) and hydrological drought (reduced stream flow and water stocks))	1
return level and ending when it dropped below this value. The rolling sum of precipitation was calculated for each day as the sum of the preceding 5 days total precipitation (in mm). The precipitation value corresponding to the 10 year return period was calculated using the method described in 1. The time series of precipitations ppt was sorted in order of magnitude. Each precipitation value was assigned a rank equal to its position in the sorted list. The probability of exceedance for a given rank was calculating according to the Gringorten (WMO, 1983) formula.  =	1
Where N is the number of data points. The baseline precipitation threshold was calculated by applying this method to daily total precipitation derived from ERAInterim for the period 1986-2005. The number of extreme rainfall events per year in the period 2000 to present was calculated by counting the number of periods for each grid cell where the precipitation exceeded the baseline precipitation threshold, using the daily total precipitation derived from ERA-Interim. The number of exposure events was calculated by multiplying the number of people at each location by the number of extreme rainfall events at that location. Population data was derived from the NASA GWPv42.	1
1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.6 Lethality of weather-related disasters This indicator is based on the generic formulation from a climate change perspective of disasters as a function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Year to year variation was measured, showing the number of people killed as a proportion of those affected by different hazard type, normalised by the strength of the individual hazards as a measure of adaptive (or maladaptive) changes in national health care services and the associated disaster preparedness and response. Here, deaths are defined as the number of people who lost their life because the disaster happened, and people affected as those requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency; hence requiring basic survival needs such as food, water, shelter, sanitation and immediate medical assistance.	1
In 2018, the data has been presented as standardized anomalies, representing the difference between the variable that year and average of the variable from 19902009, normalized by the standard deviation of the variable over the same period. Only statistically significant (at 0.05 significance level) linear trends over time are shown. EM-DAT at the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) at the Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium ( One underlying assumption is that the normalised number of people killed by climate related disasters is an accurate proxy for measuring health impacts of the climate. Clearly this measure ignores the longer causal chains involving the interaction of climate and health. Finally, a further limitation is that this measure ignores the longer causal chains involving the interactions of weather, climate, disasters, health and health services	1
Future efforts will include a comparison of estimates of those exposed with those affected. Additionally, the impact of replacing the number of people killed with the number requiring assistance will also be explored. A subsidiary indicator will come from the online Sendai Framework Monitor. Here countries will start reporting against the Sendai Framework indicators and the DRR related indicators of the SDGs. The first Sendai Framework and SDG progress report will be released in 20191. This indicator therefore aims to expand to include country specific progress in vulnerability levels of health service systems to climate risks in relation to this monitoring data.	1

Changes in the standardized anomalies of the occurrences of disasters associated with droughts, floods, wildfires, extreme temperatures and storms from 1990-2017; where standardized anomalies (seasonal variations) represent the difference between the variable that year and the average of the variable from 1990-2009, normalized by the standard deviation of the variable over the same period. Statistically significant upward linear trends over time are shown for disasters associated with extreme temperatures and floods (at 0.05 significance level).	1
1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.7 Global health trends in climate-sensitive diseases This indicator displays generally unprocessed descriptive trends for selected diseases retrieved from The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project database (1) over the period 1990-2016. The derivation of estimates within the GBD study relies on modelling, rather than analysing direct observations, and the GBD methodology has already been described (1). The trends are aggregated and presented by WHO region as mortality rates per 100,000 individuals per year over the period. We provide also annual estimates by country in the supplement. As far as we can ascertain from the GBD documentation, climate change and weather are not part of the covariates included in the estimates, making it valid to examine GBD outputs in the light of climate and weather data to formulate coherent inter-country comparisons. Trends are described for: all causes of death, malaria, dengue, diarrhoeal diseases, proteinenergy malnutrition, heat and cold exposure, malignant melanoma and forces of nature.	1
Deaths directly related to forces of nature have been adjusted for the effects of the most severe seismic events and related tsunamis. Years with events reported to have caused a substantial death toll from 1990 to 2016 where discounted by replacing with the same countries' force of nature mortality for the previous year. 1. Global Burden of Disease Study 2016. Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016) Results. Seattle, United States: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), 2017. Available from  tool. This is not a direct measure of the impact of climate change on death and disease. Rather, it presents mortality figures for those diseases which are none to be influenced by climate. The trends presented therefore do not show detection and attribution of climate change to death. They do show the impact of climate relevant and climate sensitive diseases on mortality rates globally since 1990. GBD estimates are now revised annually. Future versions of this indicator may include additional health conditions, may include morbidity as well as mortality, and may extend to national and subnational scales. Increased interest in geo-spatial disease analyses is likely to lead to additional information, such as fringe zone trends and outbreaks, and associate patterns of diseases to climate anomalies, such as those driven by the ENSO circulation. Future disease trends in the GBD estimates will be linked to direct measurements in resource poor areas in Africa and Asia, for example using longitudinal mortality registers from the INDEPTH network.1 1.

1. Health Impacts of Climate Change 1.8 Climate-sensitive infectious diseases Dengue Context: Cases of dengue have doubled every decade since 1990, with 584 million (236 million-1219 million) apparent cases in 2013, accounting for over 10,000 deaths and 114 million (073 million-198 million) disability-adjusted life-years.26 Beside global mobility, climate change has been suggested as one potential contributor to this increase in burden.27 Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, the principal vectors of dengue, also carry other important emerging or reemerging arboviruses, including yellow fever, chikungunya, Mayaro and Zika viruses, and are likely to be similarly responsive to climate change. Methods: Methods for calculating vectorial capacity (VC) follow Liu-Helmersson et al. (2014) and LiuHelmersson et al. (2016). VC refers to a vector's ability to transmit disease to humans. It incorporates interactions between host, virus, and vector, assuming that all three of these elements are present. Specifically, VC represents the average daily number of secondary cases generated by one primary case introduced into a fully susceptible population, and is expressed as:	1
a is the average vector biting rate, bh is the probability of vector to human transmission per bite, bm is the probability of human to vector infection per bite, n is the duration of the extrinsic incubation period - EIP, m is the vector mortality rate, and m is the female vector-to-human population ratio. In our application, the time unit is 1 day and each of the vector parameters depends on temperature, with parameter values derived from the literature, typically from experimental data, as described in Liu-Helmersson et al., (2014). Diurnal temperature range (DTR) was reconstructed using a representative daily temperature through a piece-wise sinusoidal function based on the monthly average of daily minimum, maximum, and mean observations. Historical trends were derived by backcasting the models on data from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) online database, time series (CRU-TS 3.22) of gridded (0.5 x 0.5 degrees) monthly averages of daily temperature observations (minimums, maximum, and mean) for the time period 1950-2016. Future projections were derived using climate data under two greenhouse gas emission pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) (Weyant et al., 2009), representing the contrast between very strong mitigation action vs business-as-usual given consequent radiative forcing of greenhouse gases in the year 2100 (+2.6 and +8.5 W m-2, respectively), based on CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2011, Warszawski et al., 2014) atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. For each emission pathway, CMIP5 temperature datasets (min, max, mean resolution 0.5 x 0.5) were used. Calculations from each of the five global models (NorESM1-M, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, IPSL-CM5ALR, HadGEM2-ES and GFDL-ESM2M) were averaged to derive a multi-model mean (ensemble). We extracted the annual average VC values per grid cell to Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus presence points provided in Kraemer et al., (2015) and averaged these values by country to get country-specific trends in VC at monthly (seasonality analysis) or yearly time steps from 19502016 for each species. `Global vectorial capacity' indicates globally averaged values across all countries. Historical percentage change figures reported in the main text were calculated relative to a 1950s baseline (5 year average, 1950-54), either an average for the 2010s (5 year average, 20122016) to illustrate the overall trend accounting for interannual variability or for the most recent year for which data were available (2016). Projected percentage changes in VC for each vector in 2030 (taken from 5yr average 2028-2032) was calculated relative to a present baseline (5 yr average 2012-2016).	1
Vibrio Context Vibrio spp. are globally distributed aquatic bacteria that are ubiquitous in warm estuarine and coastal waters with low to moderate salinity. V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus and nontoxigenic V. cholerae (non-O1/non-O139) are pathogenic in humans. They are associated with sporadic cases of gastroenteritis, wound infections, ear infections or septicaemia, although they have not been not responsible for widespread epidemics in the past. Vibrio ecology, abundance, distributions and patterns of infection are often strongly mediated by environmental conditions. Water temperature, salinity and turbidity predict the distribution and abundance of V. vulnificus in Chesapeake Bay, with the number of infections increasing as a result of recent local warming and changes in rainfall (28). Increased water temperatures also explain outbreaks of Vibrio infections in countries bordering the Baltic Sea (22) and range expansions in Alaska (29).	1
This indicator focuses on mapping environmental suitability for pathogenic Vibrio spp. in coastal zones globally (<30km from coast). Methods: The indicator uses thresholds of >18C for Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and <30 PSU for Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). These values were derived on the basis of a consensus in the literature (Muhling et al., 2017; United States Food and Drug Administration, 2005; Parveen et al., 2008; Martinez-Urtaza et al., 2008). Estimates for SST were obtained from NOAA Optimum Interpolation 1/4 Degree Daily Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) Analysis, Version 2 for the period 1982-2017. This dataset is provided by the NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD, Boulder, Colorado, USA, accessible from  . The salinity fields were created from daily data obtained from Mercator Ocean Reanalysis, ( Here we report suitability at two levels. First, we calculated the percentage of coastline globally that experienced suitable conditions for Vibrio infections and summarised the results across three latitudinal bands (northern latitudes = 40-70N; tropical latitudes = 25S-40N; and southern latitudes = 25-40S). Second, we calculated suitability in two focal regions in which human Vibrio infection is frequently observed, the Baltic Sea and the North East coast of North America (36-50N). For the Baltic (main text) and NE US coast (Supp Materials), we show the percentage of coastline suitable for Vibrio infections. In addition, for the Baltic (main text) we show the number of days per year suitable for outbreaks. The percentage change figures reported in the main text were calculated relative to a 1980s baseline (5 year average, 1982-86), either an average for the 2010s (5 year average, 2013-2017) to illustrate the overall trend accounting for interannual variability or for the most recent year for which data were available (2017).	1
Malaria Context Temperature, precipitation and relative humidity are climatic factors that impact the abundance and feeding cycle rate of Anopheles mosquitoes, which transmit the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. Temperature also drives the development rate of Plasmodium parasites within the mosquito vectors (Grover-Kopec et al., 2006). Temperatures within the range 18C to 32C are considered most suitable for P. falciparum, while P. vivax has a lower temperature limit (Gilles 1999). Below 15/18C the development of the parasite ceases while above 32C the survival of the mosquito is compromised. Relative humidity greater than 60% is also considered as a requirement for the mosquito to survive long enough for the parasite to develop sufficiently to be transmitted to the human host stage. Rainfall and surface water are needed for the egg laying and larval stages of the mosquito life cycle, with monthly rainfall accumulation of at least 80mm considered suitable for transmission (Grover-Kopec et al., 2016). A recent study found a significant increase in elevation of the lower temperature limits for the development of malaria parasites in Ethiopia (Lyon et al. 2017). Increasing temperatures in the region are eroding the perceived barrier to malaria transmission, allowing more favourable conditions to begin climbing into densely populated highland areas. Highland areas are the most	1
densely populated agro-climatic zone in sub-Saharan Africa, occupying just 4.4% of the land area but 19.4% (44 million) of the population. The malaria indicator focuses on mapping environmental suitability globally, while considering the variation in malaria burden by region, management status, and elevation. Methods The number of months suitable for malaria transmission per year from 1950 - 2016 was calculated globally. Suitability is based on empirically-derived thresholds of precipitation, temperature and relative humidity for two primary parasites causing malaria (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax). Monthly observations of temperature, precipitation and vapour pressure data from the Climate Research Unit (CRU TS4.01) (Harris et al. 2014) were downloaded using the KNMI Climate Explorer ( The variables were extracted at a 0.5 spatial resolution over land. Elevation data at a 0.5 spatial resolution was obtained from JISAO, University of Washington ( Following New et al., (2002), relative humidity (RH) was estimated using the formula:  =	1
where  is vapour pressure and  is saturated vapour pressure (in hPa) at mean air temperature T in C, given by:  = 6.108 exp[17.27  /(237.3 + )] .	1
Climatic suitability was defined as the coincidence of precipitation accumulation greater than 80 mm, average temperature between 18C and 32C, and relative humidity greater than 60% for P. falciparum (Grover-Kopec et al. 2006). Suitability for P. vivax was calculated using the same thresholds with the exception of a lower average temperature limit of 15C (Gilles, 1999; Patz and Olson, 2006). The combined values are an indication of the lower limit for potential malaria transmission for each species. The mean number of months per year with suitable climate conditions for malaria transmission was then calculated across 3 continents (Africa, Asia and the Americas) according to the dominant parasite present (Africa = P falciparum, other regions = P. vivax) ( We further subdivided the analysis by malaria management status, following country classifications from Newby et al., (2016) who classified countries in the following categories: malaria controlling, malaria eliminating, or malaria free. Here we include outputs for the category malaria controlling (Main Text and Supp. Materials) and malaria eliminating countries. In addition to management status, we stratified the analysis by elevation to contrast trends in highland areas (>=1500m) and lowland areas (<1500m). The percentage change figures reported in the main text were calculated relative to a 1950s baseline (5 year average, 1950-54), either as an average for the 2010s (5 year average, 2012-2016) to illustrate the overall trend accounting for interannual variability or for the most recent year for which data were available (2016).	1

Publication trends Methods for the analysis of publication trends on climate-sensitive infectious diseases follow Lu and Peng (2017), updated to the most recent complete year for which data were available (2017). Briefly, we conducted a systematic review of the literature using bibliographic databases	1
including the ISI Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PubMed. We used a multi-step approach, first searching abstract/title/keywords using strings of [(`climate change' or `climate') and `infectious disease'], followed by retention of articles focussing on disease in humans. Then, a second round of searching using further keywords describing more specific climate-disease elements was conducted. Finally, a manual screen according to specific rules (namely, we removed duplicated, non-English, non-peer reviewed, non-human related articles and those that did not report a health outcome related to climate change, such as review, editorial, or commentary articles) was performed. Essential article information was extracted from each paper for the summary, including: 1) direct information including the title, journal, publishing year, authors; 2) place name and spatial scale of the study area; 3) study period; 4) research methods used; 5) types of infectious disease studied; 6) types of climatic variable studied; and 7) the conclusions made about the direction of impacts of climate change on human infectious disease.	1
As above. Each of the disease indicators reported here focus on environmental suitability, as determined by climatic conditions known to enhance infection risks. For malaria and Vibrio these are based on the intersection of climatic thresholds known to be limiting for the growth or transmission of the respective pathogens. For dengue, the vectorial capacity (VC) output is derived from a mechanistic model that includes parameters that are both climate-sensitive and insensitive to climate. The VC model thus reflects the contribution of vector, pathogen and host traits to disease transmission in addition to capturing the climatic components of disease risk. Dengue Key caveats and limitations of the VC model and its parameterisation are fully described in LiuHelmersson et al., (2014, 2016). VC should not be confused with actual dengue cases, although it is an indicator of the risk of infection.	1
Vibrio The results are derived on the basis of suitable SST and SSS conditions only, and do not include other potentially important drivers (e.g. globalisation), environmental predictors of pathogenic Vibrio infections (e.g., cholorphyll-a, turbidity) nor disease case data. Nevertheless, these associations have been explored and are reported in the supporting references included above. In the global analysis, the slope of the trendlines over the time series is mostly flat for the tropical/subtropical region and the southern hemisphere. However, the SST-only suitability shows a strong upward trend in the southern hemisphere, indicating that on average temperature conditions are also improving growth conditions for Vibrio in these areas, while SSS is generally limiting. However, locally suitable SSS conditions will also occur in these regions on the basis of, for example, variation in local rainfall and river runoff, which can make these regions sporadically suitable for Vibrio infections.	1
Malaria These results are based on climatic data, not malaria case data. The malaria suitability climate thresholds used are based on a consensus of the literature. In practice, the optimal and limiting conditions for transmission are dependent on the particular species of the parasite and vector (Grover-Kopec et al. 2006). Control efforts might limit the impact of these climate changes on malaria or conversely, the climate suitability may either enhance or hamper control efforts (Snow et al. 2017). The disease indicators will be reported upon annually and assessed against the baseline data and trends presented here. Other climate-sensitive infectious diseases in addition to malaria, Vibrio and dengue will be added through time and the current indicators refined. In future, we intend to expand efforts to project trends (as for dengue) using available models (e.g., RCPs from AR5). In addition we may expand efforts to link environmental suitability information to disease outcomes e.g., via disease case or surveillance data. Numerous jurisdictions currently already undertake indicator- (e.g., annual country- or regional-level reporting of confirmed human cases), event-based (e.g., outbreak investigation and `epidemic intelligence'), and biosecurity (e.g., sentinel site) surveillance for infectious diseases, vectors or key zoonotic hosts. Many of these datasets and methods of analysis could be made available and leveraged in future for the Lancet Countdown. For example, EU member states already report cases of notifiable diseases, zoonotic diseases, and outbreaks of food-borne and zoonotic disease, while vector surveillance remains voluntary (Lindgren et al., 2012). 1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.9 Food security and undernutrition 1.9.1 Terrestrial food security and undernutrition Ten-year average yields Data for trends in yield by country, are calculated in the following way. First, time series yield data for grains (aggregated) were collected for all countries from 1960 to 2016 from FAOSTAT. To enable consistency across time, where countries have become independent/split after 1960, data from their pre-independence status are used. Thus, for Slovakia, for example, pre-1989, Soviet Union data are used; 1989-1992 Czechoslovakia data are used; and from 1993 onwards, Slovakia data are used. A moving ten-year average yield was then calculated for each country.	1
Finally, whether that average has been trending upwards or downwards over a ten-year period was determined. Prevalence and number of people under-nourished Data are sourced directly from FAOSTAT. Crop duration loss Actual crop yields vary from year to year not only with variations in weather, but also with changes in variety, farming practices and the occurrence of pest and disease. Crop yields as estimated by crop models are sensitive to the precise form of the crop model, and many models do not account for the short-term extremes that can significantly affect yields. The effect of year-to-year climatic variability on crop yields is therefore here represented by an agriclimatological proxy indicator, calculated from observed climate data and characterising potential variability in maize yield. Maize is selected because it is an important traded and subsistence crop. There are several potential proxies for maize yield, including the number of hot days during critical periods in the growing season (e.g. Lobell et al., 2011a;b; Gourdji et al., 2013; Challinor et al., 2016) and the accumulated temperature between lower and upper thresholds over the growing season (e.g. Challinor et al., 2016). The proxy used here is based on crop duration, defined as the time taken in a year to accumulate the average growing season accumulated temperature (Challinor et al., 2016). If the accumulated temperature total is reached early, then the crop matures quickly and yields are lower than average. Here, we define the crop duration loss as the difference in the time taken to accumulate the average growing season accumulated temperature. The index is calculated at a spatial resolution of 0.5x0.5o, across the area of land under maize cultivation (Monfreda et al., 2008). It is assume that the growing season is 110 days long, and starts each year at the average planting date (Sacks et al., 2010). Accumulated temperature is calculated between a lower threshold of 7oC and an upper threshold of 30oC (Challinor et al., 2016), with higher temperature capped at 30oC. Climate data are taken from the CRU TS4 gridded monthly observed climate data set (Harris et al., 2014), and synthetic daily data are estimated for each grid cell by applying a regional average daily anomaly to the monthly value. The regional average daily anomaly is calculated from the WATCH (Weedon et al., 2011) daily climatology.	1
As above. Crop duration loss Different ways of calculating the agri-climate index using different data sets would produce slightly different time series, as would the use of different agri-climate proxies. However, the broad patterns of variability over space and time are likely to be consistent across proxies and data sources. For 2018 we only have data for maize. In future years we aim to incorporate additional staple crops for the agri-climate index	1
1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.9 Vulnerability of food systems and under-nutrition 1.9.2 Marine food security and undernutrition Thirteen large marine basins (FAO fishing areas) which are important in terms of projected impacts and vulnerabilities associated with climate change were selected (Table S2). The basins analysed represent major marine ecosystems in terms of climate, ecosystem and geographical diversity (tropical, subtropical, and arctic zones) and are major FAO fishing areas; thus changes in SST and marine primary productivity can have significant impacts on marine life and fish stocks. Twenty-one countries located in these basins were selected in order to attribute the impacts of climate change (more specifically sea surface temperature; SST) to deterioration of major coral reef sites (internationally protected areas) and the consequent decreased consumption of capture-based fish. SST data availability ranged from 2003 to 2015 and therefore, to obtain the highest data alignment possible, the data considered on coral reef sites (NOAA Coral Reef Watch Zones) were those of 31 August 2009 and 2015. Moreover, the data concerning both capture-based and farmed-based per capita fish consumption in the investigated countries from 1980-2015 were collected and analysed. There is a lack of information in the available databases such as FAO on fish species composition of the captured and farmed fish products. This could in turn lead to some concerns about the methodological approach used to calculate 3 intake. More specifically, most of the approaches are based on fish intake, which usually ignore or underestimate	1
variations in 3 contents of different types of fishes, and especially capture-based compared with farmed-based fish. Given the unfavourable variations in fish capture over the last three decades, it seems that countries in general have implemented strategies toward increased fish farming to compensate for decreased capture-based per capita fish consumption. However, owing to the substantially lower 3 contents of farmed fish compared with captured fish, positive health impacts of this approach is in question. Therefore, it is suggested to obtain the composition of the captured and farmed fish products. Such findings could assist in more accurately assessing 3 intake and the consequent human health-related impacts as influenced by climate change through jeopardizing marine primary production or in another word, marine-based food security and nutrition. Moreover, the resultant implications could serve as guidelines for the policy makers and the authorities of the agriculture & fisheries/import & export departments to more effectively plan in favour of high 3 content fish species. For instance, future efforts could be directed toward shifting the existing fish farming activities from fresh water (in-land waters) to marine water (mariculture systems).

Note: As quoted from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch Operational Near-real-time Twice-weekly Global 50 km Satellite Coral Bleaching Thermal Stress Monitoring Product Suite, "Bleaching Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) is the 12-week accumulation of HotSpot values that are at least 1oC. A DHW value of one is equivalent to one week of HotSpot at 1oC and a DHW of two is equivalent to two weeks of HotSpot at 1oC or one week of HotSpot at 2oC. The Bleaching HotSpot is a special type of SST anomaly showing the difference between the nighttime SST and the maximum monthly mean (MMM) SST climatology. The HotSpot data contain only positive values for identifying potential thermal stress conducive to coral bleaching."	1
1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.10 Migration and population displacement This Appendix covers two sets of case studies for which climate change is the sole contributing factor for forced migration, as described in peer-reviewed academic papers. First, updates from the list of case studies in Watts et al. (2017). Second, any new case studies listed in the literature. For the Carteret Islands of Papua New Guinea, some authors (e.g. Schwerdtle et al. 2018) continue to attribute the forced migration to climate change, even suggesting that sea wall construction failed to protect the islands from erosion. Conversely, Connell (2016) downplays climate change impacts for the moment, instead considering natural cycles and local human changes including sea wall construction as causing witnessed erosion. The Carteret Islands are thus no longer considered by the literature as being a clear case study of climate change migration. Connell (2016) reinforces that Takuu, Papua New Guinea would also not be considered such a case study. Coastal Fijian villages including Vunidogoloa, Narikoso, and Denimanu continue to be mentioned as relocating due to climate change (McNamara and Des Combes, 2016 with this discourse critiqued in Hermann and Kempf 2017). While evidence is presented of coastal changes necessitating relocation, evidence is not presented to link those coastal changes to climate change impacts. Again, it might be that sea walls have caused or exacerbated the observed erosion. Coastal Alaskan villages remain highlighted as case studies for climate change migration, although with no updates to the numbers (Albert et al. 2018). Louisiana's Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments Program (LA SAFE) has started to be described in peer-reviewed papers (Herrmann 2017; King 2017), suggesting that the numbers of people considered as climate change migrants from Louisiana might increase slightly from this location. Nonetheless, human changes other than climate change affecting this coastline include river engineering, pollution, dredging, infrastructure construction, and resource extraction. Continuing empirical observations of low-lying atolls, such as for Tuvalu (Kench et al. 2018), currently confirm that, with measurable sea-level rise, prospects nonetheless remain for habitation through adaptation, which means that appropriate action is needed to avoid forced migration. For Kiribati, Hermann and Kempf (2017) deconstruct the country's land purchase in Fiji which has been attributed to the intention for all people of Kiribati to become climate change migrants. They explain how the official governmental rendering of the purchase is for economic and food reasons related to climate change, but not migration, even though several authors presume the migration link without evidence. Meanwhile, Solomon Islands villages relocating were reaffirmed to have non-climate change factors as major influences on the environmental changes which are forcing movement, along with decisions being made to relocate now due to assumptions that sea-level rise would eventually force movement in the future (Albert et al. 2018). Countries with low-lying atolls remain ambiguous as case studies for climate change migration.	1

(b) The rate of sea-level rise is expected to accelerate in coming years (Fasllo et al. 2016; Watson 2016).	1
(c) Sea-level is 0.71  0.20 mm/y slower than expected because the climate is driving increasing water storage on land (Reager et al., 2016). (d) Sea level might have natural, multi-decadal oscillations (Serazin et al., 2016). People from many locations are assumed to be migrating due to the possibilities given as being climate change only, but analysis shows that the assumptions are not always supported (Table 3). In fact, no outcome is certain. Even for coral reefs, Perry et al. (2015) postulate that coral growth under some scenarios could keep up with sea-level rise and other ecosystem changes. Corals' ability to flourish under rapid sea-level changes was demonstrated empirically in the Solomon Islands by Saunders et al. (2016) after sudden tectonic subsidence. Similarly, mangroves so far are demonstrating robustness to sea-level changes while nevertheless being damaged by human activity (Woodroffe et al. 2010). A linear cause-effect assumption is made of: climate change (impacts)  migration  health impacts Each step has nuances, subtleties, and provisos. For the first step, migration due to climate change (impacts) only is hard to discern because migration has always happened throughout human history for multiple reasons, some climate- and environment- related; some not linked at all to climate or environmental factors; and most often due to a combination of factors. Many assumptions behind migration potentially linked to climate change are hard to prove as being climate change only or are challenging to differentiate from many other environmental factors, such as specific natural hazards or changes to food, water, and/or livelihood conditions which manifest for multiple reasons. For the second step, migration itself, no matter how or why migration occurs, does not necessarily induce specific health outcomes. Migrant and host health could be improved, worsened, or not affected, depending on how the migration is handled.	1
Consequently, the main caveats for this indicator is that no linear cause-effect sequence happens, mainly because the outcomes from a situation depends much more on how a situation is dealt with than on climate change or migration per se. Two main prospects exist for this indicator's future. The first is observational. As estimates and observations of sea-level rise, ocean acidification, sea ice, and coastal erosion continue, the indicator's thresholds might change. The second is how the indicator is constructed. Consideration could be given to how managing migration affects health in order to overcome a principal caveat. Irrespective, this caveat can never be fully overcome because health impacts can be managed, if we choose to do so, irrespective of climate change or migration scenarios or realities. In later iterations of this indicator, descriptions can be provided of locations which have switched categories, been removed entirely, or been added as new. As these iterations approach 2030, the tables given for each indicator are likely to expand substantially because the number of studies is expanding immensely on (i) observed climate change impacts with confirmed attribution, (ii) projecting such impacts into the future; and (iii) migration linked to climate change. Consequently, the potential impacts of climate change on migration are likely to become much clearer towards 2030, including possible case studies where such migration has occurred. Caution is still needed regarding numerous cases where attribution is stated with confidence, but the link upon closer examination is not robust. While the indicator here is	1
presented in a highly focused and rigid manner, in order to keep it scientifically precise and robust, expanding knowledge and observations might permit the indicator in 2030 to be much more comprehensive and less narrow without losing robustness. Given the complexity of the observational science and the challenges articulated by the caveats, the ideal form of this indicator given adequate time and resource would be a map of all potential migration location origins under different climate change scenarios, animated over time to 2100. Although climate change projections are published for the next 10,000 years (Clarke et al., 2016), social and technological changes will be immense over such time scales, making it difficult to provide any confidence for suggestions regarding how and where people will live and be responding to environmental stimuli long into the future. If people choose to settle other planets, solar systems, or galaxies over the next several millennia in order to escape a dying Earth--as much science fiction (not peer reviewed) has postulated-- would they be climate (change) migrants? Such questions are beyond the scope of Lancet Countdown. Consequently, to achieve this proposed map with scientific value, it should not go beyond 2100 and at least one dedicated post-doctoral researcher would be needed, preferably with a GIS and migration specialty because the number of caveats, provisos, uncertainties, and attribution challenges would lead to multiple layers and indicators on a map.	1
To improve the estimates, other than specific case study updates, further research would aim to model (i) the percentage contribution of climate change to migrationrelated decisions and (ii) the length of time which migration-related decisions are brought forward due to climate change impacts. A third area for further work is to compile and estimate the number of people worldwide who are forced not to migrate with climate change as the sole contributing factor. Locations possibly needing to migrate due to climate change only The proviso `possibly' in this title refers to technical solutions being developed to help the people stay in or near their current locations, irrespective of the climate change factors mentioned. These schemes include artificial settlements floating above or built directly on the current locations (Yamamoto et al., 2014), whether above an island being submerged, an eroding coastline, or destabilised permafrost. Financing for these technical proposals has so far been absent and does not seem likely in the near future, plus technical challenges remain. Nonetheless, they are possibilities and it is difficult to project the social and political make-up of the world over the coming decades. The range of possibilities covers shifting the trillions of dollars per year in military spending and fossil fuel subsidies to tackling climate change all the way through to abandoning anyone affected by climate change through refusing to permit them entry into other countries. The most likely outcomes are somewhere in between such extremes. Consequently, the migration of these territories remains `possibly' rather than `definitely'. Additionally, defining `migrating' for this category is not straightforward. Does it mean moving house, street, municipality, island, or country? Would it include moving 5 m, 50 m, 500 m, or 5 km? For example Pingelap atoll in the Federated States of Micronesia has significant area above 15 m above sea level but all land is within 300 m of the coast. If the people of Pingelap move their houses or move to different houses due to	1
sea-level rise, is that migration, because they are still living in effectively the same location? If so, then a street-by-street census would be needed of Pingelap and every other coastline in the world to determine exactly who would need to migrate, due to regional and local variations in how sea-level rise manifests. Consequently, a country rather than community level is presented (Table 4), identifying the countries which might (not definitely) not be able to remain as countries under thermal expansion. Apart from those people already migrating due to climate change, this indicator yields four countries totalling a population of 584,000 people possibly needing to migrate due to thermal expansion. All four are small island developing states (SIDS), but this is coincidental; all countries have been considered. Locations possibly needing to migrate due to thermal expansion Location Kiribati	1
Notes Has plenty of high ground above 10 m above sea level, but little is habitable or viable for large populations. Highest point is 2.4 m above sea level. Highest point is 10 m above sea level.	1
As a guess, the countries in Table 4 would need to migrate between 2040 and 2050. This statement is a guess, because the decision to migrate will most likely be political strongly influenced by specific extreme events rather than a strategic analysis of possible futures and outcomes from those futures. This statement is made on the basis of history and how societies have typically dealt with disasters and creeping environmental changes. As well, other countries could rapidly be added to Table 4. If coral reefs around Fiji or Seychelles experience high mortality, then near-coastal areas could potentially experience rapid erosion. Two provisos preclude large numbers of people in each country, or significant parts thereof, from being forced to migrate. First, while far from an ideal approach, extensive coastal engineering (which both countries already implement) could forestay major coastal erosion. Second, plenty of land is available in those countries which could theoretically take migrants--although with practical problems regarding access, ownership, and heritage protection--and few people would necessarily need to migrate far in theory, leading to the problem of defining `migration' mentioned above. If land tenure or ecosystem protection precludes settling in areas, is the root cause of migration farther afield climate change or local human decisions regarding land? All these factors emphasise the `possibly' word in this indicator's title. They also highlight that this indicator's value is a minimum, from Table 5's numbers, but many more possibilities for migrants exist under this category--most notably erosion linked to sea ice disappearance. Locations which might possibly need to migrate only due to climate change, if ice sheet collapse occurs In the coming decades, the numbers of people migrating due to ice sheet collapse is likely to be near zero. The reason is that the collapse process itself followed by ice melt and sea-level rise takes a minimum of decades and possibly up to centuries. As we	1
move from the decade scale to the century scale, it is impossible to project social and technological developments. It is too simplistic and it would be indefensible to just calculate the number of people living within a certain elevation above sea level-- especially since over the coming decades, these population numbers will change. Nonetheless, some websites host data on population in coastal zones such as Columbia University  and the World Bank  but these are not part of the peer-reviewed literature. The UN has also developed the indicator `Percentage of Total Population Living in Coastal Areas'	1
as_coasts/pop_coastal_areas.pdf into which the World Bank and Columbia University data input, but again, it is not published in the peer-reviewed literature. Instead, peerreviewed publications provide the following analyses: * In 1990, 450 million people lived within 20 km coast and below 20 m above sea level (Small and Nicholls, 2003). The provided plots permit higher resolution estimates to be obtained with reasonable precision, but accuracy is questionable. * In 1994, 1.88 billion people (33.5% of the global population) lived below 100 m above sea level (Cohen and Small, 1998), which was the highest vertical resolution investigated. * In 2000, 634 million (10% of the global population), of whom 360 million are urban, lived below 10 m above sea level (McGranahan et al., 2007), which was the highest vertical resolution investigated. * With 2000 as a baseline, the population living below 10 m above sea level and connected to the ocean will change from 638 million to, depending on the societal scenario chosen, 1,005-1,091 million by 2050 and 830-1,184 million by 2100 (Merkins et al., 2016). * With 2000 as a baseline, the population living below 10 m above sea level on contiguous land which borders a major body of water will change from 702.167 million to, depending on the societal scenario chosen, 492.74-1,145.946 million by 2100 (Jones and O'Neill, 2016). * The number of people living below 5 m above sea level is calculated to be 290 million (5.4%) in 1990, 380 million (5.6%) in 2010, and 460 million (5.5%) in 2030 (Kummu et al. 2016). * For 2000-2006, 67.1-153.1 million people live below 1 m above sea level; 308.1391.4 million people live below 5 m above sea level; and 557.1-709.1 million people live below 10 m above sea level (values are also available for below 2, 3, and 4 m above sea level) depending on the models used (Lichter et al. 2011). This paper also provides a review of similar literature to date, which plenty of further estimates of the coastal population. Consequently, this indicator yields zero extra people migrating due to ice sheet collapse by 2100; that is, no one would need to migrate who are not already migrating. After 2100 and in ensuing centuries--without appropriate action--based on the above literature, as an order of magnitude, perhaps over one billion people +/- 50% might need to migrate due to ice sheet collapse. This estimate is based on ice sheet collapse only; as noted above, has low robustness because it is mainly guesswork with large errors; and has no relation to the estimates of `climate migrants' and `climate change refugees' which have been debunked by Gemenne (2011) and Hartmann (2010). Instead, it simply states that if ice sheets collapse and in the absence of major social and technological changes (an unlikely situation by	1
Death rates due to self-harm (suicide) data for females and males for each state and territory were taken from the Australian Bureau of Statistics standardised death rates for every year of the decade 2007-16 (latest available year at the time of writing). Standardised rates are deaths per 100,000 of estimated mid-year population adjusted for age structures (see	1
16~Main%20Features~Intentional%20selfharm:%20key%20characteristics~7). With 28 (5.71%) missing values, we were able to extract a total of 132 observations for the decade (8 jurisdictions * 10 years * 2 sexes, less 28 missing values). We did not impute missing values primarily because death rates are highly variable across years and jurisdictions and imputation would have led to the introduction of too much error. We identified two extreme outliers in suicide rates, both from the NT, one for males in 2007 and one for females in 2015. These outliers heavily biased initial results and were removed. To match the death rates time series, mean annual maximum temperatures for each state and territory were calculated from Bureau of Meteorology climate data archives for every year of the same decade, 2007-16 (see	1
Maximum annual recorded temperatures for each weather station in each district in each jurisdiction were summed and the total value was divided by the number of observations to derive a mean annual maximum temperature for that year. This process was repeated for all eight jurisdictions for each of ten years, delivering a total of 77 observations (there were no data for WA for 2007-09). An identical process was used to derive the mean difference between each annual temperature observation and the long-term moving mean (calculated from all available data). This delivered 76 observations with four missing data points. In both cases, there were missing values for a very small number of weather stations in some jurisdictions in some years. We did not impute these missing values but used the available data from the weather stations in that district and all the other districts to calculate mean scores for that state/territory for that year. Following initial exploratory analyses, data for Antarctica (district 300, Macquarie Island) were removed from the dataset for Tasmania because these data were extreme outliers and heavily biased initial results. For example, in 2015 (an average year with no deviation from the long-term mean), the maximum temperature from the Macquarie Island station was 6.6C when the equivalent value for the rest of Tasmania was 16.57C with a mean variation of +0.18C.	1
We began by conducting one-way analyses of variance to test whether mean suicide rates and mean maximum annual temperatures differed significantly by jurisdiction. All means on both variables differed significantly from all other means indicating that each state and territory had its own unique heat and suicide profile for the decade 2007-16. Pearson Product Moment correlations indicated that, nationally over the decade, suicide rates were significantly but weakly positively correlated with mean maximum annual temperatures (r=.23, p-value<.05). In a multiple linear regression model, sex and temperature each made statistically independent contributions to explaining variance in suicide rates. A scatterplot was produced to examine the shape of the relationship; in contrast to a linear regression line, which fit the data significantly but weakly for males and nonsignificantly for females (Figure 1a), a cubic regression line fit the data optimally and well for both females and males (Figure 1b). It also appeared evident from the scatterplot that the pattern of associations between suicide and temperature differed by sex (two clearly separate groups of observations were evident as shown below; blue markers = males, green markers = females). To test this, we conducted a linear regression analysis using sex and mean maximum annual temperature as simultaneous predictors of suicide rate, controlling for annual state-level temperature anomalies to hold constant annual deviation from the long-term mean. Standardised beta coefficients indicated that both predictors significantly independently predicted suicide rate, sex particularly strongly, such that higher temperatures and being male predicted a higher suicide rate. Standardised residuals statistics indicated the possible presence of two different groups (reflecting the findings from the scatterplots). The sample was therefore split by sex and separate analyses were conducted for males and females. These analyses fit the data slightly better for males but not for females, for whom the results were nonsignificant. This was inconsistent with the findings from the scatterplots. The introduction into the regression analysis of dummy variables for seven of the states and territories (NSW, the most populous state, was the reference category) produced a strong model, adding substantively to the model fit, and revealed that, when accounting for state/territory, temperature was a much stronger predictor of suicide than the previous models indicated. We noticed that some of the beta coefficients were negative (indicating higher suicide rates in the presence of cooler weather). Based on exploratory analyses, the states were allocated to one of two groups based on their mean maximum annual temperatures, warm (NSW, VIC, QLD, SA, WA, NT) or cool (TAS, ACT). Separate regression analyses by warm or cool state/territory categories produced well-fitting linear associations between mean maximum annual temperature and suicide rate, and revealed sex differences in the nature and strength of this relationship (see main text).	1
population size and age profile. However, there are well-rehearsed problems with suicide data, problems that cannot easily be overcome (such as suspected substantial under-reporting). Thus, to establish patterns of relationship between unusually hot or cool weather and mental health, investigations using other mental health outcomes will be needed. Using mean maximum annual temperature is a crude measure of exposure to unusually hot or cool weather, especially in states and territories with substantial climate variation (e.g., NSW has hot dry desert, wet sub-tropical, cold mountainous and temperate coastal climate zones). Annual temperature also fails to account for seasonal variation in weather, which is associated with mental health and suicide. Further, only ten years of data have been analysed and so we cannot account for longer-term trends or for exposures and impacts in previous years. Additionally, population size, characteristics and dispersion vary enormously among jurisdictions. The use of more finegrained (but still substantively meaningful) geographic resolution will help address these problems and also permit within-year analyses which are not possible with a cell size of eight states and territories. This indicator, if used in future years, will be refined to account for these data limitations and opportunities. We found preliminary evidence of important interactions between gender, location, underlying climate and suicide. This is not the appropriate place to analyse these factors but they need to be investigated in detail because they have substantive implications for policy and service development and, ultimately, for human health and wellbeing. In this respect, the jurisdictionlevel analysis that we have conducted is useful and appropriate because state and territory governments are key actors in adaptation planning and implementation, and in health and related service delivery. Finally, we found no clear upward or downward trend nationally in the strength of the association between mean maximum annual temperature and rates of death by self-harm over the decade and the reason for this will need to be investigated at finer spatial resolution.	1
2. Adaptation, planning and resilience for health 2.1 National adaptation strategies or plans for health The collection of data for the number of countries having a national health and climate strategy or plan approved by the relevant government was explained in the Lancet Countdown report in 2017 (Watts et al, 2017). Briefly, WHO has been actively engaged with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in developing tools for more systematic provision of country specific information and monitoring of progress on protecting human health from climate change. This collaboration, which involves working closely with national health authorities, has led to the development of the WHO UNFCCC climate and health country profiles. The country profiles present evidence on the climate hazards, expected health impacts, potential health co-benefits of mitigation actions and national policy response in countries. In 2015, WHO launched a biennial national survey, entitled the "WHO Climate and Health Country Survey" to monitor national progress on climate and health action. Findings from the survey are reported in the climate and health country profiles and were used to report on health adaptation indicators in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report. The survey was conducted for the second time in 2017/2018 yet the results are currently pending publication. Consequently, an update for this indicator, based on the 2017/2018 WHO Climate and Health Country Survey, is planned for the 2019 Lancet Countdown report. The interim information provided in this report therefore focuses on a qualitative analysis of national strategies and plans to gain insight into key questions regarding the development, content and quality of these documents. Sixteen national health adaptation strategies/plans were collected and analysed for the following countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Cook Islands, Egypt, Ethiopia, Jordan, Laos, Madagascar, Morocco, Nepal, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania and Tunisia. It should be noted that the aim of this review was to collect the most recent and available documents and therefore, the strategies and plans assessed do not necessarily correspond directly to those reported in the 2017 Lancet Countdown Report. The countries with H-NAPS were Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nepal, Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania. It is anticipated that with the availability of necessary resources, support and key guidance tools, such as the WHO Operational framework for building climate resilient health systems, the number of low and middle income countries developing HNAPs as part of the NAP process will steadily increase in coming years (WHO, 2015). The qualitative analysis evaluated the available national health adaptation strategies/plans through the use of a standard assessment tool. The assessment tool consisted of nine key questions, outlined below: 1. The title of the document (to gain more understanding of the nature and scope of the document, e.g. strategy, plan, health component of the NAP). 2. The timeframe identified in the document. 3. Identifying if the document was developed as part of the UNFCCC NAP process. If so, was there a clear plan of coordination and synergy with health determining sectors to ensure that the H-NAP was established in a coherent manner with regard to the overall NAP. 4. Were gaps in capacity and knowledge identified? 5. The prioritized health outcomes.	1
6. Which of the ten health system components outlined in the WHO Operational framework for building climate resilience were addressed in the document (WHO, 2015)? 7. Was a clear implementation strategy developed for integrating climate change adaptation into health-related planning processes at all levels? 8. Was the development of a national monitoring and evaluation system for health adaptation to climate variability and change anticipated? 9. Would the strategy/plan be subjected to regular revision and updating in future? Collection of national health adaptation strategy/plan documents was based on voluntary submission through the WHO Climate and Health Country Survey combined with outreach to ministry of health and national health authority focal points through WHO country and regional offices to request the most recent and publicly available documents. The collected national health strategies/plans do not represent an exhaustive search of all national health adaptation documents for all WHO Member States and new documents or revised documents may be available at the time of publication. As such, the results of this evaluation should be considered indicative not conclusive. The WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will be conducted biennially and will continue to be the primary source of data to track this indicator. This indicator will be updated biennially as new data from the survey is published. The goal over the long-term is to gather data from all WHO member States, however as the coverage of the survey will expand over time, the next update of data from the 2017/2018 WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will aim to provide data on approximately 80 WHO Member States. The future evolution of this indicator will explore the monitoring and review of the existing strategies/plans and progress on level of implementation of strategies/plans. With more countries initiating the NAP process, alignment of the health component with the overall NAP will also be more closely monitored. Interim information regarding the specific content of national strategies/plans, as explored in this qualitative analysis, may be re-assessed in the future. 2. Adaptation, planning and resilience for health 2.2 City assessments of climate change risks CDP serves as an official reporting platform for the Compact of Mayors, and administrates, collects and analyses a global survey of city based environmental and climate change data on an annual basis. In 2016, 553 cities participated in the survey, with 449 reporting publically that included questions on emissions, adaptation assessments and plans. Respondents to the surveys to describe the magnitude of the impact of climate based hazards (extremely serious, serious, less serious) and identify three critical assets or services that may be most impacted. 7 regions were represented in the survey (Africa (n = 45, 9%), East Asia (n = 16, 3%), Europe (n = 118, 25%), Latin America (n = 123, 26%), North America (n = 137, 29%), South and West Asia (n = 9, 2%) and South Asia & Oceania (n = 30, 6%). There were no respondents from the Middle East. Respondents to the surveys to describe the magnitude of the impact of climate based hazards (extremely serious, serious, less serious) and identify three critical assets or services that may be most impacted. Based on this data two indicators can be developed. The first is a global cities-based indicator of government areas that have undertaken a climate change risk or vulnerability assessment. The second is global cities-based indicator of the perceived vulnerability of health infrastructure to climate change. In terms of trend analysis for the indicators, it is	1
important to note that there was a change in the options offered for the variable that the perceived vulnerability of health infrastructure to climate change indicator is based. In 2016 the health infrastructure option was labelled "Health and Community" infrastructure. To make the option more specific to health infrastructure, in 2017 this option was divided into "Public Health" and "Community & Culture". In terms of comparability and continuity, in 2016, 49% of cities chose Community and Culture as the infrastructure they perceived to be most vulnerable to climate change. This rate was held constant in 2017 with 51% of cities noting that they perceived climate change would seriously impact Public Health infrastructure. Furthermore only 2% indicated that they believed Community and Culture Infrastructure would be vulnerable to climate change. This would further indicate that the majority of cities choosing the Health & Community indicator in 2016 were selecting this option as they perceived the greatest threat was to public health infrastructure rather than community infrastructure. Using the World Bank (WB) country income category groupings (High, Upper middle, Lower Middle and Low income) Table 1 indicates that 58% of cities that responded to the survey are from High Income countries, 30% are from Upper Middle-Income countries, 8% from Lower Middle Income countries and 4% are from Low Income countries. Data Caveats	1
2: Health Resilience and Adaptation 2.3 Implementation of IHR Core Capacity Requirements Under the International Health Regulations (IHR (2005)) all States Parties are required to have or to develop minimum core public health capacities to implement the IHR (2005) effectively. IHR (2005) also states that all States Parties should report to the World Health Assembly annually on the implementation of IHR (2005). In order to facilitate this process, WHO developed an IHR Monitoring questionnaire2, interpreting the Core Capacity Requirements in Annex 1 of IHR (2005) into 20 indicators for 13 capacities. Since 2010, this self-reporting IHR monitoring questionnaire is sent annually to National IHR Focal Points (NFPs) for data collection. It contains a checklist of 20 indicators specifically developed for monitoring the development and implementation of 13 IHR capacities. The method of estimation calculates the proportion/percentage of attributes (a set of specific elements or functions which reflect the level of performance or achievement of a specific indicator) reported to be in place in a country. The core capacities to implement the International Health Regulations (2005) have been established by a technical group of experts, as those capacities required to detect, assess, notify and report events, and to respond to public health risks and emergencies of national and international concern. To assess the development and strengthening of core capacities, a set of components are measured for each of the core capacities, by considering a set of one to three indicators that measure the status and progress in developing and strengthening the IHR core capacities. Each indicator is assessed by using a group of specific elements referred to as `attributes' that represents a complex set of activities or elements required to carry out this component. As it is difficult to measure these indicators with a simple question that requires one `yes' or `no' answer, one to three questions are derived from each attribute, and these are administered through a questionnaire. The status of performance for an indicator, component and core capacity is determined by the presence of attributes. If a country does not indicate a particular attribute as absent or present, it is counted as absent for scoring purposes. The annual questionnaire has been conducted since 2010 with a response rate of 72% in 2012, 66% in 2016 and 85% in 2017, and 100% of countries reporting at least once since 2010. Annual reporting results are complemented by after action reviews, exercises, and joint external evaluation (JEE). International Health Regulations (2005) Annual Reporting. Data are available through the Global Health Observatory Data Repository Human resources capacity reflects human resources available to implement the International Health Regulations Core Capacities. Amongst other attributes, this capacity includes having conducted a human resource needs assessment, as well as having developed appropriate training and staff development plans. Surveillance capacity summarizes two indicators in the IHR questionnaire `Indicator-based surveillance includes an early warning function for early detection of a public health event', and `Event-Based Surveillance is established and functioning'. This capacity score is used here as a proxy for a health system's ability to anticipate and identify outbreaks and changing patterns of climate-sensitive infectious diseases, such as zoonosis and food related outbreaks. Preparedness capacity reflects `Multi-hazard National Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan is developed and implemented', comprised of the	1
presence of a plan, the implementation of the plan, and the ability for this plan to operate under unexpected stress. It also reflects whether `Priority public health risks and resources are mapped and utilized' which includes conducting national risk assessment of various hazards, disease outbreak patterns, local disease transmission patterns, contaminated food or water sources, etc.; as well as mapping of local infrastructure, health facilities, major equipment and supplies, staff, funding sources, experts, equipment, laboratories, institutions, NGOs to assist with community-level work, and transport. Response capacity reflects the availability and functioning of public health emergency response mechanisms, and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) at national and hospital levels.' This capacity is an important proxy for the ability of the health system to mobilize effective response when shocks or stresses are detected There are some limitations to considering these capacities as proxies of health-system adaptive capacity and system resilience. Most importantly, IHR monitoring questionnaires responses are self-reported. Secondly, the countries that report IHR implementation annually differ from year to year within these regional aggregate scores. Thirdly, IHR Core Capacity Requirements are not specific to climate change, and hence whilst they provide a proxy baseline, they do not directly measure a country's adaptive capacity in relation to climate driven risk changes. Fourthly, these findings capture potential capacity - not action. Finally, the quality of surveillance for early detection and warning is not shown and neither is the impact of that surveillance on public health. Response systems have been inadequate in numerous public health emergencies and thus the presence of such plans is not a proxy for their effectiveness. Nonetheless, these four capacities provide a useful starting point to consider the potential adaptive capacity of health systems globally. At the beginning of 2018, in compliance with the recommendations of the IHR Review Committee on Second Extensions for Establishing National Public Health Capacities and on IHR Implementation , and following formal global consultations with States Parties held in 2015, 2016, and 2017, and 2018, the WHO Secretariat replaced the IHR Monitoring questionnaire by the "IHR State Party Self-assessment Annual Reporting Tool" (SPAR). This has strong implication for the future of this indicator: preparedness and response capacities have now been merged into one capacity called "C8: National health emergency framework"; one capacity relevant to climate adaptation and resilience has been added ( "C9: Health services provision"); and a in change capacity grading has been introduced, which requires countries to grade their capacity indicators in progressive levels from 1 to 5 as pose to the previous "Yes/No/Not know answers options. Hence, a new baseline will be generated next year for this indicator and capacity levels will be reported from 1 to 5, instead of in percentage values. The new country self-assessment instrument can be found in the link below: - IHR State Party Self- Assessment Annual Reporting Tool (SPAR) - International Health Regulations (2005) 	1
This indicator computes adaptive capacity of a given country to manage threats posed by infectious diseases taking into account core competency in key areas. The key areas are in surveillance, legislation, Food safety, human resources, laboratory, point of entry, response, preparedness, risk communication and zoonosis which form part of International Health Regulations (IHR) Core Capacity Monitoring Framework5,6. Specifically, this indicator displays how the core capacities influence the abundance of Aedes aegypti vector for each country and aggregated by WHO regions. The IHR core capacities data covers the period 2010-2016, so we present trends for this period. We compute adaptive capacity by taking the product of vectorial capacity (VC) and vector abundance and dividing by the average core capacity. The derived abundance is normalized to range between 0 and 1 before taking the product. The formula below is used for the computation of adaptive capcity. Vulnerability = Impact / Adaptive Capacity We used the temperature dependent dynamic models developed by Jing et al 7to compute Vectorial capacity and the rainfall and temperature dependent abundance model for Aedes aegypti vector abundance computation, an extension of the model developed by Yang et al 8. Computation of VC and abundance estimates was done for each 0.5x0.5 grid points in the CRU dataset and subsequently aggregated to country level using shapefiles. The CRU TS 4.01 9climate data drives both the VC and the abundance models.	1
We compute a composite index by taking average of the 11 core competencies. CRU Ts 4.01,1901-2016 IHR core capacities data, 2010-2016 The abundance models generates predictions and not observed frequencies in relation to climate conditions, and by so should be considered a potential abudance estimate. The IHR data is self-reported by countries and may therefore include reporting bias which would affect this indicator. A reduction of this indicator while keeping the vector hazard constant does not correspond to full protection, but indicates rather that the situation has improved by important improvements in core capacities. The future indicator will make use of the estimated protective effect (relative risk) of the IHR core capacities in modifying the climate induced hazard on vectors and virus interactions.	1

2. Adaptation, planning and resilience for health 2.5 Climate information services for health The number of WMO member states whose Meteorological and Hydrological services are providing climate services to the health sector is calculated based on self-reported information provided by member states to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) through the Country Profile Database Integrated questionnaire. The questionnaire is one of the main source of information to the WMO Country Profile data base and is open all year round for WMO members to update their profile information. Reported data reflects answers to Question number 6.2 of this questionnaire: "Please indicate which user communities/sectors your NMS provides with climate products/information and estimate the extent to which these products are used to improve decisions". "Human Health" is one of multiple sectors which can be chosen. Data reported here reflect answers as for February 28th, 2018. World Meteorological Organization Country Profile data base, which can be consulted online at  Full list of countries providing climate services: Angola, Argentina, Antigua y Barbuda, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Barbados, Chile, China, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Cyprus, Dominica, Egypt, Spain, Finland, Fiji, France, Georgia, Guinea-Bissau, Croatia, Hungary, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Republic of Korea, Lesotho, Latvia, Morocco, Mexico, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Mali, Mozambique, Malawi, Peru, Philippines, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Singapore, El Salvador, Serbia, Sao Tome and Principe, Slovenia, Chad, Trinidad and Tobago, United Republic of Tanzania, Ukraine, United States of America, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, South Africa.	1
Regarding the second part of the indicator - See names within the text bellow. Feel free to include them wherever you want. from the 47 countries that provided additional detail on the status of climate service provision to the health sector: 10 reported to have initiated engagement with the health sector (Chile, Guinea- Bissau, Kuwait, Mexico, Mozambique, Malawi, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Tunisia and Ukraine), 13 reported to be undergoing health sector needs definition (Barbados, Cote d'Ivoire, Dominica, Egypt, France, Kazakhstan, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Peru, Philippines, Senegal, Swedish, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and South Africa), 7 reported to be co-designing climate products with the health sector (Belgium, Finland, Georgia, Hungary, Niger, Singapore and United Republic of Tanzania), 14 reported that tailored products are accessible to the health sector(Antigua and Barbuda, China, Cameroon, Spain, Fiji, Croatia, Kenya, Latvia, Morocco, Mali, Russia, El Salvador, Serbia, Trinidad and Tobago), and 3 reported that climate services are guiding health sector's policy decisions and investments plans (Austria, Indonesia, United States of America). The current data source from WMO only considers climate services provided by NMS. It is unclear the degree to which other providers, such as academic	1
institutions and research projects, private sector products, products from other Ministries, or regional and global products and services are being used, in proportion to services made available by NMS. The open questionnaire can be updated at any time by WMO members, therefore the figures here reported may change over the year. As each country may update their profile information at different moments in time, snap shots do not reflect progress for any given year but rather information provided until a certain date. The current questionnaire does not record the number of WMO members that do not provide climate services to the health sector. The questionnaire captures information on the provision of climate services, the status of service provision to the health sector (divided in 5 categories) and the type of services provided (divided in 5 categories as well). However, only the provision and status of climate service has been reported here due to uncertainties over the quality of the data on the type of services provided. Questions do not capture the source or quality of the service and only one of the answer option covers the utility of the climate services. They do not capture whether data originates from national meteorological observations or is resulting from regional or global products. They do not capture the potential use of all-sector forecasts or outlooks which are accessed and used by the health sector. The WMO and WHO have some differences in their individual Member States. Responses collected from WMO Member States, were reclassified according to WHO Region. WMO members that are not individual WHO members were excluded from the analyses and include Macao and Hong Kong (reported as China), Curacao and St. Maartens. The following WHO Members are not Members of WMO, therefore representative data is not available: Andorra, Equatorial Guinea, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, San Marino. Future Form of Indicator	1
The WMO Country Profile Database Integrated questionnaire is expected to be improved to capture binary yes/no responses, reflecting affirmative nonprovision of climate services. This will allow comparison with the 2017 baseline indicator, citing the rate of climate service provision to the health sector among respondents. Future versions are likely to provide greater insight on the status of climate service provision for the health sector, and the type of service provided.. Other complementary WMO surveys capturing specific product types, user satisfaction, and application areas, may be publically available in the future to inform future editions of this indicator. The World Health Organization (WHO) conducts a regular climate and health country survey with ministries of health or national health authorities in its 194 Member States. In 2017, this survey added indicators on the inclusion of meteorological information in integrated risk monitoring and early warning systems for climate-sensitive diseases. The 2017 WHO climate and health survey findings are expected to be reported in the 2019 Lancet report and may be used to improve this indicator.	1
2. Adaptation, planning and resilience for health 2.6 National assessments of climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation for health Similar to the methods provided for indicator 2.1, national assessments of vulnerability, impacts and adaptation for health (health V&As) were monitored through the 2015 WHO Climate and Health Country Survey. A subset of 34 existing health V&As were collected either through the WHO Climate and Health Country Survey or through WHO-assisted country and regional projects. These countries include: Albania, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Malta, Mongolia, Morocco, Nepal, Russia, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Zambia. As mentioned for indicator 2.1, since the WHO Climate and Health Country Survey findings will only be updated every two years, the interim information provided in this report focuses on a qualitative analysis of the available national health V&As in order to gain insight into key questions regarding the development and content of these documents. It should be noted that the aim of this review was to collect the most recent and available documents and therefore, the national assessments included do not necessarily correspond directly to those reported on in the 2017 Lancet Countdown Report. The focus of this qualitative analysis was to evaluate available national health V&As considering the following key questions: * The geographic coverage of the assessment (national or subnational); * The prioritized climate-sensitive health outcomes; * Prioritized health outcomes; quantitative or qualitative sensitivity analysis towards climate change and variability; quantitative or qualitative projections of future disease burden; and description of the most vulnerable populations; * Whether the adaptive capacity of the health sector was evaluated; The adaptation options outlined and an assessment of the linkages between adaptation needs and measures identified. Collection of national assessments of vulnerability, impacts and adaptation for health were based on voluntary submission through the 2015 WHO Climate and Health Country Survey combined with outreach to ministry of health and national health authority focal points through WHO country and regional offices to request the most recent and publicly available documents. The collected national health V&As do not represent an exhaustive search of all national scientific assessments for health vulnerability to climate change for all WHO Member States and new documents or revised documents may be available at the time of publication. As such, the results of this evaluation should be considered indicative not conclusive. In addition, some of the documents included were not strictly vulnerability and adaptation assessments (nine included only vulnerability or adaptation in their titles, and six were entitled in other ways, e.g. Climate Change and Health) hence the scope and structure were not perfectly	1
aligned with that of a health V&A. Nonetheless, the evaluation provided valuable insight on some of the aspects included in a health V&A assessment. The WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will be conducted biennially and will continue to be the primary source of data to track this indicator. This indicator will be updated biennially as new data from the survey is published. The goal over the long-term is to gather data from all WHO member States, however as the coverage of the survey will expand over time, the next update of data from the 2017/2018 WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will aim to provide data on approximately 80 WHO Member States. Interim information regarding the specific content of national assessments of vulnerability, impacts and adaptation for health, as explored in this qualitative analysis, may be re-assessed in the future.	1
2. Adaptation, planning and resilience for health 2.7 Spending on adaptation for health and health-related activities The `Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change' dataset is the same data source that used in the previous Lancet Countdown report. It measures spending on economic activities related to adaptation and resilience to climate change. It was developed by data research firm kMatrix in partnership with numerous stakeholders, and includes the key adaptation measures identified by the IPCC. This classification of adaptation activities was originally developed from attempts by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to measure adaptation in 2009/2010. The definition of adaptation activities was extended through collaboration with the Greater London Authority in 2014, and updated through a project with Climate-KIC in 2017. This added several new industrial sectors as well as significantly expanding the activities under health and healthcare. The methodology used for data acquisition and analysis is based on a system called as `profiling', which was originally developed at Harvard Business School to track and analyse technical and industrial change. This is the basis for building taxonomies of economic activities and value chains, which can then be populated with estimates of key economic metrics like sales value and employment by triangulating transactional and operational business data to estimate economic values. This methodology is particularly valuable in areas where government statistics and standard industry classifications are not available. When measuring an industry or sector, the new taxonomy is populated from the bottom up, searching for evidence for the ideal definition and including only economic activities where sufficient evidence is available. For each transaction listed in the adaptation economy data, a minimum of seven separate sources must independently record the transaction for it to be confirmed and included in the database. Triangulating data from multiple sources permits large volumes of unsorted, fragmented data of different types from different sources to be processed to arrive at more accurate estimates of transactional value that would not be possible using a single source. For the adaptation economy, data are produced to a confidence level of around 80%. Accessing and analysing multiple types of data is also key to identifying the `purpose' behind an economic activity, which is key for accurately assigning economic activities to the adaptation dataset.	1
Developing the new definition of adaptation and resilience to climate change involved the top-down taxonomy of the entire make and mend' economy, and then adaptation and resilience in all forms. Then these categories were filtered to isolate economic activities that can be strictly identified as being relevant to adaptation and resilience to climate change. The taxonomy of A&RCC is drawn from 11 sectors of the economy at-large: Agriculture & Forestry, Built Environment, Disaster Preparedness, Energy, Health/Health Care, ICT, Natural Environment, Professional Services, Transport, Waste and Water. There are a number of activities across different sectors that are `health-related' in the adaptation and resilience to climate change dataset, outside of the strictlydefined healthcare sector. The indicator design therefore required the definition of those activities from the other 10 sectors of the A&RCC data that can be clearly related to health, and thus should be included in a definition of `health-related' adaptation spending. The robust interim approach used for last year's Lancet Countdown was again adopted for this year's Lancet Countdown. The 'healthrelated' activities consists of the activities of the Healthcare/Health Sector, Disaster Preparedness and Agriculture adaptation activities from the kMatrix dataset. A methodology is under development to define a full health-related adaptation definition across the entire A&RCC dataset. Geographical Coverage	1
The A&RCC dataset has global coverage for 226 countries and territories. Data has been reported for a subset of countries and territories for whom adaptation spending data, regional and income classifications, and population estimates are available. This year's indicator covers 188 countries and territories with data reported in the A&RCC dataset, and that are assigned a region in the WHO regional classification and an income group in the World Bank income group classification. Per Capita values are based on 183 countries that also have population estimates from the IMF World Economic Outlook. Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change dataset: kMatrix Ltd, in partnership with University College London Comparison Data: The classification of WHO Regions was taken from the WHO Data Repository Metadata. WHO metadata reports the World Bank Income Grouping values from 2016 (released July 2016, based on 2015 calendar year data). Therefore, World Bank income groups have been taken from the Bank's June 2017 update, which was based on 2016 calendar year data. 2016 and 2017 Population and GDP estimates from the April 2018 update of the IMF World Economic Outlook were used to calculate a fiscal year values for 2016/17. For comparability, global total values present the global total for countries or territories that are included in the regional and world bank analysis - it does not include the 38 countries and territories which have neither a WHO Region nor a World Bank Income Group. Most of these are overseas territories or sub-national jurisdictions with relatively lower levels of adaptation spending. However, several	1
Data in this year's indicator covers 188 countries and territories that have data reported in the A&RCC dataset, and that are assigned a region in the WHO regional classification and an income group in the World Bank income and lending groups (Per Capita values are based on 183 countries with population estimates from the IMF World Economic Outlook). Economic activity or transactions are only measured where there is an economic `footprint', i.e. where there is transactional/financial data available to be measured. Therefore, public sector spending without an economic `footprint' (government spending on salaries, for example), cannot be measured. It also not possible to directly identify what percentage of measured spending is public versus private. Values are not currently adjusted for inflation. Values of sales generated are not directly comparable with values derived from national statistics. The reference period is the financial years 2015/16 and 2016/17. Further historical data is likely to be available in the future.	1
There will be three major developments in the future form of the indicator. The first will be the development of the `three-tier' definition of; 1) adaptation activities with direct, important health impacts 2) those with less direct or more minor health impacts 3) those with no health impact or too tenuous a health impact. Secondly, in the future it is likely to possible to present historical data for the indicator, in order to provide trend data on change in spend over time. Finally, in the future the aim is to develop an indicator of adaptation spending as a percentage of the overall health sector spend and health-related spend as a percentage of the entire economy (represented by 24 industries), compiled using transactional data.	1
2. Adaptation, planning and resilience for health 2.8 Health adaptation funding from global climate financing mechanisms This indicator used the Climate Funds Update (CFU  20data on total gross flows of all multilaterally governed funds focused on climate change from January 1 2003 to December 31 2017. The data also includes funds from bilateral organisations, but excludes funding from bilateral to multinational organisations, to avoid double counting of funds. For this indicator, the CFU data selected was for adaptation only and the "approved funding" figure was used to calculate adaptation funding. To calculate the adaptation funding that has been allocated to health, the following sectors were selected: "basic health", "health" and "health, general". Although it is recognised that other adaptation measures can have important health co-benefits, drawing out how effectively adaptation projects benefitted and accounted for health is complex and developing a consistent methodology for doing so would require more resource. Therefore, only those projects earmarked specifically as health were included in the analysis here.	1
Climate Funds Update Some of the data was incomplete and so those adaptation projects that did not have the year noted could not be included, as it would then not be possible to accurately show the annual funding for adaptation and health adaptation, or changes in funding over time. To counter this, project documents were searched for and, where available, the project approval date updated in the CFU data. However, this was not possible for all projects. Furthermore, these results show funding through global climate financing mechanisms only and do not show the additional funding support given to these adaptation projects (for example, from UN agencies or national governments). The funding mechanisms included in the CFU data are shown in Web Table 1. Climate funding from Canada, the US, Japan and Denmark is not included in the CFU data; as such the figures presented here are likely to be underestimates. Additionally, the data presented in Figure 1 is not cumulative. Although most projects run for more than one year, there was insufficient information in the CFU data detailing the allocated spending for each project year and so only the total approved adaptation funding in each given year was shown. In future, this indicator could show all funding streams that fund adaptation generally and health adaptation specifically. The contributions of different funding streams could then be analysed and new funding streams (such as national governments) shown.	1
Average (from 2000-2015) deaths per 1000 capita for floods, droughts and storms related disasters for low, medium low, medium high and high categories of % GDP spent on capital health expenditure; where categories represent quartiles of % GDP spent on capital health expenditure. Outliers not shown, are Myanmar (2.82) in the low category; Dominica (0.45) in the medium low category; Haiti (0.71) in the medium high category; and, Bhutan (0.31) and Niue (0.59) in the high category.	1
3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.1: Carbon intensity of the energy system Technical definition is the tonnes of CO emitted for each unit (TJ) of primary energy supplied. The rationale for the indicator choice is that carbon intensity of the energy system will provide information on the level of fossil fuel use, which has associated air pollution impacts. Higher intensity values indicate a more fossil dominated system, and one that is likely to have a higher coal share. As countries pursue climate mitigation goals, the carbon intensity is likely to reduce with benefits for air pollution. The indicator is calculated based on total CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion divided by Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES). TPES reflects the total amount of primary energy used in a specific country, accounting for the flow of energy imports and exports.	1
The data are available for most countries of the world, for the period 19712015. This indicator is based on based on the International Energy Agency (2017) dataset CO2 Emissions From Fuel Combustion: CO2 Indicators, via the UK data service ( The indicator does not provide information on the share of different fossil fuels, their use in different sectors, and the absolute levels of usage. These are all important elements in understanding the air pollution emissions, and their impacts. Therefore, additional indicators (3.2 & 3.3) provide additional complimentary information. This indicator will need to be updated to provide the data for the most recent years, which have seen important shifts in the use of fossil fuels, particularly coal.	1
3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.2. Coal phase-out Two indicators are used here; i) Total primary coal supply by region / country (in EJ units), and ii) Share of electricity generation from coal (% of total generation from coal). These indicators are important to enable tracking of change in coal consumption at a regional and country level. Due to the level of coal used for power generation, a second indicator tracks the contribution to electricity generation from coal power plants in selected countries. As countries pursue climate mitigation goals, the use of coal is likely to reduce with resulting benefits for air pollution. The indicator on primary energy coal supply is an aggregation of all coal types used across all sectors (from the IEA energy balances). The indicator on the share of	1
The data are available for most countries of the world, for the period 1971-2015. Only the period from 1990 has been used, due to data gaps for selected countries prior to 1990. Countries or regions with large levels of coal use (as a share of generation, or in absolute terms), have been selected. This indicator is based on based on the extended energy balances from the International Energy Agency (2017). The specific dataset is called World Extended Energy Balances, and is sourced via the UK data service ( These indicators provides a proxy for air quality emissions associated with the combustion of coal. Further work is required to convert coal use by sector and type into emissions of different air quality pollutants. In the future, this indicator set could be developed to also estimate the actual air pollutant emissions associated with coal use. This will require sectoral use, coal type (both of which are available) and appropriate emission factors. As per 3.1, this indicator will need to be updated to provide the data for the most recent years, which have seen important shifts in the use of coal.	1

3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.3. Zero-carbon emission electricity Two indicators are used here, and presented in two ways; i) Total low carbon electricity generation, in absolute terms (TWh) and as a % share of total electricity generated (to include nuclear, and all renewables), and ii) Total renewable generation (excluding hydro), in TWh, and as a % share of total electricity generated.	1
The increase in the use of low carbon and renewable energy for electricity generation will push other fossil fuels, such as coal, out of the mix over time, resulting in an improvement in air quality, with benefits to health. The renewables (excluding hydro) indicator has been used to allow for the tracking of rapidly emergent renewable technologies. For both indicators, generation, rather than capacity, has been chosen as a metric as the electricity generated from these technologies is what actually displaces fossil-based generation. Countries with large levels of low carbon generation (as shares, or in absolute terms), or with higher fossil dependency, have been selected. The data are again taken from the IEA extended energy balances. The absolute level indicators are total gross electricity generated aggregated from the relevant technology types. The share indicators are estimated as the low carbon or renewable generation as a % of total generation.	1
The data are available for most countries of the world, for the period 19712015. Only the period from 1990 has been used, due to data gaps for selected countries prior to 1990. This indicator is based on based on the extended energy balances from the IEA. The specific dataset is called World Extended Energy Balances, and is sourced via the UK data service ( This indicator set does not provide information on the air pollutant emissions displaced due to the increasing share of RE generation. This set should be developed to include an indicator to assess the direct impact on air quality emissions from additional low carbon generation, one approach being to compare the emission intensity of the current system with a counterfactual case, which does not have the additional share of RE generation.	1
3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.4. Access to clean energy The 2017 report used the SDG 7.1.2, which is: "The proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology is calculated as the number of people using clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting divided by total population reporting that any cooking, heating or lighting, expressed as percentage. "Clean" is defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion." As defined by the SDG Metadata:  The SDG indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO. Estimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban and rural population for a	1
In the 2018 report, as no update to the SDG indicator has been provided, further information around the access and use of energy in the household sector has been shown. The use of energy in the residential sector is drawn from the IEA extended global. This SDG indicator is based on data from the UN SDG database:	1
The indicator is based on the main type of fuel and technology used for cooking as cooking occupies the largest share of overall household energy needs. However, this will not reflect household fuel use activities when multiple fuels are used through the day or year. There is also a lack of data on the type of fuel and technologies used for home heating and lighting.	1
The data from the IEA on residential energy flows and energy access provide an indication of both the access to electricity and the proportion of the different types of energy used within the residential sector. These provide an important picture on how access and use might be interacting. An ideal indicator going forward be further details on the fuel mix used by households for different demands (heating, cooling, cooking, hot water, lighting and other plug loads) for a range of income groupings within the country. The pressures of interest are the GHG and air pollution emissions that contribute to climate change and health outcomes, but also the increased access to energy use, which has broader socio-economic benefits.	1

Interlinkages between energy systems the SDGs and targets. Green shows synergies. For targets highlighted green (and indicated with green lines), we identified published evidence of synergies with decisions in pursuit of SDG7. c, For targets highlighted orange (and indicated with orange lines), we identified published evidence of trade-offs with decisions in pursuit of SDG7. In b and c, the absence of highlighting indicates the absence of identified evidence. This does not necessarily indicate the absence of a synergy or trade-off between the relevant target and SDG7 Targets. (Source: Fuso-Nerini et al., 2018) Working group	1
DIMAQ incorporates data from multiple sources in order to provide estimates of exposures to PM2.5 at high spatial resolution (0.1x0.1) globally. The model has been further developed to account for time in the calibration of satellite with ground measurements. Sources of data include: ground measurements from more than 6,000 monitoring locations in some 3,000 cities around the world, satellite remote sensing; population estimates; topography; and information on local monitoring networks and measures of specific contributors of air pollution from chemical transport models The DIMAQ model calibrates data from these sources with ground measurements. The relationships between the various sources of data may be complex and will vary between regions due to differences in the composition of PM2.5 and other factors. DIMAQ has a hierarchical structure	1
within which calibration equations are produced for individual countries using, as a priority, data from that country where available. Where data within a country is insufficient to produce accurate estimates, it is supplemented with regional information. The cities included in this indicator are 308 (out of a total of 309) globallyrepresentative cities from the Sustainable Healthy Urban Environments (SHUE) database for which an air pollution estimate was obtained from DIMAQ, extracted for the 0.1x0.1 grid square containing the city's central coordinates. The data represent median estimates for each SHUE city. SHUE is an initiative, funded by the Wellcome Trust, to support policy development in areas relating to environmental and health challenges and opportunities in cities. It aims to test the feasibility and methods of assembling data about the characteristics of a globally distributed sample of cities, and the populations within them, for comparative analyses, and to use such data to assess how policies may contribute to sustainable urban development and human health.	1
Indicator covers urban areas (SHUE cities) only. The model grid size is 10x10 km close to the equator but larger near the poles. Model estimates for data-poor countries may be relatively imprecise. No representation of within-city variability in air pollution.	1
In the 2017 report, indicator 3.5.1 was based on data from the WHO's Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database (2016 update), the latest version of which was released in May 2018. This was too late for inclusion in this year's report. An ideal indicator would provide a marker of benefits for air quality and/or health that are directly attributable to climate change mitigation action (the present indicator represents only the levels of air pollution to which urban populations are exposed).	1
This indicator quantifies contributions of individual source sectors to ambient PM2.5 exposure and its health impacts. This year, coal has been highlighted as a fuel across all sectors.	1
Estimates of sectoral source contributions to annual mean exposure to ambient PM2.5 were calculated using the GAINS model (Amann et al., 2011), which combines bottom-up emission calculations with atmospheric chemistry and dispersion coefficients.	1
Energy statistics are taken from the IEA World Energy Outlook 2017 (IEA, 2017), merged with GAINS information on application of emission control technologies and their emission factors. Atmospheric transfer coefficients are based on full year simulations with the EMEP Chemistry Transport Model (Simpson et al. 2012) at 0.5x0.5 resolution using meteorology of 2015 and include a downscaling to capture sub-grid urban concentration gradients. Calculated ambient PM2.5 concentrations have been validated against in-situ observations from the latest version of the WHO's Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database (2016 update), and other sources where available (e.g. Chinese statistical yearbook). Premature deaths from total ambient PM2.5 for regions other than Europe are calculated using the methodology of the WHO (2016) assessment on the burden of disease from ambient air pollution, which relies on disease specific integrated exposure response relationships (IERs) developed within the Global Burden of Disease 2013 study (Forouzanfar et al., 2015). Disease and age specific baseline mortality rates are taken from the GBD Results database ( For Europe, we follow the WHO Europe methodology and apply dose-response relationships for all cause mortality among population over 30 years of age as reported under the REVIHAAP assessment (WHO, 2013). Details are described in Kiesewetter et al. (2015). Attribution of estimated premature deaths from AAP to polluting sectors was done proportional to the contributions of individual sectors to population-weighted mean PM2.5 in each country. Caveats	1
The indicator relies on model calculations which are currently available for a limited set of countries (Europe, South Asia, East Asia) uncertainty in the shape of integrated exposure-response relationships (IERs) make the quantification of health burden inherently uncertain Different dose-response relationships are used for Europe (REVIHAAP, recommended by WHO-Europe) and Asia (WHO-Global) The non-linearity of the IERs used for Asia complicates the translation between the mortality burden attributed to an individual source, which is calculated proportional to the source contribution to ambient PM2.5, and the effect of mitigating this source. While a reduction of emissions would lead to a (roughly) proportional reduction of ambient PM2.5, this would not necessarily result in a proportional reduction of the health burden. In highly polluted environments, the health benefits of a marginal reduction of emissions would be disproportionately smaller than the relative change in concentrations.	1
The spatial coverage is currently being expanded to global coverage. Other health indicators than premature deaths should be included for a more complete assessment of the health burden, particularly Years of Life Lost (YLLs) and Years Lived with Disability (YLDs). An ideal indicator would provide a marker of benefits for air quality and/or health that are directly attributable to climate change mitigation action,	1

3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.6. Clean fuel use for transport Fuel use data (by fuel type) from the IEA datasets are divided by corresponding population statistics from the World Bank. This indicator is based on data from the International Energy Agency (2016), Global EB Outlook 2016: Beyond one million electric cars This indicator does not explicitly quantify the impact associated with transitioning to transport fuels that are less polluting, though it does provide trends that can be used as a proxy. It also cannot, at this time, be disaggregated to the urban level. An ideal indicator would capture the direct health impacts of the use of transport fuels, with country- and urban-level specificity within the global coverage. In turn, the co-benefits of transitioning to less-polluting fuels would be quantified directly in terms of reduced exposures to air pollution and their corresponding health impact.	1
The data for this indicator were obtained by searching for freely-available travel survey data for selected cities. The cities included were those from the Sustainable Healthy Urban Environments (SHUE) database (see description of indicator 3.5.1 for further details). Data was identified for 92 cities, of which 48 had data on cycling collected over the past decade (i.e., 2008-2018), from the following sources (grouped by WHO region): Europe Berlin: Stahlberg SG.

Data on city-level GDP for SHUE cities were compiled from various sources, including the Brookings Institute, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and World Bank. Where city-level data was unavailable, regional or national data was used. Caveats	1
Survey data for some cities is up to 10 years old and may not represent current conditions. The indicator presents data on only 48 cities, i.e., one fifth of the cities in SHUE data base. Data for some cities is likely to be of poor quality (particularly in low income settings). Data may not be comparable due to differences in data quality, methods of data collection, and purpose of survey. Some parts of the world are under-represented (especially Africa, South and South-East Asia, and the Middle East).	1
The data currently included in this indicator come from an initial scoping of available data. An ideal indicator would include data from a systematic search of travel data in all selected cities and countries. This may involve contacting survey teams in different countries to provide estimates or access to the desired data. To more fully capture sustainable uptake a future indicator could collate data on the proportion of total distance travelled made by different modes of transport. Other data on sustainable travel infrastructure, for instance, the presence of cycle schemes would be useful.	1

income countries, rather than from low-middle income, where the livelihoods and resilience of millions of households are dependent on livestock, and the livestock production systems are quite different. (For example, in many arid, pastoralist systems there is no viable agricultural alternative to keeping livestock.) Although we used the amount and proportion of energy from ruminant meat as a proxy indicator for food groups with some of the highest levels of GHG emissions, it is important to note that emissions are also high for other food groups, especially from other meat and dairy products. The graphs below show the proportion of energy available from animal products and the proportion of protein available from animal products. The proportion of energy available from animal products is highest in the Americas, where trends suggest a slight increase, and Europe, where trends suggest a slight decrease. Proportions are notably low in South East Asia. Trends suggest proportion of energy from animal products is increasing most rapidly in the Western Pacific with slower increases apparent in the Eastern Mediterranean and South East Asia. The proportion of protein available from animal products follows similar trends to the proportion of energy from animal products: highest in the Americas and Europe, lowest in South East Asia, and growing most rapidly in the Western Pacific. These measures on animal product availability may be useful for tracking progress on shifting away from animal intensive products to more a more plant based diets. However, since the evidence relating consumption of non-red meat and dairy products to adverse health outcomes is currently less clear than for consumption of red meat, we did not include any measure of animal product availability in the core indicators.	1
A comprehensive view of sustainability of livestock production systems in both developed and developing context is needed, to ensure indicators are equitable. Tracking progress towards more sustainable diets requires standardised and continuous data on food consumption and related GHG emissions throughout food product life cycles. This would require annual nationally representative detailed dietary survey data on food consumption. However, due to the complexity and cost of such data collection, dietary surveys are available for a limited number of countries and years only. Efforts to compile data and ensure comparability are underway, but their current format is not suitable for global monitoring of progress towards optimal dietary patterns. On the other hand, nearly 800 million suffer from hunger while 2 billion people are overweight or obese, and while part of the world overconsumes livestock-derived foods, the poorest populations consume hardly any. In this indicator we look at the proportion of energy from meat, but excessive energy consumption needs to be reduced for good health. Other nutrient requirements need to be met through diverse diets, including a wide range of food groups, including nutrient-rich foods such as fruits and vegetables and animal-source foods. These requirements vary substantially during the life-cycle and are particularly high in growing young children and pregnant and lactating women. For this reason, targeting consumption and redistribution rather than promoting generalized reduction seems a more rational approach.	1
Data from the UK comes from published reports from the Sustainable Development Unit (NHS, 2016). Estimates of GHG emissions include emissions from building energy use, travel to and from sites, and goods and services purchased from the health care sector. Data from the US comes from an article by Eckelman & Sherman (2016). Estimates are modelled using data on health care expenditures. Data from Australia comes from a published report from the Department of Health in Victoria (Malik et al.2018). Estimates take into account GHG associated with products and food purchased by one municipality (Southern Health), waste, and transportation. To extrapolate to the whole Victorian Health system estimates from Southern Health were scaled up to all of Victoria using separations (as a measure of activity) and floor area (Malik et al, 2018).	1
All sources of data have notable limitations. Estimates from each country use different calculation methods and include different elements, limiting comparability. In the UK, there have been changes in the method of estimating emissions over time. Finally, the indicator does not adjust for the size (or changes in the size) of the health care system.	1
A future set of indicators would reflect country-wide GHG emissions of health care systems with denominators of the system size and volume of health care service provision. Indicators should be available at each level of policy and managerial decision-making to inform choices and facilitate selection of policies and organizational operations with lowest GHG emission levels. Additionally, efficiency of health care system performance in relation to climate change can be evaluated by modelling global health risks attributed to the GHG emissions of each health care system as a proportion of their contribution to the health of the population. Mitigation strategies could be designed in collaboration with relevant sectors, such as the insurance sector or health care commissioners and providers.	1
Key macro-scale factors driving processes that lead to GHG emissions and consequences for human health, i.e., root causes of the problems Factors determining the extent to which driving forces are translated into pressures Rate of specific activities (often part of production, consumption), which exert unfavourable pressure on natural social and human environment Intensity of the pressure exerted by specific activities and permeability of the environmental media to these pressures Extent to which the atmosphere, natural social and human environment (e.g., infrastructure) and behaviour, are changed as a result of the exerted pressures	1
4. Economics and finance 4.1 Economic Losses due to Climate-Related Events Munch Re NatCatSERVICE provided the data for this indicator. The NatCatSERVICE is a global database of natural catastrophe data. Munich Re has been systematically recording information on natural catastrophe loss events from around the world since 1994. This has developed into one of the world's most comprehensive databases for information on natural catastrophe loss events. Data suitable for systematic and analytical evaluation on a worldwide scale are available from 1980 onwards. For this paper, data from 1990 are presented in order to align with the base year against which GHG emission reduction targets are commonly set. NatCatSERVICE collect a range of information for around 1,200 events each year. For this paper only data on direct economic loss (physical/tangible losses, expressed in US$2017), insured losses (all paid-out insured physical/tangible losses) are used. Please refer to the online NatCatSERVICE Methodology document, which may be found online ( The Table below illustrates the `peril classification' provided by NatCatSERVICE. Perils classified as Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological have been included in the analysis. Geophysical perils are excluded, due to their general independence from climate change. Family	1

Each natural catastrophe event recorded is assigned a direct economic loss, and where applicable, an insured loss, expressed in nominal US$ values. Where these are available, data are taken from official institutions, but where not, estimates are calculated. The process for estimation depends on what data is available. For example, if loss estimates from insurance market data is available, this data may be combined with data on insurance penetration and other event-specific information to estimate total economic losses. If only low-quality information is available, such as a description of the number of homes damaged or destroyed, assumptions on value and costs are made. Loss values are presented in US$, or if initially expressed in local currency, converted to US$ using the market exchange rates at the end of the month when the event occurred. Values for 1990-2016 are converted to US$2016 using country-specific Consumer Price Indices (CPI), and then inflated to US$2017. Once data was received from the NatCatSERVICE economic losses (insured and uninsured) were divided by annual GDP values for each income grouping, sourced from the World Bank Database and inflated to US$2017 using data sourced from the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis. In Watts et al (2017), 2016 GDP data was estimated. For this report, this has been replaced by reported data. Data The data below differs from that reported in Watts et al (2017), as monetary values have been updated to US$2017, actual rather than estimated GDP data for 2016 is now used, and absolute losses and fatality data are not reported.

gas), or to divest from all fossil fuel companies (coal, oil, natural gas), but only in specific asset classes (e.g. direct investments, domestic equity). - `Coal and Tar Sands' - An institution or corporation that made a binding commitment to divest (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual funds containing shares, corporate bonds) from any coal and tar sands companies. - `Coal only' - An institution or corporation that made a binding commitment to divest (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual funds containing shares, corporate bonds) from any coal companies. Four organisations that were originally recorded as non-healthcare institutions have been considered as such for the purpose of this indicator (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, SSM Health, HESTA and HCF). In addition, the Health Alliance on Climate Change has been removed from the data (as no explicit divestment commitment has been made). Data	1
Due to confidentiality issues, the full dataset is not available for publication. However, interested readers may visit the 350.org website for further information. See `Methods'. The ideal future form of this indicator would have two elements. The first element would track the value of institutional investments in fossil fuels assets, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of their total portfolios. This would also allow for tracking of associated funds that are moved out of fossil fuels, but are not explicitly advertised as `divesting'. However, such data is unlikely to be available. The second element of this indicator would more explicitly track the value of funds divested from fossil fuels by healthcare institutions. The data provided for the indicator in this paper may be improved upon through, for example, the issuance of annual surveys either as part of other data collection efforts from healthcare institutions, or independently.	1
4. Economics and finance 4.6 - Fossil fuel subsidies The data for this indicator are taken from the International Energy Agency (IEA), and is calculated using the price-gap approach, for 42 mostly non-OECD countries (see data below). The `price-gap' approach is the most commonly applied methodology for quantifying consumption subsidies. It compares average end-user prices paid by consumers with reference prices that correspond to the full cost of supply. The price gap is the amount by which an end-use price falls short of the reference price and its existence indicates the presence of a subsidy. Prices are converted to US2017 using data sourced from the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis. To view the original data (presented in US$ 2016), please see IEA (2018)vi Data are presented in US$2017 billion.

Instrument coverage of GHG emissions, in both absolute and proportional term, are based on total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2012 - the last year in which consistent data was available. `Baseline and Credit' instruments are not included due to a lack of price data. Some instruments experience an overlap in coverage. For example, the UK Carbon Price Floor applies to the power sector in the UK, which is also subject to carbon pricing under the EU ETS. Other instruments experience partial overlap. As such, total emissions coverage is likely to be overestimated (ceteris paribus), although this effect is likely to be minor (<2.5% total coverage). The price used to calculate the weighted average prices are the	1
prevailing prices on a single day. The prices for many instruments (particularly ETS instruments) are likely to alter over the course of a year, however the effect on the final summary values is likely to be minor. Prices are presented in current values. See Indicator 4.6. - Fossil Fuel Subsidies - for comments as to how this indicator could be developed.	1
4. Economics and finance 4.8 - Use of carbon pricing revenues Data on revenue generated is provided by the World Bank's interactive `Carbon Pricing Dashboard'.x The method of revenue expenditure classification is adapted from Carl and Fedor (2016)xi. Definitions and assumptions regarding the categories as applied in this paper are as follows:	1
Climate Change Mitigation - revenues are explicitly allocated to activities or infrastructure that seeks to reduce, or enable the reduction, of greenhouse gas emissions, from any source, within or outside of the sectors or jurisdiction in which the carbon price is applied. Climate Change Adaptation - as above, but for adaptation activities or infrastructure. Revenue Recycling - revenues are explicitly returned to some broad portion of the population through individual or business tax rate cuts, tax eliminations, or rebates in order to achieve broad revenue neutrality. Revenue returned to directly compensate for the cost of GHG emissions (through free permit allocation or targeted assistance for energy-intensive, trade-exposed firms) are not included). General Funds - revenues are explicitly used for purposes other than those described above, or the use of revenues is unspecified or information is unavailable. Only revenue that may be considered government income is included. For example, revenue generated by sale of permits issued to utilities under the Californian cap and trade instrument, which much then be used to finance discounts on household energy bills through `carbon credits', are not considered, as this revenue does not pass through the State government. Instruments for which price data is not available, either due to the type of instrument or simply lack of data, are not included. Other assumptions as applied to individual instruments are described below. Revenue Allocation (US$2017 million)	1
5. Public and political engagement 5.1 Media coverage of health and climate change Global newspaper reporting on health and climate change Coverage of climate change and public health tracks consistently with several trends in media coverage of climate change or global warming, where political, scientific, cultural and ecological/meteorological themes provide news hooks for stories over time. For example, the increase in coverage in late 2009 is associated with news regarding the United Nations Conference of Parties climate change negotiations. Media serve as critical inputs for public discourse on contemporary climate challenges. Consequently, it is important to conduct methodologically consistent and high-quality monitoring and aggregation of media treatments to help understand public discourse on climate change and health over the past eleven years. Through this monitoring, we have found that there is room for further increases in the quantity of public health and climate change media coverage in various WHO regions. Going forward, it would be of interest to conduct further research to understand why coverage of climate change and health is significantly higher in SE Asia than in other regions. This could, in turn, foster ongoing and vital discussions of these links for everyday people around the world. The 2018 work here expanded analyses through 2017 and added forty-four sources. In 2018, we monitored climate change coverage across sixty-two sources (in English, Spanish, Portuguese and German) in thirty-six countries covering regions around the world over an eleven-year period, from January 2007 through December 2017. Therefore, this work provides a more robust assessment of climate change/global warming and public health indicators than before. These sources have been selected through a decision processes involving weighting of four main factors: (1) geographical diversity (favouring a greater geographical range), (2) circulation (favouring higher circulating publications), (3) national sources (rather than local/regional), and (4) reliable access to archives over time (favouring those accessible consistently for longer periods). While this improved methodology does provide a more robust sample of sources, due to the change in methodologies across 2017 and 2018, it is not possible to compare these analyses in real terms. However, it remains possible to examine relative trends.

Findings from these searches must be interpreted with some caution. Prominently, with this extensive Boolean string, there are some returns that do not centrally address climate change and health together. For example, the search term "temperature" often generates a hit, but articles may be addressing a fever related to some illness, rather than climate change or global warming. As another example, there may be some overlap between articles discussing climate change legislation and health care legislation respectively without meaningfully linking climate change and health. Also, in working with newspapers, rather than, for example, UN communications/documents, a narrower or more tailored approach might more effectively reduce the possibilities for false positives in the dataset. While we find that these shortcomings garner some caution, we do not	1
think that they are significant enough to need changes and we find this to be the most effective approach given the tools available.

5: Public and political engagement 5.1.2: In-depth analysis of newspaper coverage on health and climate change In 2018, this indicator analyses the trends in media coverage of the climate change and health nexus, in three selected national newspapers, from January 2009 to December 2017. Although some tabloids have a broader readership, Le Monde, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and The New York Times continue to set the tone of public debates, and therefore are a good prism through which the perceptions of these issues in society can be analysed. In order to not only find articles which would give valuable information about the topic of climate and health but also to evaluate this information most efficiently, we used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Articles from the newspapers were searched in online search databases (Le Monde, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung) and in Factiva (The New York Times) using specific search syntax to track the number of articles on climate change and health each year. Articles were then screened, identified and categorized according to specified criteria (type of article, author's profession, type of source, tone of the article, studied health impact, geographical focus, context, recommendation, targeted audience). In the work for the 2017 publication, analysis had already been completed for two of the newspapers, Le Monde and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, for the time period 2007-2016. For the 2018 Countdown report, we have expanded the time period to 2007-2017 and, in addition, added a third newspaper, The New York Times, to our analysis. This addition is in recognition of the relevance of the USA to the global climate change picture (recent withdrawal of the USA from the Paris Agreement, major contribution to GHG emissions globally and frequency of extreme climatic event such as wildfires and hurricanes). In addition, for the 2018 Countdown report, we provide a comparison of two trends: the media coverage of "health and climate change", using our specific search syntax and screening process, and the media coverage of "climate change", without screening process. This allowed us to calculate a ratio of articles mentioning the link with health among articles about climate change. We provide the following table to show how we adapted the French & German search terms used for the 2017 report to English:	1
For consistency and feasibility reasons, we maintained approximately the same search terms in the 2018 Countdown report as we used for the 2017 publication. We did not find any significant problems with them. That said, findings from these searches had to be screened carefully. Prominently, with this extensive Boolean string, there were some returns that did not centrally address climate change and health together (false positives). For example, there may be some overlap between articles discussing climate change legislation and health care legislation respectively without meaningfully linking climate change and health. We tackled this issue by a high-quality screening of all positive results, in order to identify and analyse only relevant articles. Since different researchers handled the analysis of the different newspapers, we also address a certain number of potential biases and shortcomings by limiting the comparison of absolute numbers. Rather, we compare trends. Moreover, we provide here the detail of the screening process. The articles were identified if one or more of the following criteria were met: the article stated a link between health and climate change; explained the link between health and climate change; or attributed a climatic event to climate change and linking this climatic event to health impacts. In all cases, health refers to one of the health terms mentioned in the table above, the health impact being either positive or negative. Also, all articles do not establish a definite link between health and climate change: some only mention a potential or possible link. Context of publication Despite the fact that articles are mostly clustered around international political events, great attention also seems to be given to the release of scientific reports or publications, as well as various other events, marking the broadening of "media windows" and ensuring more regular publications on the issue of health and climate change. For example, in Le Monde, many `tribunes' (pages provided by newspapers in which points of view can be expressed by the public) demonstrate commitment from various communities (researchers, Nobel prices, business leaders); more space is also dedicated to articles presenting one specific impact on health (for example	1
mental health and extreme climate events or coccidioidomycosis and climate change in Le Monde). Geographical range of reference Although global events are covered in all three newspapers, articles in 2017 still focused mostly on national contexts (58% of articles focusing on the US for The New York Times, 30% focusing on France for Le Monde, and 11% focusing on Germany for the FAZ).	1
5: Political and broader engagement 5.2: Coverage of health and climate change in scientific journals We tracked the use of climate-related terms and their co-occurrence with health terms using a bibliometric search in both PubMed and Web of Science databases. The search terms were the following and adapted according to the database: Climate change related terms Health related terms Climate Change Health Global warming Disease Climate variability - Non-Communicable	1
This list of search terms were found to be exhaustive and appropriate for scientific databases. A more detailed search syntax, including the diseases of poverty used by indicator 5.3 was not necessary as with the use of medical subject headings (MeSH-Terms) for instance in PubMed those diseases are covered through the MeSH Term "Communicable diseases". Different search syntaxes were applied and the final number of overall publications did not show to vary significantly underlining that the search strategy was robust and able to capture most relevant articles. Titles and abstracts of identified papers for relevance to the topic were screened three times. The results were then merged using the Endnote reference manager software and duplicates removed. Conflicts were resolved within the research team and a final selection of articles were prepared for analysis. The stepwise process of the selection of articles is presented in the flow chart below.	1
Numbers indicate the article count retained at each step of the process. With the applied search terms more than 9000 scientific articles on climate change and health were identified for the period of 2007-2017. After the screening process only 25,8% (n=2547) were retained and found to be relevant. Indeed, a majority just mentioned climate change in the abstract and did not focus on the link between climate change and health. Other articles explored ecological health or animal health but not human health and were therefore excluded. A minority of papers	1
were excluded as these were book chapters or conference proceedings referenced in both databases. After the screening process, data was extracted, categorized and coded to allow for statistical analysis of the results. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied in order to capture the most relevant literature. Only peer-reviewed scientific articles on climate change and population health in English were included. This means that all articles including original quantitative and qualitative studies, reviews, editorials, viewpoints or comments are covered in this indicator. Also, no restriction to country or population was applied. Moreover, articles that mention climate-related or health-related terms in titles or abstracts but did not have a specific focus or direct link between climate change and health were excluded. Geographical coverage Geographically, the majority of publications address the impact of climate change and health in Europe, the Americas and the Western Pacific Region. Except for the region the Americas, all other regions did not show a significantly increase in the number of scientific publications in 2017.	1
Number of scientific publications on climate change and health between 20062017 according to world region Comparison with scientific publications on climate change in general For comparison, we also display the total number of scientific publications on climate change in general, for the same time period. There is a linear increase in the number of scientific publications that more than tripled from approx. 12,000 in 2007-2008 to approx. 43,000 in 2016-2017.	1
This indicator only used two databases, which may be a limitation even though both databases are complementary and cover together the majority of the scientific publications in the area of climate change and human health. Moreover, grey literature is not captured in this indicator and may bias the results. The restriction to publications in English language only may be a caveat. Also the number of scientific publications on climate change in general were not screened manually for relevance due to their volume. Finally, the quality of identified scientific publications are not assessed and analysis was conducted using the title and abstract of articles due to the restrictions in locating full texts for the large volume of articles included. This indicator aims to provide a mapping of existing scientific publications in the area of climate change and health. It will offer a better understanding of the research gaps and trends as well as researchers engagements on this crucial issue over time. The search syntax can be used each year to track the number of scientific articles on climate change and health. In the future, each identified scientific publication will be categorized according to different criteria (geographical focus, type of article, health outcome, type of climate change measurement, etc.) in order to provide more details over time on the research trends and engagements. Other contents, such as the growth trend of this field, the productive institutions, countries that contribute to those papers, citations and cooperations could also be analyzed in the future.	1
In order to produce an indicator of engagement with the intersection of climate change and health, we focused on whether any of the climate change related terms appeared immediately before or after any health terms in the GD statements. This was based on a search of the 25 words before and after a reference to a climate change related term. The choice of 25-word window context corresponds to approximately half a paragraph of text. Given that GD statements are highly structured and methodically developed by governments over prolonged periods of time, we assume that half a paragraph of text around public health terms captures a sufficiently narrow context. We then search and count the number of climate change term references in these contexts to produce the measure of engagement with the link between health and climate change. We conducted a robustness analysis by varying the size of the context (5, 10, and 50 words). This substantively produced the same trends over time. We also further examined a sample of the references produced by the search as an additional check to ensure that the references identified reflect engagement with the health impacts of climate change. To produce this indicator, we draw on a new and updated dataset of GD statements: the United Nations General Debate corpus, in which the annual GD statements have been pre-processed and prepared for the application of natural language processing to the official English versions of the statements.1 The dataset contains all of the country speeches made in the UN General Debate between 1970 and 2017. Table X0 presents summary of the data by year. Table 3. Summary information for UN General Debate Corpus. Year General Total Debate sentences Statements	1
The data was pre-processed for analysis by removing punctuation, symbols, numbers, and URLs. We also removed any tokens smaller than three characters to reduce typos and mistakes from the document digitisation process. In addition, all tokens were normalised (lowercased). All pre-processing and analysis was carried out in R using "quanteda" package.1 Caveats	1
The search for climate change terms in the context of public health references is a proxy for the semantic linkage between the two sets of terms in GD statements. This approach produces a scalable and reproducible measure with a high degree of reliability that does not involve human judgement or subjective biases. However, there may be examples of governments referring to climate change and health but not the direct linkages between the two, which are included in the count; and there may be examples of governments discussing the health impacts of climate change in their GD statements, which are not included in our measure because the distance between the mention of the climate change term and the health term exceeds 25 words. Based on an analysing a sample of the speeches and references, such cases are rare and do not have a significant bearing on the indicator or the trends uncovered. It is also worth noting that the analysis here is based on a narrow range of search terms, which excludes reference to many of indirect links between climate change and health. A number of GD statements in this time period refer to such indirect connections, such as the effects of climate change on water and agriculture - however, these are not included here. Therefore, the results present a somewhat conservative estimate of high level political engagement with the intersection of climate change and health. Future work in this area will consider engagement with these indirect links.	1
In the future, we plan on looking more closely at the references to indirect links between climate change and health. For example, what are the main ways in which governments view climate change impacting on health? We will consider whether this changes over time based on awareness of the multiple ways in which climate change and health are connected. We will also look to expand this indicator by considering private sector engagement with climate change and health. Specifically, for next iteration of the indicator we will examine annual corporate social responsibility and	1
sustainability reports ("Triple Bottom Line Reports") of major international corporations. Using these report, we will perform similar searches (engagement with health, climate change, and intersection of the two) based on these reports. We present some additional findings and breakdowns in this section. Figure 1 below presents the proportion of countries that engage with the intersection of climate change and health by WHO region. It is worth noting that the relatively higher level of political engagement by countries in the Western Pacific is especially driven by the small island development states (SIDS) in this region. It also worth noting that North America WHO region contains only two countries, USA and Canada. As neither of these countries refer to the health impacts of climate change (the US statement made no reference to climate change), the North America region has zero proportion of countries engaged with the climate change-health links.	1
Figure 2 below presents the total number of references to the health impacts of climate change in GD statements between 1970 and 2017. This is based on the approach we used in last year's report, whereby we present the total count of separate references to the intersection of health and climate change rather than the proportion of countries. The figure demonstrates a very similar trend to when we consider the proportion of countries; with both approaches we see spikes in 2009-10 and 2014.	1
Figure 3, below, presents the total number of references to the climate change health link between 1970 and 2017 by WHO region. The figure shows that the most references tend to be made by countries in the Western Pacific. Countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe are the most engaged after the Western Pacific countries. In general, the figure suggests that there is lower engagement among countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, North America, and South-East Asia. 40	1
Figure 4 below shows the level of political engagement with climate change and health separately, rather than engagement with the intersection of climate change and health. This is measured by the references to the key search terms associated with climate change and health in General Debate speeches. Figure 5 shows the proportion of countries that refer to public health in their GD statements between 1970 and 2017, while Figure 6 shows the proportion of countries that make a reference to climate change during this period. The figures show that in general there is higher levels of engagement with climate	1
change than health. Figures 4 and 6 also show a sharp increase in engagement with climate change in the General Debate around 2006, followed by a decline in 2009 after the COP 15 in Copenhagen that year. However, there has been an increase in engagement with climate change in recent years around the Paris Agreement. Engagement with health has in comparison been lower. However, there has broadly been increasing engagement with public health during this time period, and a sharp increase in 2000 with the launch of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). There is also an increase in the salience of global health from 2012 onwards, which coincides with the transition from the MDGs to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).	1
Figure 7 below presents a world map, which shows the countries that refer to the intersection of climate change and health in their 2017 GD statements, and the number of individual references they make. The map shows the relatively low level of engagement with the health impacts of climate change around the world in 2017. However, due to their size the SIDS do not show up on the map. As we have noted, the SIDS tend to be highly represented among nations engaging with the health-climate change links. Figures 8 and 9 present world maps, which show the countries that refer to public health and climate change respectively in their 2017 GD statements, as well as indicating the number of references made by each country. The figures demonstrate that while there is relatively low engagement with the intersection of health and climate change, there is considerable engagement with the issues of climate change and health separately. Figures 8 and 9 show that as well as a much larger share of countries around the world discussing climate change and health in their GD statements compared to those discussing the intersection, there is also much deeper engagement with these two areas individually, in that countries tend to make a number of references to climate change and health in their GD statements. 2017 UN General Debate	1
5. Public and political engagement 5.4 Engagement in health and climate change in the corporate sector In order to produce the measure of engagement with climate change and health in companies' UN Global Compact Communication of Progress (COP) reports, we used the publicly available COP reports. Our approach to using the COP reports to produce the indicators is based on identifying references to key search terms linked to (a) health, and (b) climate change. Table 4.

In order to produce an indicator of engagement with the intersection of climate change and health, we focused on whether any of the climate change related terms appeared immediately before or after any public health terms in the COP reports. This was based on a search of the 25 words before and after a reference to a public health related term. Table X0 presents total number of references identified in COP reports per year, where the column "Intersection" is the count of climate change terms appearing in the context (25 words before and after) of health terms.	1

A total of 33,631 reports were downloaded from COP. The reports are available from companies based in 129 countries. The top 15 countries with the largest number of reports submitted to COP are presented in Table 6.	1
COP reports are submitted in 30 different languages. Top 15 most frequently used languages in the reports are presented in Table 7. Table 7: Top 15 most frequently used languages in COP reports. Language	1As noted above, we have only considered COP reports that were submitted in English. This means we have analysed just under half of all available UN General Compact COP reports.	1
This analysis here is based on a narrow range of search terms, which excludes reference to many of indirect links between climate change and health. Reports may also discuss indirect connections, such as the effect of climate change on agriculture, however, these are not included here. Therefore, the results present a somewhat conservative estimate of high corporate engagement with the intersection of climate change and health. Future work in this area will consider engagement with these indirect links, as well as providing additional forms of analysis. In the future, we aim to increase the number of reports we analyse by translating our key search terms into several other key languages, and incorporating reports submitted in languages other than English into our sample. Translation of key terms has been implemented in WG5 into Spanish, Portuguese, and German. We plan to expand our analysis using these translations for next year's report. We present some additional findings and breakdowns in this section. Figure 11 below presents the levels of corporate engagement with the intersection of climate change and health by WHO region. The graphs shows the proportion of companies based in the different WHO regions that refer to the health impacts of climate change in their annual COP report. As noted in the main report, we see the highest engagement from companies based in the Western Pacific and North America. In contrast, the lowest engagement is from companies based in the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean regions.	1
Figure 12 below shows the total number of references to the health impacts of climate change in companies UN General Compact COP reports between 2011 and 2017. The graph shows an increase in the number of mentions of the intersection of health and climate change during this period. This is likely to be in part driven by the increased number of COP reports submitted during this time. However, there is also an increase in engagement between 2014 and 2017 irrespective of the increased number of reports submitted.	1
Figure 13 below shows the total number of references to public health and climate change (separately) in COP reports between 2011 and 2017. The graph shows that references to health-related issues in the COP reports tends to be higher than climate change issues, and that references to both are much higher than references to the intersection of health and climate change. The graph also shows an increase in references to both health and climate change. However, this is likely to be driven by the increase in the number of reports submitted during this period.	1
Figure 14 below shows the proportion of COP reports across the entire time period (2011-2017) the make reference to the health impacts of climate change (and climate change and health separately) by the sector in which the company operates. It is worth noting that the sector categories have been determined by the UN Global Compact. There are some significant differences in engagement with the health impacts of	1
Figure 15 below presents a world map showing the proportion of companies in different countries that engage with the intersection of climate change and health in their 2017 COP reports. The map shows the relatively low level of engagement with the health impacts of climate change around the world in 2017. The map shows the relatively high level of engagement with climate change-health linkages in the Western Pacific and North America. The map also shows particularly high levels of engagement in Russia and Central Asia, and Saudi Arabia, although this is in part due to fewer companies based in the regions being signed up to the UN Global Compact, and submitting reports in English. Figures 16 and 17 present world maps that show the proportion of companies in different countries that refer to public health and climate change respectively in their 2017 COP reports. The maps show that there is typically more engagement with health and climate change (separately) than with the intersection of the two. Broadlyspeaking, the maps show similar country trends to Figure 15. However, there is significantly higher corporate engagement with health across Asia and Africa than there is with climate change or the intersection of the two.	1

1: Climate Change Impacts, Exposures, and Vulnerability 1.1: Health and heat 1.1.1: Vulnerability to extremes of heat The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report appendix.1 This indicator displays an index derived by taking mean of proportion of the population over 65 years;2 the prevalence of cardiovascular, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases among population over 65 years using GBD study 2017 estimates;3 and the proportion of the population living in urban areas as a measure of exposure to urban heat island.4 The index ranges between 0 and 100 and is a measure of potential vulnerability to heat exposure of the population over 65 years by country.

1: Climate Change Impacts, Exposures, and Vulnerability 1.1: Health and heat 1.1.2: Health and exposure to warming The methodology for this indicator remains similar to that described in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report appendix,1 with improved resolution for the 2019 report. Change in summer temperature was calculated on a global grid (0.5 spacing). A baseline temperature grid was calculated as the average of summer temperatures (June, July, August for the northern hemisphere, December, January, February for the southern hemisphere) from 1986-2005 using a global grid of temperatures from the ERA-Interim numerical weather reanalysis dataset. Using this same dataset, temperature changes relative to the 1986-2005 average were calculated for every grid point for every year. The `area weighted' average of the grid was calculated by weighting each grid cell by the relative area of that grid cell on the earth's surface, to take into account the mapping from the 2D rectangular grid to the spherical earth's surface. The `population weighted' average was calculating by weighting each grid cell by the fraction of the total world population contained within that grid cell.

1: Climate Change Impacts, Exposures, and Vulnerability 1.1: Health and heat 1.1.3: Health and exposure of vulnerable populations to heatwaves The methodology for this indicator remains similar to that described in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report appendix,1 with improved resolution for the 2019 report. A heatwave was defined as a period more than 3 days at a given location where the minimum daily temperature was greater than the 99th percentile of the distribution of minimum daily temperature at that location over the 1986-2005 reference period for the summer months. Calculations were performed on a 0.5 global grid using ERA-Interim data. The gridded 99th percentile of daily minimum temperature was calculated for 19862005. For each year from 1986 to present, the number of heatwave events and total days of heatwaves per year was calculated according to the definition above. For each year from 2000 to present, the change in number of occurrences and number of days of heatwaves was calculated. The vulnerable population was defined as people over the age of 65. Gridded population and demographic data from GPWv4 was used. The change in exposures in person-events was calculated for each year by multiplying the change in number of heatwave events by the number of vulnerable people per grid cell.	1
Additionally, the mean change in length of heatwaves weighted by vulnerable population was calculated. Climate data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), ERA-Interim project.5 Population data from the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) Gridded Population of the World (GPWv4).6 Future versions of this indicator are expected to migrate to ECMWF ERA5 climate data source.	1
1: Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.1: Health and heat 1.1.4: Change in labour capacity Global gridded (0.5) three hourly temperature, dew point temperature and surface solar radiation downwards was used to calculate wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) WBGT indoors (or outdoors in the shade) and WBGT outdoors in the sun. The WBGT calculator used was downloaded from  A productivity loss function derived from experimental data was used to quantify the productivity loss with increasing WBGT. The function relating the fraction of total work hours lost to Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) is given by the cumulative normal distribution function: 1 WBGT - Prodmean   = (1 + ERF ( )) 2 ProdSD  2 Where WBGT is WBGTmax, WBGTmean or WBGThalf and the parameters for a given activity level (defined as the amount of internal heat generated in performing the activity) are given in Table 1. Labour is divided into three sectors: service (activity level of 200W), industry (300W), and agriculture (400W). The loss curves for 200W, 300W, and 400W are shown in Figure 1.	1
person to obtain the total population weighted hours lost in that grid cell. The total work hours lost (WHL) are then summed for global totals or country totals. To obtain the "equivalent full-time workers lost", potential WHL are divided by 4380 - the potential maximum daylight hours that can be worked per year.

Sector employment from ILO.7 The distribution of agricultural, manufacturing and service sector workers is only reported at country level, hence this proportion is distributed evenly to all grid cells. In the future this indicator will have finer detail on the sector employment. Potential full-time work lost assumes 12 hours a day, 365 days a year. Future versions of this indicator shall work to estimate potential full-time equivalent work lost, by linking potential WHL with average annual hours worked by country and sector. This indicator will be updated in future to show the number of workers affected globally and in larger countries (eg China and India).	1
1: Climate Change Impacts, Exposures, and Vulnerability 1.2: Health and extreme weather events 1.2.1: Wildfires Fire point locations were matched to a political border shapefile from the Global Burden of Disease (version 2017)8 with 195 defined nations. Population count per squared-kilometre was matched to the GBD global shapefile using the NASA GPWv4 dataset. For each country, the daily number of fire points were multiplied by the total population count within the corresponding grid point to estimate the number of persons exposed to a fire event in a day. The number of persons exposed to a fire event in a day per country were averaged for years 2001-2004 and 2015-2018 to give a change in person days exposed to fire. Collection 6 active fire product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).9 This contains both Terra (from November 2000) and Aqua (from July 2002) pixels in the same annual file Population data from the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) Gridded Population of the World (GPWv4).6 The satellite data does not account for cloud cover or smoke and data is not collected at night. While observing the same fire, Terra and Aqua may report slightly different coordinates of the fire centroid, therefore introducing a double counting issue. Fire characteristics change every year, and a year to year comparison is not appropriate. The average of the first four years of available MODIS data acts as an initial starting point to compare later years to reflect change. However, the GPW population count was not interpolated and may results in higher uncertainties in estimation of persons exposed. This indicator will be extended to longer term averages. Subnational estimates will be reported to better represent the populations at risk.	1
1: Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.2: Health and extreme weather events 1.2.2: Flood and drought The methodology for this indicator remains similar to that described in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report appendix,1 with improved resolution for the 2019 report. Drought The drought indicator was based on the WMO-recommended Standard Precipitation Index (SPI),10 based on the 6-month rolling sum of monthly precipitation. The index was calibrated using gridded monthly precipitation data covering the period from 1900-2005 from the CRU monthly precipitation dataset. A given month was defined as being in drought when the SPI for that month is less than -1.5. Yearly totals of months in drought were calculated on a 0.5 global grid. Exposure to drought was calculated using the GPWv4 gridded population dataset. The drought indicator is defined as gridded sum of months in drought times the gridded population and is given in units of person-months in drought. Extreme rainfall Extreme rainfall events are defined as starting when the 5-day rolling sum of daily precipitation exceeding the 10-year return level and ending when it dropped below this value. The rolling sum of precipitation was calculated for each day as the sum of the preceding 5 days total precipitation (in mm). The precipitation value corresponding to the 10-year return period was calculated using the method described the corresponding Lancet Climate Countdown 2018 appendix.1 The baseline precipitation threshold was calculated by applying this method to daily total precipitation derived from ERA-Interim for the period 19862005. The number of extreme rainfall events per year in the period 2000 to present 8	1

This section defines indicators of meteorological drought and flood risk, which must be understood to be a precursor and a necessary but not sufficient condition for the occurrence of agricultural and hydrological drought and flood. Future versions of this indicator are expected to migrate to ECMWF ERA5 climate data source.	1
1: Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.2: Health and extreme weather events 1.2.3: Lethality of weather-related disasters The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the 2018 report of the Lancet Countdown.1 This indicator is based on the generic formulation from a climate change perspective of disasters as a function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Year to year variation was measured, showing the number of people killed as a proportion of those affected by different hazard type, normalised by the strength of the individual hazards as a measure of adaptive (or maladaptive) changes in national health care services and the associated disaster preparedness and response. Here, deaths are defined as the number of people who lost their life because the disaster happened, and people affected as those requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency; hence requiring basic survival needs such as food, water, shelter, sanitation and immediate medical assistance. The data has been presented as standardised anomalies, representing the difference between the variable that year and average of the variable from 19902009, normalised by the standard deviation of the variable over the same period.	1
Only statistically significant (at 0.05 significance level) linear trends over time are shown. EM-DAT at the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) at the Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium12 One underlying assumption is that the normalised number of people killed by climate related disasters is an accurate proxy for measuring health impacts of the climate. This measure ignores the longer causal chains involving the interaction of climate and health.	1
Finally, a further limitation is that this measure ignores the longer causal chains involving the interactions of weather, climate, disasters, health and health services Future efforts will include a comparison of estimates of those exposed with those affected. Additionally, the impact of replacing the number of people killed with the number requiring assistance also explored. A subsidiary indicator will come from the online Sendai Framework Monitor. Here countries will start reporting against the Sendai Framework indicators and the DRR related indicators of the SDGs. The first Sendai Framework and SDG progress report will be released in 2019. This indicator therefore aims to expand to include country specific progress in vulnerability levels of health service systems to climate risks in relation to this monitoring data.	1
1: Climate Change Impacts, Exposures, and Vulnerability 1.3: Global health trends in climate-sensitive diseases The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report appendix.1 This indicator displays generally unprocessed descriptive trends for selected diseases retrieved from The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project database over the period 1990-2017.8 The derivation of estimates within the GBD study relies on modelling, rather than analysing direct observations, and the GBD methodology has already been described.13 The trends are aggregated and presented by WHO region as mortality rates per 100,000 individuals per year over the period. As far as can be ascertained from the GBD documentation, climate change and weather are not part of the covariates included in the estimates, making it valid to examine GBD outputs in the light of climate and weather data to formulate coherent inter-country comparisons. Trends are described for: all causes of death, malaria, dengue, diarrhoeal diseases, protein-energy malnutrition, heat and cold exposure, and forces of nature. Deaths directly related to forces of nature have been adjusted for the effects of the most severe seismic events and related tsunamis. Years with events reported to have caused a substantial death toll from 1990 to 2016 where discounted by replacing with the same countries' force of nature mortality for the previous year. Global Burden of Disease Study 20178	1
This is not a direct measure of the impact of climate change on death and disease. Rather, it presents mortality figures for those diseases which are none to be influenced by climate. The trends presented therefore do not show detection and attribution of climate change to death. They do show the impact of climate relevant and climate sensitive diseases on mortality rates globally since 1990. GBD estimates are now revised annually. Future versions of this indicator may include additional health conditions, may include morbidity as well as mortality, and may extend to national and subnational scales. Increased interest in geospatial disease analyses is likely to lead to additional information, such as fringe zone trends and outbreaks, and associate patterns of diseases to climate anomalies, such as those driven by the ENSO circulation. Future disease trends in the GBD estimates will be linked to direct measurements in resource poor areas in Africa and Asia, for example using longitudinal mortality registers from the INDEPTH network.13	1
1: Climate Change Impacts, Exposures, and Vulnerability 1.4: Climate-sensitive infectious diseases 1.4.1 Climate-sensitive infectious diseases - dengue Context: Cases of dengue have doubled every decade since 1990, with 584 million (236 million-1219 million) apparent cases in 2013, accounting for over 10,000 deaths and 114 million (073 million-198 million) disability-adjusted life-years.14 Beside global mobility, climate change has been suggested as one potential contributor to this increase in burden.15 Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus, the principal vectors of dengue, also carry other important emerging or re-emerging arboviruses, including Yellow Fever, Chikungunya, Mayaro, and Zika viruses, and are likely to be similarly responsive to climate change. Methods: Methods for calculating vectorial capacity (VC) follow Rocklov et al. (2019).16 VC refers to a vector's ability to transmit disease to humans. It incorporates interactions between host, virus, and vector, assuming that all three of these elements are present. Specifically, VC represents the average daily number of secondary cases generated by one primary case introduced into a fully susceptible population, and is expressed as:  = 2   /- where a is the average vector biting rate,  is the probability of vector infection and transmission of virus to its saliva, p is the daily survival probability, n is the duration of the extrinsic incubation period - EIP, and m is the female vector-to-human population ratio. Here m is set to 1 assuming female vector and human population are constant. Detailed model description and explanation can be found in Rocklov et al. (2019).16 In this application, the time unit is 1 day and each of the vector parameters depends on temperature, with parameter values derived from the literature, typically from experimental data, as described in Liu-Helmersson et al., (2014).17 Diurnal temperature range (DTR) was reconstructed using a representative daily temperature through a 14	1
piece-wise sinusoidal function based on the monthly average of daily minimum, maximum, and mean observations. Historical trends were derived by backcasting the models on data from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) online database, time series (CRU-TS 3.22) of gridded (0.5) monthly averages of daily temperature observations (minimums, maximum, and mean) for the time period 1950-2017. Future projections were derived using climate data under two greenhouse gas emission pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5),18 representing the contrast between very strong mitigation action vs. business-as-usual given consequent radiative forcing of greenhouse gases in the year 2100 (+2.6 and +8.5 W m-2, respectively), based on CMIP5 atmosphere-ocean general circulation models.19,20 For each emission pathway, CMIP5 temperature datasets (min, max, mean resolution 0.5 x 0.5) were used. Calculations from each of the five global models (NorESM1-M, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, IPSL-CM5A-LR, HadGEM2-ES, and GFDL-ESM2M) were averaged to derive a multimodel ensemble. The annual average VC were extracted values per grid cell to Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus presence locations provided in Kraemer et al. (2015)21 and averaged these values by country to get country-specific trends in VC at monthly (seasonality analysis) or yearly time steps from 1950-2017 for each species. `Global vectorial capacity' indicates globally averaged values across all countries. Historical percentage change figures reported in the main text were calculated relative to a 1950s baseline (5 year average, 1950-54), either an average for the 2010s (5 year average, 2013-2017) to illustrate the overall trend accounting for interannual variability or for the most recent year for which data were available (2017). Projected percentage changes in VC for each vector in 2030 (taken from 5yr average 2028-2032) was calculated relative to a present baseline (5 yr average 2013-2017). ae.back	1
To produce this plot, all countries in the analysis have been centred around their `peak month' as per a 1950 baseline. The plot illustrates that VC is increasing on average in all months of the year, reflecting higher maximum values and broader seasons.	1

Projections to 2050 are also shown for two RCP scenarios (8.5 is equivalent to a `business-as-usual' high emissions pathway while 2.6 is a strong mitigation pathway, such that the difference illustrates the effect of GHG emissions on disease risk). Caveats	1
Key caveats and limitations of the VC model and its parameterisation are fully described in Liu-Helmersson et al. (2014, 2016)17,22 and Rocklov et al., (2019).16 VC should not be confused with actual dengue cases, although it is an indicator of the risk of infection. The disease indicators will be reported upon annually and assessed against the baseline data and trends presented here. Other climate-sensitive infectious diseases in addition to malaria, Vibrio, and dengue will be added through time and the current indicators refined. In future, it is intended to expand efforts to project trends (as for dengue) using available models (e.g., RCPs from AR5). In addition, efforts will expand to link environmental suitability information to disease outcomes e.g., via disease case or surveillance data. Numerous jurisdictions currently already undertake indicator (e.g., annual country- or regional-level reporting of confirmed human cases), eventbased (e.g., outbreak investigation and `epidemic intelligence'), and biosecurity (e.g., 16	1
sentinel site) surveillance for infectious diseases, vectors, or key zoonotic hosts. Many of these datasets and methods of analysis could be made available and leveraged in future for the Lancet Countdown. For example, EU member states already report cases of notifiable diseases, zoonotic diseases, and outbreaks of food-borne and zoonotic disease, while vector surveillance remains voluntary.23	1
1: Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability 1.4: Climate-sensitive infectious diseases 1.4.1 Climate-sensitive infectious diseases - malaria Context Temperature, precipitation and relative humidity are climatic factors that impact the abundance and feeding cycle rate of Anopheles mosquitoes, which transmit the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. Temperature also drives the development rate of Plasmodium parasites within the mosquito vectors24Temperatures within the range 18C to 32C are considered most suitable for P. falciparum, while a lower temperature limit of 15C has been reported for P. vivax.25 Below these lower limits the development of the parasite ceases while above 32C the survival of the mosquito is compromised. Relative humidity greater than 60% is also considered as a requirement for the mosquito to survive long enough for the parasite to develop sufficiently to be transmitted to the human host stage. Rainfall and surface water are needed for the egg laying and larval stages of the mosquito life cycle, with monthly rainfall accumulation of at least 80mm considered more suitable for transmission.24 A recent study found a significant increase in elevation of the lower temperature limits for the development of malaria parasites in Ethiopia.26 Increasing temperatures in the region are eroding the perceived barrier to malaria transmission, allowing more favourable conditions to begin climbing into densely populated highland areas. Highland areas are the most densely populated agro-climatic zone in sub-Saharan Africa, occupying just 4.4% of the land area but 19.4% (44 million) of the population. The malaria indicator focuses on determining global changes in climate suitability over time between highland and lowland areas in regions that have not yet achieved elimination. Methods The number of months suitable for malaria transmission per year from 1950 - 2017 was calculated globally. Suitability is based on empirically-derived thresholds of precipitation, temperature and relative humidity for two primary parasites causing malaria (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax). Monthly observations of temperature, precipitation and vapour pressure data from the Climate Research Unit (CRU TS4.01)11 were downloaded using the KNMI Climate Explorer.27 The variables were extracted at a 0.5 spatial resolution over land. Elevation data at a 0.5 spatial resolution was obtained from JISAO, University of Washington.28 Following New et al., (2002), relative humidity (RH) was estimated using the formula:	1
where  is vapour pressure and  is saturated vapour pressure (in hPa) at mean air temperature T in C, given by:  = 6.108 exp [17.27  /(237.3 + )] . Climatic suitability was defined as the coincidence of precipitation accumulation greater than 80 mm, average temperature between 18C and 32C, and relative humidity greater than 60% for P. falciparum.24 Suitability for P. vivax was calculated using the same thresholds with the exception of a lower average temperature limit of 15C.24,29 The combined values are an indication of the lower limit for potential malaria transmission for each species. The mean number of months per year with suitable climate conditions for malaria transmission was then calculated across 3 continents (Africa, Asia, and the Americas) according to the dominant parasite present (Africa = P falciparum, other regions = P. vivax).30The analysis by malaria management status was further subdivided following country classifications from Newby et al. (2016)31 who classified countries in the following categories: malaria controlling, malaria eliminating, or malaria free (Figure 13) A time series was included for the category malaria controlling countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia (see main text).	1
Figure 13: Categorisation of countries as malaria-free, eliminating malaria, or controlling malaria, 2015.31 In addition to management status, the analysis was stratified by elevation to contrast trends in highland areas (>=1500m) and lowland areas (<1500m). The percentage change figures reported in the main text were calculated relative to a 1950s baseline (5 year average, 1950-54 compared to 5 year average, 2013-2017) to illustrate the overall trend accounting for interannual variability.	1
Figure 14: Environmental suitability for malaria 1950 to 2017, grouped by continent and elevation (high >=1500m, low <1500m). Results are for the dominant malarial parasite in each region (P. falciparum in Africa; P vivax in other regions). Caveats	1
These results are based on climatic data, not malaria case data. The malaria suitability climate thresholds used are based on a consensus of the literature. In practice, the optimal and limiting conditions for transmission are dependent on the particular species of the parasite and vector.24Control efforts might limit the impact of these climate changes on malaria or conversely, the climate suitability may either enhance or hamper control efforts.32	1
1: Climate Change Impacts, Exposures, and Vulnerability 1.4: Climate-sensitive infectious diseases 1.4.1 Climate-sensitive infectious diseases - Vibrio Context Vibrio spp. are globally distributed aquatic bacteria that are ubiquitous in warm estuarine and coastal waters with low to moderate salinity. V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and non-toxigenic V. cholerae (non-O1/non-O139) are pathogenic in humans. These Vibrio species are associated with sporadic cases of gastroenteritis, wound infections, ear infections, or septicaemia in circumscribed localities. Vibrio ecology, abundances, distributions, and patterns of infection are often strongly mediated by environmental conditions. Water temperature, salinity, and turbidity predict the distribution and abundance of V. vulnificus in Chesapeake Bay, with the number of infections increasing as a result of recent local warming and changes in rainfall.33 Increased water temperatures also explain outbreaks of Vibrio infections in countries bordering the Baltic Sea,34 and range expansions in Alaska.35 This indicator focuses on mapping environmental suitability for pathogenic Vibrio spp. in coastal zones globally (<30km from coast). Methods: The indicator uses thresholds of >18C for Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and <30 PSU for Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). These values were derived on the basis of a consensus in the literature.36-38 Estimates for SST were obtained from NOAA Optimum Interpolation 1/4 19	1
Degree Daily Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) Analysis version 2 for the period 1982-2017. This dataset is provided by the NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD.39 The salinity fields were created from daily data obtained from Mercator Ocean Reanalysis.40 Here suitability is reported at two levels. First, it was calculated the percentage of coastline globally that experienced suitable conditions for Vibrio infections and summarised the results across three latitudinal bands (northern latitudes = 40-70N; tropical latitudes = 25S-40N; and southern latitudes = 25-40S). Second, suitability in two focal regions in which human Vibrio infection is frequently observed, the Baltic Sea and the northeastern coast of the United States (36-50N) were calculated. For the Baltic (main text) and northeastern coast of the United States coast the percentage of coastline suitable for Vibrio infections are presented. In addition, the number of days per year suitable for outbreaks is presented for the Baltic (main text). The percentage change figures reported in the main text were calculated relative to a 1980s baseline (5 year average, 1982-86), either an average for the 2010s (5 year average, 2014-2018) to illustrate the overall trend accounting for interannual variability or for the most recent year for which data were available (2018).	1
The results are derived on the basis of suitable SST and SSS conditions only, and do not include other potentially important drivers (e.g. globalisation), environmental predictors of 20	1
pathogenic Vibrio infections (e.g., cholorphyll-a, turbidity) nor disease case data. Nevertheless, these associations have been explored and are reported in the supporting references included above. In the global analysis, the slope of the trendlines over the time series is mostly flat for the tropical/subtropical region and the southern Hemisphere. However, the SST-only suitability shows a strong upward trend in the southern hemisphere, indicating that on average temperature conditions are also improving growth conditions for Vibrio in these areas, while SSS is generally limiting. However, locally suitable SSS conditions will also occur in these regions on the basis of, for example, variation in local rainfall and river runoff, which can make these regions sporadically suitable for Vibrio infections.	1
1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures, and Vulnerability 1.4: Climate-sensitive infectious diseases 1.4.1 Climate-sensitive infectious diseases - Vibrio cholerae Context: Cholera is a water-borne disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which generally occurs in brackish riverine, estuarine, and coastal waters (Colwell and Huq 2001). Toxigenic Vibrio cholerae is responsible for epidemic cholera, while non-toxigenic Vibrio cholerae is responsible for sporadic cases of mild gastroenteritis, but not cholera. Improvements in water sanitation and health care services (e.g. oral cholera vaccine) have facilitated the control of cholera worldwide.41 However, the ongoing, 7th cholera pandemic has an estimated burden of ~2.8 million cases annually that result in ~95,000 deaths per year, mainly in Africa.42 Cholera control is achievable via safe drinking water, vaccines, and effective outbreak response. Hence, epidemics emerge under scenarios of pathogen introduction, political instability, war, and extreme water events in already fragile countries. Cholera prevention requires the understanding of the distribution and availability of its pathogen, toxigenic Vibrio cholerae, and the role of the environmental conditions that facilitate or limit V. cholerae emergence and persistence. The abundance of V. cholerae is associated with increases in SST and phytoplankton in coastal waters.43 Thus, the distribution V. cholerae sensu lato was reconstructed using an ecological niche modelling approach linking V. cholerae reports and fine-scale sea surface temperature and phytoplankton in coastal waters during the last 15 years, assuming niche conservatism among toxigenic and non-toxigenic lineages. Methods: Analyses were performed following the protocols described by Escobar et al. (2015)44 to estimate suitable sea waters for V. cholerae under climate variability. The environmental tolerances of V. cholerae were determined based on Escobar et al. (2015) reports of V. cholerae in coastal waters and an ecological niche model based on sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a, which have been found to be main drivers of V. cholerae occurrence.43-45 Annual mean, range, maximum, and minimum values of these oceanographic variables were estimated between 2003 and 2018 to compile 15 years of seawater conditions at 4 km2 cell size in the exclusive economic zone of each country around the world (Figure 16). 21	1
Figure 16: Exclusive economic zone of each country around the world. A distance of ~200 miles was calculated off the coast of each country to resemble the exclusive economic zone defined by the United Nations with country borders defined elsewhere (Figure 16).46 Suitable seawater conditions for V. cholerae were determined by estimating the realised ecological niche of the bacterium. The realised ecological niche was reconstructed by linking V. cholerae reports with sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a values from year 2003 as proxies of abiotic and biotic factors respectively.47 Niche models were developed in a calibration of 100 km around each V. cholerae report as a proxy of the pathogen's potential dispersal.44 Models were done using Maxent, a machine learning algorithm.48 The Maxent version integrated in the kuenm package in R was used to develop a large population of candidate models from which to select the best model. Candidate Maxent models included different regularisation multipliers (i.e., 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2) and diverse combinations of model features (i.e., linear, quadratic, threshold, product, hinge). The most parsimonious and significant model was selected as best model.49 Specifically, the best model was selected based on Akaike information criterion, p-value, and omission rates.49,50	1
The final 2003 model was then projected to all the consecutive years to generate a timeseries analysis of suitable coastal areas for V. cholerae between 2003 and 2018. Models were projected using model extrapolation and strict model transference in Maxent.51 The original continuous values of the models (i.e., V. cholerae suitability index ranging from 0 to ~1) were converted to binary (i.e., suitable or unsuitable for V. cholerae). Binary models were generated using a threshold of 5% omission rate, which removes 5% of the lowest calibration values as a proxy of  = 0.05, generally used in statistics.52 The total area suitable for V. cholerae by country was used as a proxy of cholera transmission risk. Complementarily, for continuous models, the average V. cholerae suitability index was estimated by country as a proxy of coastal areas where the bacterium could successfully establish. Values of suitability were used to generate locally weighted scatterplot smoothing of risk vs. time. Data of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a across coastal areas were collected from the MODIS sensor in the Aqua satellite--launched in 2002 and part of the NASA Earth Observing System. Data were obtained at 4 km2 spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution during the period 2003-2018 and available at  for sea 22	1
surface temperature and at  for chlorophyll-a. Monthly averages from sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a layers (i.e., Level 3 MODIS) were used to estimate annual mean, range, maximum, and minimum values for each variable for each year. These values were used during model calibration. Vibrio cholerae is not habitually surveyed in coastal waters or in environmental samples in general.45 Instead, most V. cholerae reports originate from human cases in inland areas. The limited number of reports used in this modelling framework could result in an underestimation of the epidemiological potential of V. cholerae in coastal waters around the world. To mitigate this limitation, Maxent models were calibrated and projected allowing extrapolation to reduce overfit to the observed values. Beyond the presence of toxigenic V. cholerae, cholera epidemics require a number of non-climate related factors linked to population vulnerability (e.g., WASH failure, conflict, unsafe drinking water). Thus, this assessment focused in one component of cholera transmission risk, the plausible environmental suitability for V. cholerae in coastal waters. Finally, V. cholerae was modelled at the species level, assuming that toxigenic and non-toxigenic lineages would respond similarly to environmental conditions. Sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a conditions in future years will allow to determine percentages of change and their location in coastal waters around the world. New satellite-derived data will allow determining whether trends observed in this analysis are consistent in the coming years. Results indicate that while some locations show stability or decrease in their suitability for V. cholerae, overall, a consistent trend to increase V. cholerae's coastal suitability was detected at global scale, with a particularly strong signal for the past five years.	1

This indicator computes adaptive capacity of a given country to manage threats posed by infectious diseases, taking into account core competency in key areas. The key areas are in surveillance, legislation, food safety, human resources, laboratory, point of entry, response, preparedness, risk communication and zoonosis which form part of International Health Regulations (IHR) Core Capacity Monitoring Framework.53,54A composite index was computed by taking average of the 11 core	1
competencies. The average core capacities outlined in the monitoring framework has shown protective to outbreak risk.55 Specifically, this indicator displays how the vulnerability to mosquito-borne outbreaks transmitted by the Aedes aegypti vectors relates to transmission potential by the vectorial capacity and systemic resilience to infectious outbreaks by the core capacities. Its estimated for each country and then aggregated by WHO regions. The IHR core capacities data covers the period 2010-2017, so trends for this period are presented. Vulnerability was computed by taking the vectorial capacity (VC) (including vector abundance which is normalised to range between 0 and 1) and dividing by the average core capacity of a country.. The formula below is used for the computation of adaptive capacity. Vulnerability = Vectorial capacity / average IHR core capacity The temperature dependent dynamic models developed by Liu-Helmersson et al. (2014)56 and later updated by Rocklov & Tozan (2019.16 The VC included the estimated potential abundance of Aedes aegypti vectors. The abundance was estimated in response to local rainfall and temperature patterns at a daily time scale as outlined in Liu-Helmersson et al (2019).57 Computation of Aedes aegypti VC and abundance estimates was done for each 0.5 x 0.5 grid cells using the Climatic Research Unit dataset (CRU TS 4.02)11 and subsequently aggregated to country level using shapefiles. The CRU TS 4.0211 climate data drives both the VC and the abundance models.	1
CRU Ts 4.02,1901-201711 IHR core capacities data, 2010-2017 The abundance models generate predictions and not observed frequencies in relation to climate conditions, and so should be considered a potential abundance estimate. The IHR data is self-reported by countries and may therefore include reporting bias which would affect this indicator. A reduction of this indicator while keeping the 25	1
The future indicator will make use of the estimated protective effect (relative risk) of the IHR core capacities in modifying the climate induced hazard on vectors and virus interactions.	1
1: Climate Change Impacts, Exposures, and Vulnerability 1.5: Food security and under-nutrition 1.5.1: Terrestrial food security and under-nutrition Actual crop yields vary from year to year not only with variations in weather, but also with changes in variety, farming practices and the occurrence of pest and disease. Crop yields as estimated by crop models are sensitive to the precise form of the crop model, and many models do not account for the short-term extremes that can significantly affect yields. The effect of year-to-year climatic variability on crop yields is therefore here represented by an agri-climatological proxy indicator, calculated from observed climate data and characterising potential variability in yield. Maize, wheat, rice and soybean were selected as important traded and subsistence crops. There are several potential proxies for variability from year to year in crop yield, including the number of hot days during critical periods in the growing season58-61 and the accumulated temperature between lower and upper thresholds over the growing season.58 The proxy used here is based on crop duration, defined as the time taken in a year to accumulate the reference period (1981-2010) average growing season accumulated temperature total (ATT).58 If the ATT is reached early, then the crop matures too quickly and yields are lower than average. Here, the crop duration loss was defined as the difference in the time taken (in days) to accumulate the average growing season accumulated temperature.	1
The index is calculated at a spatial resolution of 0.5, across the area of land under cultivation for each crop.62 The duration of the growing season and the low and high temperature thresholds for the calculation of ATT vary between crops. Climate data is taken from the Climate Research Unit TS4 gridded monthly observed climate data set,11 and synthetic daily data is estimated for each grid cell by applying a regional average daily anomaly to the monthly value. The regional average daily anomaly is calculated from the WFDEI daily climatology.63 The plots in the paper show the global average annual change in crop growth duration. The horizontal dashed line shows the average difference in crop growth duration over the reference period 1981-2010. Note that this is not zero because of the non-linear relationship between ATT and the time taken to accumulate a specific value of ATT.

1: Climate Change Impacts, Exposures, and Vulnerability 1.5: Food security and under-nutrition 1.5.2: Marine food security and under-nutrition Sixteen FAO fishing areas (out of 19; the 3 areas excluded are those located in the Antarctica) which are important in terms of projected impacts and vulnerabilities associated with climate change were selected (Table 2 and Figure 21). Sixty-four countries located in these areas (for which Fish Capture Data is currently available) were selected in order to attribute the impacts of climate change (more specifically sea surface temperature; SST) to deterioration of major coral reef sites (Marine Protected Areas), decreased population of commercial fish species, and the consequent decreased consumption of capture-based fish. Data for SST was obtained from NOAA, and covers from 2003 to 2018. The location of coral reef sites and data on annual maximum bleaching alert area caused by thermal stress was obtained from NOAA Coral Reef Watch Zones , and is available in five-year intervals from 1985 to 2018. Data on fish consumption per capita from 1980 to 2016 was collected from FAO. There is a lack of information in the available databases such as FAO on fish species composition of the captured and farmed fish products. This could in turn lead to some concerns about the methodological approach used to calculate 3 intake. More specifically, most of the approaches are based on fish intake, which usually ignore or underestimate variations in 3 contents of different types of fishes, and especially capture-based compared with farmed-based fish. Figure 19 presents changes in sea surface temperature for the 64 countries investigated from different basins from 2003 to 2018. Figure 21 presents the global occurrence zone of coral reefs while Figure 22 reflects the increasing deterioration of annual maximum Bleaching Alert Area globally and threats to marine primary productivity being expected to follow. Figure 23 presents the trend of capture-based per capita fish consumption; a key source of 3 fatty acids (Table 3). Figure 25 conceptualises the relationship between climate change and decreased consumption of capture-based fish to increased risk of ischemic heart diseases. Between 2003 and 2018, SST rose in 34 of the 64 territorial waters analysed (max. increase 3.5 oC), while even marginal SST decreases (1 oC) in 19 out of 30 territorial waters (Figure 19) could be linked to the weakening of a crucial ocean current, i.e., Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current (AMOC) by 15%, in response to melting ice from Greenland.64,65 Summary exposure value (SEV) is the measure of a population's exposure to a risk factor that takes into account the extent of exposure by risk level and the severity of that risk's contribution to disease burden. SEV for "diet low in seafood omega-3 fatty acids" has increased in most of the investigated countries since 1990; however, there are countries with decreasing trends in exposure to this risk factor as well (Table 4). Nevertheless, the total overall number of deaths and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to diet low in seafood omega-3 fatty acids, has increased in our list of investigated countries; with the most populous countries including China, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh having major impacts on this overall increase (Table 5 and Table 6) 66 Given the unfavourable variations in fish capture over the last three decades, it seems that countries in general have implemented strategies toward increased fish 27	1
farming to compensate for decreased capture-based per capita fish consumption. However, owing to the substantially lower 3 contents of farmed fish compared with captured fish, positive health impacts of this approach is in question. Therefore, adaptation strategies should be focused on shifting the existing fish farming activities from fresh water (in-land waters) to marine water (mariculture systems, e.g., cage culture). Moreover, 3 enrichment in fish farming should also be pursued.	1

2: Adaptation, Planning, and Resilience for Health 2.1: Adaptation planning and assessment 2.1.1: National adaptation plans for health The collection of data for this exercise included a voluntary national survey, the WHO Health and Climate Change Country Survey (2018) that was sent to all WHO member states and was completed by ministry of health focal points. Of the 194 WHO member states, 101 participated in the survey, providing representation from all 6 WHO regions, World Bank Group-defined income categories, and a diverse range of threats and vulnerabilities to the health effects of climate change. Survey participation has grown substantially from the 40 Member States that completed the 2015 WHO Health and Climate Change Country Survey. Validation of the 2018 country reported data was undertaken in multiple steps. First, survey responses were reviewed for missing information or inconsistencies with follow-up questions directed to survey respondents A summary of responses were shared with WHO regional focal points for review and comments. Source documents including national health strategies and plans, and scientific assessments of health vulnerabilities and assessments were collected. A desktop review was conducted to compare with survey results with follow-up to survey respondents to seek clarification or additional documentation. In the case of vulnerability and adaptation assessments, findings were also cross referenced with existing external publications.67 Finally, partial results were reviewed by key national health and climate stakeholders and ministry of health officials as part of the development and review of the WHO UNFCCC health and climate change country profiles. Further information on the WHO Health and Climate Change Country Survey, its methodology and the WHO UNFCCC Health and Climate Change Country Profile Initiative can be found at	1
2018 WHO Health and Climate Country Survey The survey sample is not a representative sample of all countries as this survey was voluntary, however, the inclusion of 101 countries in this survey compared with 40 in the 2015 survey demonstrates a large increase in coverage. Additionally, the WHO is running a climate change and health special initiative in Small Island Developing States and there are 26 small island developing countries and territories represented within the total number of respondents. The WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will be conducted biennially and will continue to be the primary source of data to track this indicator. The future evolution of this indicator will explore the monitoring and review of the existing strategies/plans and progress on level of implementation of strategies/plans. With more countries initiating the national adaptation plan (NAP) process, alignment of the health component with the overall NAP will also be more closely monitored.

The future evolution of this indicator will explore the coverage and comprehensive of the assessments, such as the use of qualitative and/or quantitative data and the use of future projections of risks of climate-sensitive diseases.	1
2: Adaptation, Planning, and Resilience for Health 2.1: Adaptation planning and assessment 2.1.3: City-level climate change risk assessments The CDP serves as an official reporting platform for the Compact of Mayors, and administrates, collects and analyses a global survey of city based environmental and climate change data on an annual basis. In 2018, 489 cities participated in the survey, with 469 reporting publicly, that included questions on emissions, adaptation assessments and plans. Respondents to the surveys to describe the magnitude of the impact of climate based hazards (extremely serious, serious, less serious) and identify three critical assets or services that may be most impacted. Based on this data two indicators can be developed. The first is a global cities-based indicator of government areas that have undertaken a climate change risk or vulnerability assessment.	1
The second is global cities-based indicator of the perceived vulnerability of health infrastructure to climate change. CDP Cities Data This is a sample survey and cities are under no obligation to respond. As such the survey may suffer from selection bias. The majority of responding cities are also from High Income Countries (69%). As such, the results are not representative.

2: Adaptation, Planning, and Resilience for Health 2.2: Climate information services for health The number of World Meteorological Organization (WMO) national member states (NMS) whose Meteorological and Hydrological services are providing climate services to the health sector is calculated based on self-reported information provided by member states to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) through the Country Profile Database Integrated questionnaire. The questionnaire is one of the main sources of information to the WMO Country Profile data base 51	1
and is open all year round for WMO members to update their profile information. Reported data reflects answers to Question number 6.2 of this questionnaire: "Please indicate which user communities/sectors your NMS provides with climate products/information and estimate the extent to which these products are used to improve decisions". "Human Health" is one of multiple sectors which can be chosen. Data	1
The current data source from WMO only considers climate services provided by NMS. It is unclear the degree to which other providers, such as academic institutions and research projects, private sector products, products from other Ministries, or regional and global products and services are being used, in proportion to services made available by NMS. The open questionnaire can be updated at any time by WMO members, therefore the figures here reported may change over the year. As each country may update their profile information at different moments in time, snap shots do not reflect progress for any given year but rather information provided until a certain date. The current questionnaire does not record the number of WMO members that do not provide climate services to the health sector. The questionnaire captures information on the provision of climate services, the status of service provision to the health sector (divided in 5 categories) and the type of services provided (divided in 5 categories as well). However, only the provision and status of climate service has been reported here due to uncertainties over the quality of the data on the type of services provided. Questions do not capture the source or quality of the service and only one of the answer option covers the utility of the climate services. They do not capture whether data originates from national meteorological observations or is resulting from regional or global products. They do not capture the potential use of all-sector forecasts or outlooks which are accessed and used by the health sector. The WMO and WHO have some differences in their individual Member States. Responses collected from WMO Member States, were reclassified according to WHO Region. WMO members that are not individual WHO members were excluded from the analyses and include Macao and Hong Kong (reported as China), Curacao and St. Maartens. The following WHO Members are not Members of WMO, therefore representative data is not available: Andorra, Equatorial Guinea, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, San Marino.	1
WMO will implement new survey instruments in 2019 to provide greater insight on the status of climate service provision for the health sector, and the type of service provided. Other complementary WMO surveys capturing specific product types, user satisfaction, and application areas, may be publicly available in the future to inform future editions of this indicator. The World Health Organization (WHO) conducts a regular climate and health country survey with ministries of health or national health authorities in its 194 Member States. In 2017, this survey added indicators on the inclusion of 52	1
2: Adaptation, Planning, and Resilience for Health 2.3: Adaptation delivery and implementation 2.3.1: Detection, preparedness and response to health emergencies This indicator takes data from the International Health Regulations (IHR (2005)) State Party Self- Assessment Annual Reporting Tool (SPAR). Under the IHR (2005) all States Parties are required to have or to develop minimum core public health capacities to implement the IHR (2005) effectively. IHR (2005) also states that all States Parties should report to the World Health Assembly annually on the implementation of IHR (2005). In order to facilitate this process, WHO developed an IHR Monitoring questionnaire, interpreting the Core Capacity Requirements in Annex 1 of IHR (2005) into 20 indicators for 13 capacities. Since 2010, this self-reporting IHR monitoring questionnaire is sent annually to National IHR Focal Points (NFPs) for data collection. It contains a checklist of 20 indicators specifically developed for monitoring the development and implementation of 13 IHR capacities. The method of estimation calculates the proportion/percentage of attributes (a set of specific elements or functions which reflect the level of performance or achievement of a specific indicator) reported to be in place in a country. The core capacities to implement the International Health Regulations (2005) have been established by a technical group of experts, as those capacities required to detect, assess, notify and report events, and to respond to public health risks and emergencies of national and international concern. To assess the development and strengthening of core capacities, a set of components are measured for each of the core capacities, by considering a set of one to three indicators that measure the status and progress in developing and strengthening the IHR core capacities. Each indicator is assessed by using a group of specific elements referred to as `attributes' that represents a complex set of activities or elements required to carry out this component. The annual questionnaire has been conducted since 2010 with a response rate of 72% in 2012, 66% in 2016 and 85% in 2017, and 100% of countries reporting at least once since 2010. Annual reporting results are complemented by after action reviews, exercises, and joint external evaluation (JEE).	1
At the beginning of 2018, in compliance with the recommendations of the IHR Review Committee on Second Extensions for Establishing National Public Health Capacities and on IHR Implementation , and following formal global consultations with States Parties held in 2015, 2016, and 2017, and 2018, the WHO Secretariat replaced the IHR Monitoring questionnaire by the "IHR State Party Self-assessment Annual Reporting (SPAR) Tool". This has strong implication for the future of this indicator: preparedness and response capacities have now been merged into one capacity called "C8: National health emergency framework"; one capacity relevant to climate adaptation and resilience has been added ( "C9: Health services provision"); and a in change capacity grading has been introduced, which requires countries to grade their capacity indicators in progressive levels from 1 to 5 as opposed to the previous "Yes/No/Not know" answers options. International Health Regulations (2005) Annual Reporting. Data is available through the Global Health Observatory Data Repository for 2010-2017	1
There are some limitations to considering these capacities as proxies of healthsystem adaptive capacity and system resilience. Most importantly, IHR monitoring questionnaires responses are self-reported. Secondly, the countries that report IHR implementation annually differ from year to year within these regional aggregate scores. Thirdly, IHR Core Capacity Requirements are not specific to climate change, and hence whilst they provide a proxy baseline, they do not directly measure a country's adaptive capacity in relation to climate driven risk changes. Fourthly, these findings capture potential capacity - not action. Finally, the quality of surveillance for early detection and warning is not shown and neither is the impact of that surveillance on public health. Response systems have been inadequate in numerous public health emergencies and thus the presence of such plans is not a proxy for their effectiveness. Nonetheless, these four capacities provide a useful starting point to consider the potential adaptive capacity of health systems globally.	1

A meta-analysis found having home air conditioning to be the strongest protective factor against heatwave-related mortality (pooled relative risk [RR] = 0.23; 95% confidence interval = 0.1 - 0.6; based on 6 studies) and having visited other air conditioned environments as the second most protective factor (pooled RR = 0.34; 95% confidence interval = 0.2 - 0.5; based on 5 studies).70 Thus, residential air conditioning is of special interest with regard to protection against heatwaverelated mortality. The prevented fraction is the percent reduction in an adverse health outcome due to a preventive exposure, compared with the scenario of complete absence of the exposure.71 The prevented fraction is determined by two factors: 1) the relative risk of the adverse health outcome in exposed persons compared with unexposed persons and 2) the prevalence of the exposure. The prevented fraction increases with decreasing relative risk and with increasing prevalence of exposure. The formula for prevented fraction is simply: Pe(1 - RR) Where Pe is the prevalence of the exposure and RR is the relative risk of the adverse health outcome in exposed persons compared with unexposed persons. For the air conditioning indicator, the prevented fraction is the percent reduction in heatwave-related deaths due to a given proportion of the population (Pac) having household air conditioning, compared with a scenario of complete absence of household air conditioning. Thus, the prevented fraction is simply: Pac(1 - RR) As intuitively expected, according to this formula, the higher the protection against heatwave-related mortality conferred by household air conditioning (i.e., the lower the relative risk of heatwave-related mortality in persons living in a household with air conditioning versus persons living in a household without air conditioning), the greater the prevented fraction; and the higher the proportion of the population with access to household air conditioning, the greater the prevented fraction. Pac was assumed to be the same as the proportion of households with air conditioning. These data were kindly provided by the International Energy Agency. Based on the meta-analysis mentioned above, an RR of 0.23 was assumed. Thus, the formula for prevented fraction is: 61	1
The prevented fraction could range from 0 for a region with no household air conditioning (i.e., Pac = 0) to 0.77 for a region in which every household has air conditioning (i.e., Pac = 1.0). A low prevented fraction does not necessarily translate into a high absolute number of heatwave-related deaths because in a given country/region the number of heatwave-related deaths that would occur in the complete absence of household air conditioning may be low. To estimate premature deaths from ambient PM2.5 due to electricity use for air conditioning, country/region-specific premature deaths due to PM2.5 emissions from power plants were estimated, as described in the appendix for Indicator 3.3.2. Then, country/region-specific data on final energy consumption from air conditioning, kindly provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA), was used to calculate the proportion of electricity generation used for air conditioning. This proportion was applied to the total premature deaths due to PM2.5 emissions from power plants to estimate the number of premature deaths due to air conditioning. Data	1
The IEA kindly provided data on the proportion of households with air conditioning (used for the prevented fraction calculation), CO2 emissions due to air conditioning (megatons), and final energy consumption for air conditioning (terawatt hours; used for the calculation of premature deaths due to PM2.5 from air conditioning) in the entire world and for major countries/regions.	1
For the prevented fraction calculation, an RR of 0.23 was assumed for heatwaverelated death for persons living in a household with air conditioning versus persons living in a household without air conditioning, based on a meta-analysis that included 6 studies, 4 from the United States and 2 from France. This RR may differ in other parts of the world. Furthermore, the proportion of households with air conditioning was used to estimate the proportion of the population having household air conditioning. The estimate did not take into account the size of households with versus without air conditioning or the vulnerability to heat stress of persons living in households with versus without air conditioning. Finally, data limitations prevented the estimation of the absolute number of heatwave-related deaths prevented by air conditioning. To estimate premature deaths due to PM2.5 emissions from air conditioning, it was assumed that in a given country/region, the electricity market is completely connected, so that the share of electricity used for air conditioning can be equally applied to power plant emissions throughout the country/region. This assumption may not be accurate for larger countries/regions.	1
The meta-analysis of the relationship between living with air conditioning and heatwave-related (or, more generally, heat-related) mortality will be updated. If there are sufficient studies, morbidity will also be examined. The indicator may be updated each year as new data becomes available. City-level case studies to estimate absolute number of lives saved from air conditioning versus premature deaths from exposure to PM2.5 due to air conditioning may also be performed. Additionally, national building codes, minimum energy performance standards and labeling rules for air conditioners, and progress on implementing the Kigali Amendment may be tracked in the future. 62	1

2: Adaptation, Planning, and Resilience for Health 2.4: Spending on adaptation for health and health-related activities The `Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change' dataset is the same data source that used in the 2017 and 2018 Lancet Countdown reports.1,72 It measures spending on economic activities related to adaptation and resilience to climate change. It was developed by data research firm kMatrix73 in partnership with numerous stakeholders, and includes the key adaptation measures identified by the IPCC. This classification of adaptation activities was originally developed from attempts by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to measure adaptation in 2009/201074. The definition of adaptation activities was extended through collaboration with the Greater London Authority in 2014, and updated through a project with Climate-KIC in 2017. This added several new industrial sectors as well as significantly expanding the activities under health and healthcare. The methodology used for data acquisition and analysis is based on a system called as `profiling', which was originally developed at Harvard Business School to track and analyse technical and industrial change.75 This is the basis for building taxonomies of economic activities and value chains, which can then be populated with estimates of key economic metrics like sales value and employment by triangulating transactional and operational business data to estimate economic values. This methodology is particularly valuable in areas where government statistics and standard industry classifications are not available.76 When measuring an industry or sector, the new taxonomy is	1
populated from the bottom up, searching for evidence for the ideal definition and including only economic activities where sufficient evidence is available. For each transaction listed in the adaptation economy data, a minimum of seven separate sources must independently record the transaction for it to be confirmed and included in the database. Triangulating data from multiple sources permits large volumes of unsorted, fragmented data of different types from different sources to be processed to arrive at more accurate estimates of transactional value that would not be possible using a single source. For the adaptation economy, data is produced to a confidence level of around 80%. Accessing and analysing multiple types of data is also key to identifying the `purpose' behind an economic activity, which is key for accurately assigning economic activities to the adaptation dataset. Developing the new definition of adaptation and resilience to climate change involved the top-down taxonomy of the entire `make and mend' economy, and then adaptation and resilience in all forms. Then these categories were filtered to isolate economic activities that can be strictly identified as being relevant to adaptation and resilience to climate change. The taxonomy of A&RCC is drawn from 11 sectors of the economy at-large: Agriculture & Forestry, Built Environment, Disaster Preparedness, Energy, Health/Health Care, ICT, Natural Environment, Professional Services, Transport, Waste and Water.74,77 There are a number of activities across different sectors that are `health-related' in the adaptation and resilience to climate change dataset, outside of the strictly-defined healthcare sector. The indicator design therefore required the definition of those activities from the other 10 sectors of the A&RCC data that can be clearly related to health, and thus should be included in a definition of `health-related' adaptation spending. The robust interim approach used for the 2017 and 2018 Lancet Countdown was again adopted for this year's Lancet Countdown. The 'health-related' activities consists of the activities of the Healthcare/Health Sector, Disaster Preparedness and Agriculture adaptation activities from the kMatrix dataset. A methodology is under development to define a full health-related adaptation definition across the entire A&RCC dataset, and an initial definition of an expanded health-related adaptation classification has been proposed.	1
Geographical Coverage: The A&RCC dataset has global coverage for 226 countries and territories. Data has been reported for a subset of countries and territories for whom adaptation spending data, regional and income classifications, and population estimates are available. This year's indicator covers 191 countries and territories with data reported in the A&RCC dataset, and that are assigned a region in the WHO regional classification and an income group in the World Bank income group classification.78 Per Capita values are based on 183 countries that also have population estimates from the IMF World Economic Outlook.79 Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change dataset: kMatrix Ltd, in partnership with University College London Comparison Data:	1
The classification of WHO Regions was taken from the WHO Data Repository Metadata.78 WHO metadata reports the World Bank Income Grouping values from 2018 (released 2018, based on 2017 calendar year data). 2015 to 2018 Population and GDP estimates from the April 2019 update of the IMF World Economic Outlook were used to calculate fiscal year values for 2015/16, 2016/17 and 2017/18.79	1
For comparability, global total values present the global total for countries or territories that are included in the regional and world bank analysis. It does not include the 35 countries and territories which have neither a WHO Region nor a World Bank Income Group. Most of these are overseas territories or subnational jurisdictions with relatively lower levels of adaptation spending. However, several larger states or jurisdictions that are not included in this global total are: Hong Kong, Taiwan and Puerto Rico. Economic activity or transactions are only measured where there is an economic `footprint', i.e. where there is transactional/financial data available to be measured. Therefore, public sector spending without an economic `footprint' (government spending on salaries, for example), cannot be measured. It also not possible to directly identify what percentage of measured spending is public versus private. Values are not currently adjusted for inflation. Values of sales generated are not directly comparable with values derived from national statistics. The reference period is the financial years 2015/16 to 2017/18. Further historical data could be available in the future. There will be three major developments in the future form of the indicator. The first will be the development of the `three-tier' definition of: 1) Adaptation activities with direct, important health impacts; 2) Those with less direct or more minor health impacts; 3) Those with no health impact or too tenuous a health impact. Secondly, in the future it is likely to possible to present historical data for the indicator, in order to provide trend data on change in spend over time. Finally, in the future the aim is to develop an indicator of adaptation spending as a percentage of the overall health sector spend and health-related spend as a percentage of the entire economy (represented by 24 industries), compiled using transactional data.	1
3: Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.1: Energy system and Health 3.1.1: Carbon intensity of the energy system This indicator contains two components: 1. Carbon intensity of the energy system, both at global and regional scales, (1972-2016), in tCO2/TJ; and 2. Global CO2 emissions from energy combustion by fuel, in GtCO2 (19722017). Global emissions without fuel breakdown are also provided for 2018. This sub-indicator is complimented by scenario values for 2050 of CO2 emissions. The technical definition of carbon intensity is the tonnes of CO emitted for each unit (TJ) of primary energy supplied. The rationale for the indicator choice is that carbon intensity of the energy system will provide information on the level of fossil fuel use, which has associated air pollution impacts. Higher intensity values indicate a more fossil dominated system, and one that is likely to have a higher coal share. As countries pursue climate mitigation goals, the carbon intensity is likely to reduce with benefits for air pollution. The indicator is calculated based on total CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion divided by Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES). TPES reflects the total amount of primary energy used in a specific country, accounting for the flow of energy imports and exports. The data is available for most countries of the world, for the period 1971-2016.	1
Future CO2 emissions for 2050 are taken from the IIASA hosted scenario database containing Integrated Assessment Model scenarios used in the IPCC SR1.5 report.80 This indicator is based on based on the IEA dataset, CO2 Emissions From Fuel Combustion: CO2 Indicators, accessed via the UK data service.81 Future emission values from Huppmann et al. 2018.80 The indicator does not provide information on the share of different fossil fuels, their use in different sectors, and the absolute levels of usage. These are all important elements in understanding the air pollution emissions, and their impacts. Therefore, additional indicators (3.1.2 & 3.1.3) provide additional complimentary information. This indicator will need to be updated to provide the data for the most recent years, which have seen important shifts in the use of fossil fuels, particularly coal. This year's report includes data to 2016, supplemented with additional statistics for 201782 and 2018,83 and shows that global emissions of CO2 from fuel combustion, having been flat between 2014-16, have increased since that period, reaching a new high of 33.1 GtCO2 in 2018.83 This 2.6% increase over the last two 68	1
years is due to continued growth in energy demand, most of which is met by fossil fuels. As shown in Figure 32 below, these emissions need to fall (from 2019) at a rate of around 7.4% every year to get to levels in 2050 consistent with the 1.5C target. The carbon intensity of the system also needs to reduce to near zero by 2050. In the last 15 years, carbon intensity has largely plateaued, as the growth of low carbon energy is insufficient to displace fossil fuels to start to bend the intensity curve downwards. In primary energy terms, low carbon energy accounted for 19% of total demand in 2018, down from 20% in 2000. Based on recent IEA data in the last couple of years, carbon intensity is reported to have reduced a small amount in the last couple of years due to displacement of coal by gas.83 The challenge of reducing CO2 emissions from the energy system, and achieve the resulting gains for global health, will require enormous political will and both supply and demand side policies. For example, even if all coal was removed from the power generation sector today and replaced with low carbon electricity, carbon intensity would reduce from approximately 57 to 41 tCO2/TJ, and emissions by about one-third. While reducing coal is key, the other sources of gas and oil in the system are critical to address.	1
3: Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.1: Energy system and health 3.1.2: Coal phase-out Two indicators are used here: 1. Total primary coal supply by region / country (in EJ units); and 2. Share of electricity generation from coal (% of total generation from coal). The first indicator is complimented by scenario values of coal use for 2050. These indicators are important to enable tracking of changes in coal consumption at a regional and country level. Due to the level of coal used for power generation, a second indicator tracks the contribution to electricity generation from coal power plants in selected countries. As countries pursue climate mitigation goals, the use of coal is likely to reduce with resulting benefits for air pollution. The indicator on primary energy coal supply is an aggregation of all coal types used across all sectors (from the IEA energy balances). The data is available for most countries of the world, for the period 1978-2017, with global data provided for 2018. The indicator on the share of electricity generation from coal is estimated based on electricity generated from coal plant as a percentage of total electricity generated. Regional data is available from 1990-2016, with global share estimated for 2017; pre-1990 data is not used due to incomplete time series. Countries or regions with large levels of coal use (as a share of generation, or in absolute terms), have been selected to show in the figures.	1
Future coal use and generation estimates for 2050 are taken from the IIASA hosted scenario database containing Integrated Assessment Model scenarios used in the IPCC SR1.5 report. This indicator is based on the extended energy balances from the International Energy Agency. The specific dataset is called World Extended Energy Balances, and is sourced via the UK data service.84	1
Future coal use values are based on scenarios are sourced from Huppmann et al. 2018.80 These indicators provide a proxy for air quality emissions associated with the combustion of coal. Further work is required to convert coal use by sector and type into emissions of different air quality pollutants. As per 3.1.1, this indicator will need to be updated to provide the data for the most recent years, which have seen important shifts in the use of coal. While the share of coal in primary energy continues to fall, the overall growth in global energy demand means coal has returned to a growth trajectory since 2016, 70	1
and continues to be the second largest contributor to global primary energy (after oil) and the largest source of electricity generation (at 38%, compared to gas, the next highest at 23%. Most of this growth is in the Asian region, notably in China, India and South-East Asia (Figure 33). Returning to the downward trend in coal demand and then accelerating will be critical to meeting the climate goals embodied in the Paris Agreement. As shown in Figure 34, to push towards the 1.5C target, coal use levels need to be at 23 EJ (median level) by 2050, compared to 157 EJ in 2017, reducing at a year-on-year rate of 5.6%. If coal is to be phased out, a key sector to tackle will be power generation, which accounted for an estimated 64% in 2017 of total coal use.82 Since 2016, coal generation has increased, while the share of generation remains at around 38%, as it has been since 2005 (Figure 33). Reductions in generation in other regions such as Europe and the USA have continued, but have been counterbalanced by increases in other regions. Using the scenarios that informed the IPCC SR1.5 report, rather than increasing, coal generation, a year-on-year reduction rate of 9% is required to achieve levels consistent with 1.5C pathways (Figure 35). For a global fleet of just over 2000 GW, almost half of which is in China, this requires a net reduction per year of 60 GW. It is worth noting that the UK has seen 20% year on year reductions in coal generation since 2010, highlighting what can be achieved albeit for a specific country.85 If coal phase-out can be sustained, it is likely to have significant air pollution cobenefits (Indicator 3.3), which in turn help offset the policy costs of mitigation. Some positive signs are emerging. First, a slowdown in capacity expansion, with a recent analysis by the Carbon Brief estimating only a net 20 GW increase in 2018.86 Second, other generation options are becoming cheaper than coal, notably solar, particularly in countries such as India. Finally, the metrics monitoring plants in the planning pipeline are all in decline, while retirements continue at pace in specific regions e.g. USA, UK.87 As outlined in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report,1 some political momentum has gathered, in pledging coal phase out, such as the countries in the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA).88 Crucial to the success of phasing coal out will be the policies in China and India, and the extent to which they will draw down on new investment, and start replacing existing capacity.	1
3: Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.1: Energy system and health 3.1.3: Zero-carbon emission electricity Two indicators are used here, and presented in two ways: 1. Total low carbon electricity generation, in absolute terms (TWh) and as a % share of total electricity generated (to include nuclear, and all renewables); and 2. Total renewable generation (excluding hydro), in TWh, and as a % share of total electricity generated. The increase in the use of low carbon and renewable energy for electricity generation will push other fossil fuels, such as coal, out of the mix over time, resulting in an improvement in air quality, with benefits to health. The renewables (excluding hydro) indicator has been used to allow for the tracking of rapidly emergent renewable technologies. For both indicators, generation, rather than capacity, has been chosen as a metric as the electricity generated from these technologies is what actually displaces fossil-based generation. Countries with large levels of low carbon generation (as shares, or in absolute terms), or with higher fossil dependency, have been selected. The data is again taken from the IEA extended energy balances.84 The absolute level indicators are total gross electricity generated aggregated from the relevant technology types. The share indicators are estimated as the low carbon or renewable generation as a % of total generation.	1
Future renewable energy use values are based on scenarios are sourced from Huppmann et al. 2018.80 This indicator set does not provide information on the air pollutant emissions displaced due to the increasing share of RE generation. This set should be developed to include an indicator to assess the direct impact on air quality emissions from additional low carbon generation, one approach being to compare the emission intensity of the current system with a counterfactual case, which does not have the additional share of RE generation. With the power sector accounting for 38% of total energy-related CO2 emissions, the importance of renewables for displacing fossil fuels is crucial. In 2016, low carbon electricity globally accounted for 32% of total global electricity, with continued gains in China (see main report). As costs continue to fall, solar generation continues to grow at remarkable rates of around 30% but still only accounts for 2% of total generation. The types of generation levels from renewables across 1.5C compliant scenarios are shown in Figure 36. It highlights that generation from new renewables (solar, wind, geothermal, ocean) need to increase by 9.7% per annum, to a level in 2050 that is larger than the total global generation today. Since 1990, the annual growth rate for these renewables was over 14%. To maintain the momentum in renewable generation growth, there is a need to ensure that all new generation growth is provided for by non-fossil fuel sources, with strong supply side policies to prevent investment in coal and gas.	1
3: Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.2: Access and use of clean energy The 2019 report presents a combination of data from both the Sustainable Development Goal 7, and fuel consumption in the residential sector produced by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Access to energy is defined by the IEA (2019) as: "a household having reliable and affordable access to both clean cooking facilities and to electricity, which is enough to supply a basic bundle of energy services initially, and then an increasing level of electricity over time to reach the regional average".89 Within SDG 7.1.2 (proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology) "Clean" fuels are defined by emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations included in the WHO guidelines for indoor air quality.90 This indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO. Estimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban and rural population for a given year are obtained separately using a multilevel model91 done at the country level. The use of energy in the residential sector is drawn from the IEA extended global residential modelling produced in the World Energy Outlook from the `World Extended Energy Balances' 2018 edition,84 which covers all countries or major regions in the world. The values are measured in PJ and cover all fuels consumed within the residential sector final energy demand. Here, at point of final energy demand, clean energy includes electricity (independent of generation source), solar thermal and geothermal.	1
This indicator quantifies contributions of individual source sectors to ambient PM2.5 exposure in cities worldwide. Coal has been highlighted as a fuel across all sectors. Estimates of sectoral source contributions to annual mean exposure to ambient PM2.5 were calculated using the GAINS model,94 which combines bottom-up emission calculations with atmospheric chemistry and dispersion coefficients. Energy statistics are taken from the IEA World Energy Outlook 2017,95 merged with GAINS information on application of emission control technologies and their emission factors. Atmospheric transfer coefficients are based on full year simulations with the EMEP Chemistry Transport Model96 at 0.5x0.5 resolution using meteorology of 2015 and include a downscaling to capture sub-grid urban concentration gradients for approximately 5000 cities over 100,000 inhabitants globally. Calculated ambient PM2.5 concentrations have been validated against in-situ observations from the latest version of the WHO's Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database (2016 update),97 and other sources where available (e.g. Chinese statistical yearbook). Also, numbers compare well with the SHUE dataset presented in Lancet Countdown 2018.1 For technical reasons, there are three deviations in the aggregation of countries versus the WHO regions: Sudan is included in the `African Region' here, but belongs to WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. Somalia is included in the `African Region' here, but belongs to WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. Algeria is included in the `Eastern Mediterranean' here, but belongs to WHO African Region.	1
An ideal indicator would provide a marker of benefits for air quality and/or health that are directly attributable to climate change mitigation action, which requires scenario analysis. Going beyond coal, a more explicit quantification of effects of fossil-fuel versus non-fossil fuel based activities could be undertaken.	1

Premature deaths from total ambient PM2.5 for regions other than Europe are calculated using the methodology of the WHO (2016) assessment on the burden of disease from ambient air pollution,99 which relies on disease specific integrated exposure response relationships (IERs) developed within the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study.100 Disease and age specific baseline mortality rates are taken from the GBD Results database.101 For Europe, this indicator follows the WHO Europe methodology and apply dose-response relationships for all-cause mortality among population over 30 years of age as reported under the REVIHAAP assessment.102 (WHO, 2013). Details are described in Kiesewetter et al. (2015).98 Attribution of estimated premature deaths from AAP to polluting sectors was done proportional to the contributions of individual sectors to population-weighted mean PM2.5 in each country. PM2.5 concentrations for 2008 and 2016 were applied to a fixed 2015 population to estimate the differences in PM2.5 attributable mortality due to emission changes only. For technical reasons, there are three deviations in the aggregation of countries compared with the WHO regions, as described for indicator 3.3.1. Caveats	1
The indicator relies on model calculations which are currently available for a limited set of regions (Europe, South Asia, East Asia). Uncertainty in the shape of integrated exposure-response relationships (IERs) make the quantification of health burden inherently uncertain. Different dose-response relationships are used for Europe (REVIHAAP, recommended by WHO-Europe) and Asia (WHO-Global). The non-linearity of the IERs used for non-European countries complicates the translation between the mortality burden attributed to an individual source, which is calculated proportional to the source contribution to ambient PM2.5, and the effect of mitigating this source. While a reduction of emissions would lead to a (roughly) proportional reduction of ambient PM2.5, this would not necessarily result in a proportional reduction of the health burden. In highly polluted environments, the health benefits of a marginal reduction of emissions would be disproportionately smaller than the relative change in concentrations.	1
Other health indicators than premature deaths should be included for a more complete assessment of the health burden, particularly Years of Life Lost (YLLs) and Years Lived with Disability (YLDs). An ideal indicator would provide a marker of benefits for air quality and/or health that are directly attributable to climate change mitigation action, which requires scenario analysis. Going beyond coal, a more explicit quantification of effects of fossil-fuel versus non-fossil fuel based activities could be undertaken.	1
3: Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.4: Sustainable and healthy transport This indicator contains two components: 1. Clean fuel use for transport; and 2. Cycling as a modal share of transport. Fuel use data (by fuel type) from the IEA datasets are divided by corresponding population statistics from the World Bank.	1
Data on travel mode shares from the TEMS tool was cross-referenced with cities that have signed up to the Charter of Brussels, an initiative to encourages cities to target a 15% bicycle modal share by 2020. The tool contains data on approximately 500 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, most of which are in Europe. Fuel use data is based on data from the IEA (2016), Global EB Outlook 2016: Beyond one million electric cars.103 Data on cycling mode shares obtained from The EPOMM Modal Split (TEMS) tool, developed by the European Platform on Mobility Management.104	1
The TEMS data provides estimates for broad mode types (car, public transport, bike, walk) for a limited number of cities only. The data record mode shares as trips rather than distances travelled. The data represent annual averages for a relatively limited number of years (the number of years of data varies between cities).	1
An ideal fuel use indicator would capture the direct health impacts of the use of transport fuels, with country- and urban-level specificity within the global coverage. In turn, the co-benefits of transitioning to lesspolluting fuels would be quantified directly in terms of reduced exposures to air pollution and their corresponding health impact. To more fully capture sustainable uptake a future indicator could collate information on the proportion of total distance travelled by different modes of transport based on comprehensive local survey data. Other data on sustainable travel infrastructure, for instance the presence of cycle schemes, would also be useful.	1
For livestock, data on stock numbers has been extracted from the FAO database, however, some data is missing for some years, most notably Somalia (missing data 2000-2011) for non-dairy cattle. Data on grazing emissions from small islands is also missing. The emission factors differ from FAO numbers: * For livestock, this is due to calculation of emissions of enteric fermentation, manure management and manure left on pasture at Globiom region (n=29) and livestock system (n=8) level whereas the FAO use subcontinental (n=9) and climatic level (n=3).106 * For crops, this is due to the FAO assuming slightly higher synthetic N application, greater manure N inputs, and a linear emissions factor of 1%, in contrast to a mean of 0.77% used by the nonlinear model of Carlson et al. (2017).108	1
The overall emissions from livestock has increased by 14% from 2000 to 2016. Enteric fermentation (67%) has the highest contribution to total livestock emissions, followed by manure management (17-18%), manure left on pasture (14%) and grassland fertilizer (1%) (Figure 40). The majority of the temporal increase in emissions is attributed to manure left on pasture, enteric fermentation and manure management which have increased by 17%, 15% and 12% respectively from 2000 to 2016, whereas the emissions from grassland fertilizer has only increased by 2%.	1
As ruminants emit methane via enteric fermentation they have the highest emissions of all livestock (93% of total). This is split between non-dairy cattle (62-65%), followed by dairy cattle (10-12%), goats and sheep (1011%) and buffalo (8%). Emissions from non-ruminants are divided between pigs (5%) and poultry (1-2%). The largest increase in emissions from 2000 to 2016 was poultry (58%), followed by non-dairy cattle (28%), small ruminant (23%), buffalo (22%), pigs (10%) and non-dairy (10%). The overall emissions from crops have increased by 10% from 2000 to 2016. Fertilizer (21-25%) has the lowest contribution to total crop emissions, followed by cultivation of organic soils (27-29%) and rice cultivation (4750%) (Figure 41). The majority of the temporal increase in emissions is attributed to emissions from fertilizer, which have increased by 30% from 2000 to 2016, whereas the emissions from rice and organic soil cultivation have only increased by 3% and 9%, respectively. As rice produces methane in addition to fertilizer application, it has the highest emissions of all crops (52-55% of total), followed by wheat (6-7%), maize (5%) and soybean (1%). The largest increase in emissions from 2000 to 2016 is attributed to wheat (21%), followed by maize (19%) and soybean (12%) whereas emissions from rice have only increased by 5%. The majority of the increases are due to fertilizer emissions which have increased by between 25 and 40% while emissions from cultivation of organic soils have only increased by between 0 and 2% for the named crops.	1

3: Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits 3.6: Healthcare sector emissions This indicator is in the form of healthcare-associated GHG emissions per capita per year. Results are calculated by assigning aggregate national health expenditures from WHO to final demand for `Health and Social Work' in the WIOD or EXIOBASE multi-region input-output (MRIO) models. Satellite environmental accounts are appended to each MRIO model, and GHG emissions are calculated using the standard Leontief inverse technique. This method provides an aggregate GHG emissions result for all types of healthcare expenditures. It is possible to produce a disaggregated estimate that differentiates among expenditure categories, such as hospitals, research, public health, and so on, as has been done for other national-level studies and a recent international comparison.109-112 One method to do this would be to use expenditure accounts that are themselves already disaggregated. The OECD provides disaggregated health expenditures, but this data set is limited in its geographic coverage. In order to maintain a global scope, WHO expenditure data was preferred, with the trade-off of reduced sector resolution. A second method to create disaggregated results would be to use the supply-use data embedded in the MRIO models themselves to determine expenditures of each national `Health and Social work' sector to all other sectors in the model, rather than relying on data that are independently reported to the WHO. This method has the advantage of high resolution but the disadvantage that Social Work expenditures would also be included, adding uncertainty to the results. A second disadvantage is that the WIOD and EXIOBASE only have full supply-use models for ~40 countries, which would again limit the geographic scope of the results. Other MRIO models such as EORA have higher granularity and covers 190 countries, but its environmental accounts only cover CO2 and not the other GHGs. Results for years after the MRIO model year are achieved through deflation of expenditure data. WIOD tables are in US dollars. For model years after 2011, 84	1
WHO expenditure data in current US dollars is deflated to $2011 using the US consumer price index from the World Bank. EXIOBASE tables are in euro. For model years after 2007, WHO expenditure data in current US dollars is converted to current national currencies using current market exchange rates, deflated in national currencies to 2007 using consumer price indices from the World Bank, and converted to 2007 using 2007 market exchange rates. Data	1
Environmentally extended multi-region input-output tables: * WIOD 2013 release with environmental accounts, latest model year 2011, latest emissions account year 2009, air emissions include CO2, CH4, N2O, NOx, SOx, CO, NMVOC, and NH3; * EXIOBASE version 2.2, latest model and emissions account year 2007, GHG emissions include CO2, CH4, N2O. This is not the most recent version of EXIOBASE, but was chosen as EXIOBASE 3.4 produced health care sector GHG emissions intensity results for the US in 2011 that were less than half of those of the national USEEIO model developed by the USEPA, a discrepancy that could not be reconciled. Per capita health expenditure data and health expenditure as % of national GDP is from the World Health Organization's Global Health Expenditure Database.113 Population data is also from the WHO.114 Market exchange rates are from UN Statistics Division.115 Consumer price indices are from the World Bank.116	1
As only total health expenditure data is available from WHO, all expenditures are assigned to Final Demand, with no separation for investment. MRIO models are retrospective and do not intrinsically account for changes in economic structure or emissions intensities (e.g., for electricity) that have occurred in the intervening period.	1
Results will not reflect individual healthcare systems' power purchase agreements for renewable energy; nor are emissions of waste anaesthetic gases, as these are not currently reported consistently to national governments and are not considered in environmental accounts. This indicator could be updated with improved EE-MRIO models in future years. For example, the addition of non-CO2 GHGs to the EORA full model would enable global coverage with additional resolution of expenditures within the healthcare sector. This is the first year that results are being presented for this indicator. Healthcare GHG emissions can be differentiated between those that occur domestically and those that occur in other countries. In the indictor results, countries also show wide variation in the location of healthcare GHG emissions, with the Russian Federation showing the highest proportion of emissions occurring domestically (88%) and Luxembourg showing the least (12%) (Figure 42).	1
4: Economics and Finance 4.1: Economic Losses due to Climate-Related Events The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report appendix.1 Munch Re NatCatSERVICE provided the data for this indicator.117 The NatCatSERVICE is a global database of natural catastrophe data. This has developed into one of the world's most comprehensive databases for information on natural catastrophe loss events. Data suitable for systematic and analytical evaluation on a worldwide scale are available from 1980 onwards. For this paper, data from 1990 are presented in order to align with the base year against which GHG emission reduction targets are commonly set. NatCatSERVICE collect a range of information for around 1,200 events each year. For this paper only data on direct economic loss (physical/tangible losses), insured losses (all paid-out insured physical/tangible losses) are used. Further information can be found in the online NatCatSERVICE Methodology document.118 Table 14: Peril classification as classified by NatCatSERVICE.118below illustrates the `peril classification' provided by NatCatSERVICE. Perils classified as Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological have been included in the analysis. Geophysical perils are excluded, due to their general independence from climate change. Table 14: Peril classification as classified by NatCatSERVICE.118 Family	1
Each natural catastrophe event recorded is assigned a direct economic loss, and where applicable, an insured loss. Where these are available, data is taken from official institutions, but where not, estimates are calculated. The process for estimation depends on what data is available. For example, if loss estimates from insurance market data is available, this data may be combined with data on insurance penetration and other event-specific information to estimate total economic losses. If only low-quality information is available, such as a description of the number of homes damaged or destroyed, assumptions on value and costs are made. Loss values are presented in US$, or if initially expressed in local currency, converted to US$ using the market exchange rates at the end of the month when the event occurred. Once data was received from the NatCatSERVICE economic losses (insured and uninsured) were divided by annual GDP values for each income grouping, sourced from the World Bank Database. Loss values for 1990-2016 were provided by MunichRe in US$2016 terms. GDP data taken from the World Bank Database were inflated to US$2016 terms to carry out the losses/$1000 GDP calculation. For 2017 onwards, data for both economic losses and GDP are sourced in current terms. For this paper, updated GDP values for 2016, 2017 and 2018 have been used. Munch Re NatCatSERVICE.117 An ideal form of this indicator would allow attribution of fatalities and economic losses to events induced by climate change. However, such attribution is unlikely to be feasible over the course of the Lancet Countdown. As such, it is not envisaged that this indicator will significantly alter.

4: Economics and Finance 4.2: Economic costs of air pollution This indicator is based on estimates of total Years of Life Lost (YLL) in each member state of the European Union, resulting from PM2.5 exposure from emissions anthropogenic sources, assuming consistent levels of emissions and subsequent population exposure to 2115, integrated across the lifetime of the population present in 2015. The calculations are performed by the GAINS integrated assessment model (see Kiesewetter et al (2015) for a full description of the model and how YOLLs are estimated.98 -	1
YLLs are calculated based on the loss of life expectancy from all-cause mortality from ambient PM2.5 exposure resulting from anthropogenic sources, using dose-response relationships following the WHO Europe methodology,102 with population cohort exposure kept constant across lifetimes Calculations are based on the population structure present in 2010, using data extracted from UN life tables. However, 2015 population numbers are used to calculate total YLLs from the calculated reduction in life expectancies. 90	1
Increased health risk from PM2.5 exposure occurs once population cohorts reach 30 years old with younger cohorts only included once they reach this age, (maximum age = 100). Consequences for new additions to the population are not considered. Energy production and consumption statistics are taken from the IEA Energy statistics are taken from the IEA World Energy Outlook 2017,95 merged with GAINS information on application of emission control technologies and their emission factors.	1
Total YLLs in each country and year are then multiplied by an estimated `Value of a Life Year' (VLY), which is taken to be 50,000 for all countries, for all population cohorts, following the lower bound estimate suggested by Part III of the 2009 European Union Impact Assessment Guidelines.119 Average annual values are then calculated by dividing the product of this calculation by 100. Data	1
Energy statistics are taken from the IEA World Energy Outlook 201795 merged with GAINS information on application of emission control technologies and their emission factors. Calculations for Europe are described in detail by Kiesewetter et al. (2015).98	1
There is relatively little literature attempting to estimate a VLY, and with such literature that does exist largely focussing on European countries. The value employed by this indicator (50,000) is the lower bound estimate suggested for use by the 2009 European Union Impact Assessment Guidelines, with the upper value set at 100,000. As such, it is possible that the values presented by this indicator are conservative, however given the relative lack of evidence and complexity in producing estimates for VOLYs, it is difficult to make such a conclusion with confidence. In future, this indicator will be developed to reflect the actual economic value of health consequences of annual changes in PM2.5 exposure, rather than of reduced life expectancy from assumed constancy of exposure across lifetimes. The indicator may also be expanded to cover areas outside the European Union.	1
4: Economics and Finance 4.3: Investing in a low-carbon economy 4.3.1: Investment in new coal capacity The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report appendix,1 however the IEA definition of investment has changed, as described below. The data on investment in new coal-fired electricity generation capacity is sourced from the annual IEA World Energy Investment publication.120 The revised approach from IEA considers `ongoing' capital spending, with investment in a new plant spread evenly from the year new construction begins, to the year it becomes operational. Previously, data were presented as `overnight' investment, in which all capital spending on a new plant is assigned to the year in which the plant became operational. IEA World Energy Investment publication.120 Due to updated methodology, values presented here differ from those presented in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report.1 A comparison of investment in new coal-fired electricity generation capacity using the new methodology compared with the old methodology is presented in the main report.	1
Table 17: Annual investment in coal-fired capacity from 2006 to 2018 (an index score of 100 corresponds to 2006 levels). Year Index (100 = 2006) 2006 100 2007 108 2008 114 2009 122 2010 128 2011 130 2012 123 2013 111 2014 103 2015 96 2016 87 2017 81 2018 79	1
For most sectors, `investment' is defined as ongoing capital spending on assets. For some sectors, such as power generation, this investment is spread out evenly from the year in which a new plant or upgrade of an existing one begins its construction to the year in which it becomes operational. For other sources, such as upstream oil and gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, investment reflects the capital spending incurred over time as production from a new source ramps up or to maintain output from an existing asset. This definition applies to (updated) 2017 and 2018 data, and differs from the definition previously employed by the IEA, in which investment was defined as overnight capital expenditure. For energy efficiency, `investment' is defined as incremental spending by companies, governments and individuals to acquire equipment that consumes less energy than that which they would otherwise have bought. This definition remains unchanged. Other areas of expenditure, including operation and maintenance, research and development, financing costs, mergers and acquisitions or public markets transactions, are not included. Investment estimates are derived from IEA data for energy demand, supply and trade, and estimates of unit capacity costs, For more information, see IEA (2019).120 Data IEA World Energy Investment publication.120 Additional Values presented below are in US$2018, billion. 2017 values have been updated Information from those reported in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report,1 due to improved data.

In addition, the Health Alliance on Climate Change has been removed from the data (as no explicit divestment commitment has been made). Divestment commitments by the American Medical Association, which divested in 2018, was not included in the data provided by 350.org, and was added separately. Data	1
4: Economics and finance 4.4: Pricing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels 4.4.1: Fossil fuel subsidies The data on fossil fuel consumption subsidies for this indicator is taken from the IEA,125 and is calculated using the price-gap approach, for 42 mostly non-OECD countries (see data below). The `price-gap' approach is the most commonly applied methodology for quantifying consumption subsidies. It compares average end-user prices paid by consumers with reference prices that correspond to the full cost of supply. The price gap is the amount by which an end-use price falls short of the reference price and its existence indicates the presence of a subsidy. Prices are presented in US$2018. Original data and a further description of the calculation methodology can be obtained from the IEA (2019).125 Data for historic years have altered compared to the 2018 Lancet Countdown report1 due to improved information (including availability of data for 2008 and 2017).	1
4: Economics and finance 4.4: Pricing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels 4.4.2: Coverage and strength of carbon pricing The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report appendix.1 The World Bank provides the data for this indicator, through the interactive Carbon Pricing Dashboard.126 Prices are those as of 1st August 2016, 1st December 2017, and 1st April 2018, and 1st April 2019, respectively. For 2019, the indicator includes only instruments that had been introduced by 1st April 2019. Baseline-and-credit systems are excluded from the analysis. GHG coverage data is presented as a proportion of 2012 global anthropogenic GHG emissions (53, 937 MTCO2e) as calculated by EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research).127 Monetary values are presented in US$, in current prices. Here data is presented for 2018 and 2019. See the 2018 Lancet Countdown report for 2017 data.1	1
World Bank Carbon Pricing Dashboard.126 Instrument coverage of GHG emissions, in both absolute and proportional term, are based on total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2012 - the last year in which consistent data was available. `Baseline and Credit' instruments are not included due to a lack of price data. Some instruments experience an overlap in coverage. For example, the UK Carbon Price Floor applies to the power sector in the UK, which is also subject to carbon pricing under the EU ETS. Other instruments experience partial overlap. As such, total emissions coverage is likely to be overestimated (ceteris paribus), although this effect is likely to be minor (<2.5% total coverage). The price used to calculate the weighted average prices are the prevailing prices on a single day. The prices for many instruments (particularly ETS instruments) are likely to alter over the course of a year, however the effect on the final summary values is likely to be minor. Prices are presented in current values. As with Indicator 4.4.1, an ideal future form of this indicator would have two key elements. The first element would be the consistent inclusion of production and consumption subsidies for all countries, available on an annual basis. The second element would be the use of this data, along with that of carbon pricing data (see Indicator 4.4.2), to create a `net carbon price' indicator. The future practicality of this indicator will depend on the availability of data at the appropriate level of granularity.

4: Economics and finance 4.4: Pricing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels 4.4.3: Use of carbon pricing revenues The methodology for this indicator remains the same as described in the 2018 Lancet Countdown report appendix.1 Data on revenue generated is provided by the World Bank's interactive `Carbon Pricing Dashboard'.126	1
The method of revenue expenditure classification is adapted from Carl and Fedor (2016).128 Definitions and assumptions regarding the categories as applied in this paper are as follows: *	1
Climate Change Mitigation - revenues are explicitly allocated to activities or infrastructure that seeks to reduce, or enable the reduction, of greenhouse gas emissions, from any source, within or outside of the sectors or jurisdiction in which the carbon price is applied; Climate Change Adaptation - as above, but for adaptation activities or infrastructure; Revenue Recycling - revenues are explicitly returned to some broad portion of the population through individual or business tax rate cuts, tax eliminations, or rebates in order to achieve broad revenue neutrality. Revenue returned to directly compensate for the cost of GHG emissions (through free permit allocation or targeted assistance for energy-intensive, trade-exposed firms) are not included); General Funds - revenues are explicitly used for purposes other than those described above, or the use of revenues is unspecified or information is unavailable.	1
Only revenue that may be considered government income is included. For example, revenue generated by sale of permits issued to utilities under the Californian cap and trade instrument, which much then be used to finance discounts on household energy bills through `carbon credits', are not considered, as this revenue does not pass through the State government. Instruments for which price data is not available, either due to the type of instrument or simply lack of data, are not included. Other assumptions as applied to individual instruments are noted in the table below. Data	1

5: Public and Political Engagement 5.1: Media engagement in health and climate change 5.1.1: Trends in global media coverage of health and climate change Intersecting trends in coverage of climate change and health were identified in 62 selected newspaper sources from January 2007 through December 2018. The 62 sources are located 36 countries spanning six World Health Organization (WHO) regions around the world: African Region, Region of the Americas, South-East Asia Region, European Region, Eastern Mediterranean Region, and Western Pacific Region. These sources were monitored through Nexis Uni, Proquest and Factiva databases accessed via the University of Colorado libraries. The searches were conducted with the following key words in English, Spanish, Portuguese and German respectively: *	1

After considerable deliberation and discussion, for the 2019 report the full search set was recoded for 2017-2018, removing the search term `temperature'. This improvement was made because it was through comparative analyses that this term often generated an additional hit, but articles were addressing a fever related to some illness, rather than climate change or global warming. Additional false positives were also identified through verification checks, comparing search functions across the databases. It was found that different databases ran the same search string differently. Therefore, search string grammar was revised such that all databases would use the same criteria with which to perform the search and return articles. This eliminated a significant portion of articles which did not address or mention health and climate change together. Additional verification checks were also performed to generate adjustment factors and to attempt to gain some insight into the rates and types of false positives remaining in the data. Due to the size and scope of the dataset, a full manual search is not possible. Therefore, these checks were performed by taking a systematic random sample of articles from each year, from a selection of newspapers within each region. The adjustment factors were generated to take into account the rates of complete mis-identification of articles based on the sample analysed; for example, a common mis-hit is where an article discusses growing plants in a `greenhouse' and also discusses plant `diseases.' The adjustments factors were then applied at the WHO regional level. Analysis found different rates of these types of mis-hits for each region as follows: Africa 19%, Americas 31%, Southeast Asia 28%, Europe 39%, Eastern Mediterranean 14%, Western Pacific 43%. These rates are preliminary and future work will include continuing to revise and refine these adjustment factors.	1
Due to the use of these adjustment factors and the revised search methods, the 2019 Lancet Countdown report provides a more robust assessment of climate change/global warming and public health indicators. This indicator uses data from 62 sources in 36 countries around the world over 12 years, from January 2007 through December 2018, collected and cured by the Media and Climate Chane Observatory (MeCCO) of the University of Colorado. As noted above, the MeCCO team improved the search and generated adjustment factors in order to reduce noise in search returns. This has reduced the chances of incorrectly identifying conjoint references to health and climate change in newspaper articles. This has confronted caveats articulated in previous reports1,131	1
and has strengthened this monitoring validity in the 2019 Lancet Countdown report. Nonetheless, by continuing to monitor newspapers around the world (rather than, for example, television or radio) the explanatory power across all `media coverage' remains limited. There also remain concerns with the degree to which the databases return hits of duplicate articles which are not warranted (i.e. are not actually the same article reproduced elsewhere but rather are simply two entries in the database for a single article) and with the degree to which the articles are engaging with health and climate change as integrated issues of concern. The analysis examining false positives revealed high variability in the occurrence of duplicate articles across time and newspapers and as such was not included in the adjustment factors.	1
The analysis also indicated that a significant portion of articles, anywhere between 40-60% across regions, may mention both climate change and health but do not deeply engage with them as integrated issues. However, tracking this coverage remains informative because it gives an idea of how comparable the issues are on the public agenda and in public awareness; as such, and due to the very high variability across newspapers, it is not included in the adjustment factors. Possible further expansion into television and radio, pending data availability. The precision of this indicator will continue to be improved. Coverage of climate change and public health tracks relatively consistently with several trends in media coverage of climate change or global warming more generally, where political, scientific, cultural, ecological and meteorological themes provide news hooks for stories over time (Figure 44). Coverage of total articles has gone up 39% overall across all regions from 20152018 compared to 2011-2014. With some monthly upticks associated with the particularly high-profile United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conferences of Parties (COPs), climate change negotiations in 2009 and 2015, this data indicate a gradual trend toward more sustained attention to climate change and public health in the public arena over time.	1

5: Public and Political Engagement 5.1: Media engagement in health and climate change 5.1.2: Media coverage of health and climate change for People's Daily in China Six steps to filter the articles, as shown below: 1. Key words for the topics of (a) Health, and (b) Climate Change were identified as shown in Table 23.	1
2. The articles in the Database of People's Daily ( were searched from January, 2008 to December, 2018, which contained any of the key words in the column of "Climate Change" in Table 23. The distribution of articles with the key words in different years is shown in Figure 45.	1
Figure 45: Number of articles identified from People's Daily database by inputting key words from topic Climate Change. People's Daily 3. The selected articles were processed from step 2 for the filtration in step 4. This step is based on a natural language processing (NLP) method to transform the articles into the format that is ready to input into the model. The two main NLP methods used in this step is Word Segmentation and Removing stop words. In this step, it regulated the format of Chinese words to reduce recognition ambiguity resulting from this format. 4. Filtration was performed to identify the real topic of each article preprocessed in step 3. The real topic was represented by the proportion of each topic in the individual article. Technically, a classic algorithm in NLP, called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used in this process. LDA is an algorithm to extract the topic of articles. In the LDA algorithm, the number of topics that extracted can be set by the operator.143 Each topic is composed by the key words, such as, the key words in Table 23 for the topic of "Climate Change". The number of topics was set as 15, including 111	1
"Climate Change", "Health", and "other" (13). The other 13 were extracted from the articles from the model as the result of the highest frequency topics. The number of articles identified as containing the real topic "Climate Change" is shown as blue line in Figure 45. Since the composition of each article is represented by the probability of the corresponding topics, a probability threshold was set. If the topic, which is Climate Change or Health, in an article is larger than the threshold, the article was classified as containing the topic. After the filtration, the articles classified as containing both topics became the articles that contain both "Health" and "Climate Change," individually at a probability greater than 0.5% .Therefore, this step filtered out the non-relevant or low-relevance articles with respect to "Climate Change" and both "Health" and "Climate Change". The number of articles focusing on climate change after step 4 between 2008 and 2018 is shown as the dotted blue line in Figure 46. 5. The articles were further filtered based on their relevance of both "Climate change" and "Health", since containing "Climate Change" and "Health" separately is different to covering the topic "Health and Climate Change". To start the filtration, the key words in the articles were labelled with number "1"to represent the "Climate Change" key words and number "2" to represent the "Health" key words. For every word labelled "1", the nearest key word labelled "2" was found. Then, the distance between labelled words was counted. If the distance between the word labelled "1" and the nearest word labelled "2" was less than or equal to threshold 50, it was marked as focusing on Health and Climate Change in this step. In Chinese sentences, the distance of 50 is about 3 to 4 sentences. So, if the gap between two topic words is more that 3-4 sentences, the two topic words were considered as non-related. The number of articles focusing on both Health and Climate Change between 2008 and 2018 is shown as the black line in Figure 46: Number of articles reporting of climate change (dotted blue line) and number of articles reporting of both health and climate change after the relevance check in People's Daily (black line)..	1

People's DailyThe filtered articles were manually screened. If the manual screening confirmed that the topic was "Health and Climate Change", it was retained. The red line in Figure 47 shows the selected articles after the manual screening. People's Daily The criteria used in the manual screen are described below.	1

All the articles from 2008 to the present published on People's Daily (from the official website of People's Daily).144 Across the period 2008-18, 74 articles in total were identified as "Health and Climate Change" related, which was one-third of the articles filtered. This manual screening stage removed mainly four types of articles identified through the first five steps: 1. The key word from the topic of "Health" might refer to the health of animals and the health of the environment; for example, the topic of the article is climate change and ecosystem health rather than climate change and human health. 23 articles were excluded for this reason. 2. The article lists some facts, such as a recent increase in the prevalence of a certain disease. But the reason why is uncertain, climate change/environmental change is one of the conjectures. 16 articles were excluded for this reason. 3. The key word "Climate Change" refers to short-term weather or temperature variation, but not the long-term trends of global climate change. 23 articles were excluded for this reason. 4. The article has mentioned human health change and climate change in one or two sentences, but the topic of the article is of low relevance to the combined topic of "Health and Climate Change". 46 articles were excluded for this reason 5. The article includes the key words and meets the other selection criteria, but the combined topic of health and climate is not addressed. 12 articles were excluded for this reason Note: the figure in the 2019 Lancet Countdown report includes categories 2-4. This is for reasons of comparability with other analyses where there was a less extensive process of manual screening. It was also noted in Figure 47 that the number of articles on Climate Change was highest in 2010 and also comparatively higher in 2016, both having a time lag behind the important COPs in 2009 and 2015. This time lag is attributed to the tendency in the People's Daily to report climate change and to discuss the conference outcomes after the important COPs were held (which are usually held in December).

5: Public and Political Engagement 5.1: Media engagement in health and climate change 5.1.3: Content of coverage in US and Indian newspapers This new indicator extends the capacity to track media engagement by focusing on the content of media coverage of health and climate change, enabling further understanding about what is being reported, as well as the levels of coverage. Media sources and timeframe This indicator focuses on the elite media in two countries, representing very different contexts. Two newspapers from India and two from the US were 117	1
selected; Hindustan Times (HT), Times of India (TOI), Washington Post (WP), and New York Times (NYT). The focus of analysis was narrowed for articles to two time periods during 2018. First, the time period July to September (inclusive) for both the Indian and US sources was considered. This time period was used as it covers a period of extreme weather events in both regions; wildfires in the US and monsoon flooding in India. This enabled consideration of media reporting in light of these events, and the ways in which links may be made through them to climate change and health. Second, reporting during November to December 2018 was considered. This time period covers the lead up to and hosting of the COPs. In addition, this covers the time period during which findings from the Lancet Countdown report itself have been reported in the media. Search terms Media articles were obtained in conjunction with Indicator 5.1.1 (trends in media coverage). Search terms developed by this team of researchers, designed to return articles at the intersection of health and climate change were used. For identification of articles in the Indian media (HT and TOI), the Factiva database was used. For identification of articles in the US media (WP and NYT), the Nexis database was used. Articles in which appeared a minimum of one key search term from both (a) health, and (b) climate change were identified Error! Reference source not found.. Table 25: Search terms for Health and Climate Change Health terms 	1
Pre-screening of articles The articles across the five months and four media sources were prescreened in order to ensure that only those making meaningful connections between health and climate change were retained for further analysis. The procedure used to select articles was as follows: a. An article must make a meaningful connection between health and climate change. This can be made explicitly, or implied through the narrative used, but health topics and climate change aspects must be clearly linked to be included. b. Articles were retained when any reference is made to health and climate change that meets criterion (a). This may include long articles where only passing reference is made to the link, as well as articles where the focus is more substantial. c. Where reference to air pollution is made, it was not deemed to meet the criterion (a) unless an explicit or implicit link was made to health. For example, an article that covers the need for coal-fired plants to close in order to meet climate change targets and reduce air pollution, was not retained unless a link was also made to the health impacts of either air pollution or climate change. It was not enough simply to reference air pollution in the context of climate change for this to be deemed reference to `health'. Some articles coded (c) have been included as borderline cases. In order to carry out pre-screening in a systematic manner, the following approach was adopted: *	1
Having pre-screened the articles, a dataset of 248 articles was retained across the four media sources. Development of coding framework In order to identify recurrent and discrete themes within media reporting, a version of `template analysis'145 was used,which allows for both deductive coding (a priori themes of interest to be specified in advance) and inductive coding (themes are incorporated based on prevalent or recurrent topics detected in the data). So as to align the thematic coding to the wider Lancet Countdown report, a priori codes were derived from pre-existing indicators. Themes from Working Group 1 and Working Group 2 were particularly drawn upon. An iterative process was used to refine the coding framework, whereby samples of articles were test-coded, with the suitability of thematic categories repeatedly revisited until both coders were satisfied that these provided a fair representation of the themes evident across the media articles. Both coders independently coded all articles, allowing for multiple codes to be assigned where appropriate (for example, where an article referred both to health impacts and co-benefits). Instances where discrepancies arose were reconciled through agreement between the two coders. The final framework incorporated the following codes/themes: *	1
Health impacts of climate change; specifically: * Generic/ non-specific health impacts * Heatwaves and temperature increase * Precipitation extremes * Wildfires * Disease * Food security/ malnutrition Population displacement * Mental health * Other impacts * Co-benefits and co-hazards; specifically: * Generic/ non-specific co-benefits * Air pollution (transport) * Air pollution (energy) * Air pollution (non-specific or generic) * Food/ diet * Other co-benefits and co-hazards * Adaptation; specifically: * Generic adaptation 120	1
Newspaper articles in Hindustan Times, Times of India, New York Times, Washington Post. Articles analysed during time period July to September, and November to December. The data used is the full text of media articles. This cannot be made publicly available due to copyright restrictions, however the full search strings applied and databases used are detailed above. The content analysis is able to provide a broad picture of how health and climate change are being reported in the target news sources and time points. The selected newspapers cannot be taken to be representative of reporting across the two countries (US and India) or the WHO regions in which they are located, given that different media sources are known to have widely diverging positions on climate change. The coding framework used is intended to identify themes in reporting at the intersection of health and climate change; it is not intended to provide insights into the more general ways in which climate change and/or health is reported in news media.	1
Because the content analysis used search terms provided by the global media tracker developed by the MeCCO team for its analysis of trends in newspaper coverage, the articles returned are necessarily those in which there was found to be a conjunction of a pre-selected health term and climate change term. The exact search terms used are likely to have influenced the types of articles obtained. For example, the bank of returned articles available to the content analysis was already set up in such a way that an air pollution and climate change co-occurrence was present in many places. Analyses of the content of coverage will form part of the Working Group's future programme of work. The analysis for the 2019 Lancet Countdown report will therefore enable the indicator to be refined (e.g. its thematic structure) and extended (e.g. to other countries and newspapers) for future Lancet Countdown reports.

5: Public and Political Engagement 5.2: Individual engagement in health and climate change This new indicator provides an individual-level indicator of public engagement. It tracks engagement with climate change and health through people's usage of the online encyclopaedia, Wikipedia. Over the years, Wikipedia has grown to be a major and trusted source of information that has outpaced traditional encyclopaedias in terms of reach, coverage, and comprehensiveness.146 It is regularly listed among the ten most-visited websites worldwide.147 The English edition covers more than five million articles and over 130,000 active editors. People around the world use it to engage in topics they are interested in. Fortunately, the traffic that goes to Wikipedia - and even that which goes to individual articles of the encyclopaedia - can be analysed over time because the Wikimedia foundation makes these statistics available to everyone for free. This makes it a global indicator of what people pay attention to on a daily basis. The indicator To investigate to what extent people do not only pay attention to climate change and human health in isolation, but also to the connection between both, this indicator draws on clickstream statistics from the English Wikipedia. Clickstream refers to a dataset provided by the Wikimedia foundation.148 It reports "streams of clicks", or in other words, how people get to a Wikipedia article, and 127	1
what links they click on. This is reported on a monthly basis and in pairs of resources, the first being where the visit came from, the second which page was visited. For instance, in the data for 2018, people who visited the page on Global warming followed the link to the article on Climate change 17,791 times. This gives an indicator of monthly-level global attention towards one issue (if both articles are representative of the same issue) or two issues (if articles come from different domains, such as climate change and health). By looking at climate change - health articles pairs, an indicator of attention towards climate change consequences for human health over time is generated. Measurement strategy The approach to using clickstream data as an indicator of public engagement in climate change and health is based on the following premises: (1) The Wikipedia platform is a globally used source for information on a multitude of topics;149 (2) Citizens use the platform to inform themselves about topics they are interested in; (3) By tracking engagement with Wikipedia, articles that are related to climate change as wells as with articles on health, it is possible to identify public engagement with the relationship between both topics. The following behavioural patterns are relevant for the validity of the measure as a proxy for public engagement with climate change and health: (a) A person is generally interested in the nexus between climate change and public health and informs her/himself about the topic online by, e.g., reading the Wikipedia article on Effects of global warming on human health.150 (b) A person is interested in climate change and the consumption of information about the topic then sparks interest in its consequences for human health. For instance, the person reads the article on Global warming151 and then turns to the article on Malnutrition.152) (c) A person is interested in a certain aspect of human health or consequences of climate change with an immediate impact on human health, and then turns its attention to climate change issues. For instance, the person reads the article on Malaria153 () and then turns to the article on Global warming.151 Indicator construction In order to use the Wikipedia viewership statistics as a proxy for public engagement with climate change and health, it is key to select articles that are representative of these topics. To generate the populations of articles related to climate change on the one hand and health on the other, a semi-automated approach was implemented. Based on an initial set of keywords,1 related articles were searched for, using the internal Wikipedia search.	1
For climate change articles, the keywords were climate change, warming, ipcc, and green house, and greenhouse. For health articles, the seed keywords were epidemy, disease, malaria, diarrhoea, infection, sars, measles, pneumonia, epidemic, pandemic, public health, health care, healthcare, epidemiology, mortality, morbidity, nutrition, illness, infectious, ncd, non-communicable disease, noncommunicable disease, communicable disease, air pollution, nutrition, malnutrition, mental disorder, and stunting. 1	1
For each search using one of the keywords, the first 100 results that led to an article with a minimum word count of 300 were then extracted and identified, ensuring that the articles that were chosen as seed articles had been given a certain degree of attention by Wikipedia editors, therefore being more likely to link to other relevant articles. Next, the articles collected were screened via the Wikipedia search for categories, which were used on the Wikipedia to categorise pages in a meaningful way (e.g., using categories such as Climate change or Effects of global warming). Those categories were then themselves screened for relevant articles. All additional articles were once more filtered such that those with a title matching one of the initial keywords were chosen. For the health-related articles, several articles that turned out to be irrelevant for purposes of the indicator were excluded manually. Health topics are covered extensively on the Wikipedia, articles and topics that, in principle, could be related to climate change were prioritised. In addition, the variety of links to further health-related articles on the effects of global warming Wikipedia page150 were exploited. This list can be viewed as a curated list of relevant health articles. All in all, 237 articles related to climate change and 825 articles related to health were identified as being representative for either of the issues. The complete list of articles is listed below. For the clickstream analysis, the set of articles was extended by also taking "second-level pages" into account, that is pages that are linked to in the set of 237 climate change or 825 health articles and that are also somewhat related to climate change or health. Sometimes, people might not directly jump from one of the major articles on climate change to another one on health, but travel through an intermediary page (e.g., a possible individual stream of clicks could be: Climate change  Human impact on the environment  Respiratory disease). The clickstream data only allowed identification of click volume for pairs of articles, but by extending the network, clickstreams involving relevant pages that are linked in the original set of articles could also be captured. After taking these additional articles into account, 1040 articles related to climate change and 2865 articles related to health were identified. Data	1
This indicator draws on publicly available data from the Wikimedia foundation. Data from all platforms, i.e. accesses to the Wikipedia via desktop machines, mobile browsers, and mobile apps was considered. The clickstream data were downloaded from the Wikimedia Dumps.154 Spider traffic (i.e. traffic generated by automated bots crawling the platform) was excluded. Referer-resource pairs (i.e. the pairs of the article of origin and the target article) that had less than 10 clicks were removed in the original dataset, the actual clickstream traffic is likely to be underreported. However, this is not expected to add any systematic bias, in particular since the focus of the indicator is mainly in changes of engagement over time. Clickstream data is available from November 2017 onwards. This indicator exclusively focuses on data from 2018 in the 2019 Lancet Countdown report. The analyses are limited to the English Wikipedia. The benefits of the Wikipedia usage metadata for the purpose of tracking public engagement in climate change and health are that this data: (a) is globally 129	1
All clickstream information is only available at the aggregate level. It is not possible to link the data to information about individuals who visited the platform. Also, the data is not geo-referenced, so it is not possible to infer where page visits came from. Although the English Wikipedia is predominantly used in English-speaking countries (according to the Wikimedia Traffic Analysis Report,155 about 40% of the traffic on the English Wikipedia comes from the US), it is a globally popular resource. It makes up for 50% of the global traffic to all Wikipedia language editions. Therefore, it can be seen as a global indicator of public attention that is somewhat biased towards attention from countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, India, Canada, and Australia. Extending the analyses to other language editions will help to remedy this bias and uncover potential geographic engagement heterogeneity in the future. More generally, the measure represents an online proxy for an offline phenomenon. In addition, it is sensitive towards the selection of articles used to capture engagement. The global popularity of the platform, which consistently ranks among the ten most visited websites worldwide, speaks in favour of its usefulness for this application. However, more direct indicators of public engagement, such as survey-based measures, might provide a useful supplement and source for validation in the future. While the data is available for free, access to future data depends on the Wikimedia API. There is no indication of Wikimedia restricting access in the future. Instead, Wikimedia has invested in data quality and making access more robust and convenient.	1
In future reports, this indicator will have increased precision, scope, and value. First, the number of articles used will be increased. With an ever-growing Wikipedia, more relevant articles might become available This requires a joint automated and human classification effort to ensure that the coverage of relevant articles (true positives) is as large as possible and the number of irrelevant articles (false positives) in the sample minimal. Second, the data collection and analysis efforts will be extended to other language editions (both for the pageviews and the clickstream data). This would make it possible to track more fine-grained trends at the regional level. It is likely that there is heterogeneity in public engagement in climate change and health, as different regions of the world are currently affected by health consequences of climate change to varying degrees. Studying engagement in different language versions of the Wikipedia could at least partly pick up this heterogeneity. Third, the analyses with related event data will be enriched. It is plausible to assume and could already be partly shown that public engagement is sensitive towards events, such as extreme weather events or epidemics, but also political	1
and scientific activity such as the COPs or the publication of IPCC reports and protests such as the School Strikes for Climate. Fourth, complementary data to track and validate public attention, such as survey, experimental, and other online data will be explored. Beyond the 2019 Lancet Countdown report, analyses of individual-level engagement will be undertaken, using pageview data from Wikimedia. In time, this indicator may draw on both clickstream and pageview data. Additional information	1

Additional analyses Complementing the analysis presented in the 2019 Lancet Countdown report, the Figures below provide the standalone network plots for the climate change and the health-related articles, respectively.	1

related terms appeared immediately before or after any health terms in the GD statements. This was based on a search of the 25 words before and after a reference to a climate change related term. The choice of 25-word window context corresponds to approximately half a paragraph of text. Given that UNGD statements are highly structured and methodically developed by governments over prolonged periods of time, it was assumed that half a paragraph of text around public health terms captures a sufficiently narrow context. The number of climate change term references in these contexts were then searched and counted to produce the measure of engagement with the link between health and climate change. A robustness analysis was then conducted by varying the size of the context (5, 10, and 50 words). This substantively produced the same trends over time. A sample of the references produced by the search were then also further examined to ensure that the references identified reflect engagement with the health impacts of climate change. This indicator draws on a new and updated dataset of GD statements: the United Nations General Debate corpus, in which the annual GD statements have been preprocessed and prepared for the application of natural language processing to the official English versions of the statements.156 The dataset contains all of the country speeches made in the UN General Debate between 1970 and 2018. Table 27 presents summary of the data by year. Table 27: Summary information for UN General Debate Corpus. Year	1
The search for climate change terms in the context of public health references is a proxy for the semantic linkage between the two sets of terms in GD statements. This approach produces a scalable and reproducible measure with a high degree of reliability that does not involve human judgement or subjective biases. However, there may be examples of governments referring to climate change and health but not the direct linkages between the two, which are included in the count; and there may be examples of governments discussing the health impacts of climate change in their UNGD statements, which are not included in our measure because the distance between the mention of the climate change term and the health term exceeds 25 words. Based on an analysing a sample of the speeches and references, such cases are relatively rare and do not have a significant bearing on the indicator or the trends uncovered. It is also worth noting that the analysis here is based on a narrow range of search terms, which excludes reference to many of indirect links between climate change and health. A number of GD statements in this time period refer to such indirect connections, such as the effects of climate change on water and agriculture - however, these are not included here. Therefore, the results present a somewhat conservative estimate of high level political engagement with the intersection of climate change and health. Future work in this area will consider engagement with these indirect links.	1
In the future, this indicator will look more closely at the references to indirect links between climate change and health. For example, what are the main ways in which governments view climate change impacting on health? This indicator will consider whether this changes over time, based on awareness of the multiple ways in which climate change and health are connected. Some of the references to the indirect links between climate change and health made in UNGD statements have been highlighted in the main 2019 Lancet Countdown report.	1
Some additional findings and breakdowns are presented here. Figure 56 below presents the proportion of countries that engage with the intersection of climate change and health by WHO region. It is worth noting that the relatively higher level of political engagement by countries in the Western Pacific is especially driven by the small island development states (SIDS) in this region. It also worth noting that North America WHO region contains only two countries, USA and Canada. As neither of these countries refer to the health impacts of climate change (the US statement made no reference to climate change), the North America region has zero proportion of countries engaged with the climate change-health links.	1
In addition to grouping countries by WHO region, different types of countries are also considered in terms of their potential importance and role in addressing issues related to climate change. This is provided in Figure 59. As noted in previous Lancet Countdown reports,1,131 the SIDS have driven much of the engagement with the health impacts of climate change, as well as climate change more generally, in the UN General Assembly. As such, a SIDS grouping is included. Arguably the three most important countries/unions in addressing climate change are USA, China, and the EU. This is both in terms of their carbon dioxide emissions and their power within the international system. This group is referred to as Tier 1 countries in Figure 59. Finally, an additional grouping of countries that are also important in terms of their CO2 emissions, their influence in international politics, and their potential impact on addressing climate change are considered. This grouping, which, in this indicator, is referred to as Tier 2 countries includes: Poland, Australia, South Africa, Brazil, India, France, Germany, and Indonesia. Figure 59 shows the proportion of countries that engage with the intersection of climate change and health based on these country groupings. Figure 60 shows the total number of references to the climate change-health intersection according to these groupings. Both figures demonstrate the higher level of engagement with the climate change-health linkages by SIDS than by Tier 1 or Tier 2 countries.	1
Figure 61 below shows the level of political engagement with climate change and health separately, rather than engagement with the intersection of climate change and health. This is measured by the references to the key search terms associated with climate change and health in General Debate speeches. Figure 62 shows the proportion of countries that refer to public health in their GD statements between 144	1
1970 and 2017, while Figure 63 shows the proportion of countries that make a reference to climate change during this period. The figures show that in general there is higher levels of engagement with climate change than health. Figures 64 and 66 also show a sharp increase in engagement with climate change in the General Debate around 2006, followed by a decline in 2009 after the COP15 in Copenhagen that year. However, there has been an increase in engagement with climate change in recent years around the Paris Agreement. Engagement with health has in comparison been lower. However, there has broadly been increasing engagement with public health during this time period, and a sharp increase in 2000 with the launch of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). There is also an increase in the salience of global health from 2012 onwards, which coincides with the transition from the MDGs to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).	1
Figure 64 below presents a world map, which shows the countries that refer to the intersection of climate change and health in their 2018 GD statements, and the number of individual references they make. The map shows the relatively low level of engagement with the health impacts of climate change around the world in 2018. However, due to their size the SIDS do not show up on the map. As noted, the SIDS tend to be highly represented among nations engaging with the health-climate change links. Figure 65 and Figure 66 present world maps, which show the countries that refer to public health and climate change respectively in their 2018 GD statements, as well as indicating the number of references made by each country. The figures demonstrate that while there is relatively low engagement with the intersection of 146	1

In order to produce an indicator of engagement with the intersection of climate change and health, this indicator focused on whether any of the climate change related terms appeared immediately before or after any public health terms in the COP reports. This was based on a search of the 25 words before and after a reference to a public health related term. Table 29 presents total number of references identified in COP reports per year, where the column "Intersection" is the count of climate change terms appearing in the context (25 words before and after) of health terms. Table 29: total number of references identified in COP reports per year. 2011 2012 2013	1
As noted above, only COP reports that were submitted in English were considered. This includes just under half of all available UN General Compact COP reports. This analysis here is based on a narrow range of search terms, which excludes reference to many of indirect links between climate change and health. Reports may also discuss indirect connections, such as the effect of climate change on agriculture, however, these are not included here. Therefore, the results present a somewhat conservative estimate of high corporate engagement with the intersection of climate change and health. Future work in this area will consider engagement with these indirect links, as well as providing additional forms of analysis. In the future, this indicator will increase the number of reports analysed by translating our key search terms into several other key languages, and incorporating reports submitted in languages other than English into this sample. Translation of key terms into Spanish, Portuguese, and German has already been implemented in WG5. These translations will be used in next year's report. Figure 75 presents the proportion of healthcare equipment and services companies referring to climate change, health, and the intersection in CP reports from 2011 to 2018, with only 12% of companies making reference to both in 2018.	1
Figure 75: Proportion of healthcare sector companies referring to climate change, health, and the intersection of health and climate change in CP reports, 2011-2018 Some additional findings and breakdowns are presented in this section. Figure 76 presents the total number of references to climate change, health, and the intersection of climate change and health across all of the COP reports (and all sectors). As noted in the main report, there are low and fairly constant levels of engagement with the climate change-health linkages.	1
Figure 77 presents the total references with the intersection of climate change and health to better show any trends occurring in engagement. The figure shows that there while total references may still be quite low, there has been an increase in engagement with the climate change-health linkages, particularly since 2015.	1
Figure 78 shows that the total proportion of COP reports that refer to climate change, health, and the intersection of climate change and health. The report shows that engagement with climate change and health are generally much higher than with the intersection. Around 60% of all COP reports refer to climate change in 2018, while approximately 45% of all reports refer to health in 2018. In contrast only 15% of reports refer to the intersection of climate change and health in 2018. The figure shows that there has been a very slight increase in the level of engagement across all three issues, however, the increase in engagement with the climate change-health intersection is far less pronounced than when total references are considered.	1
Engagement with climate change and health in the UN Global Compact COP reports by WHO region was also considered. Figure 79 shows the total number of references to the climate change-health intersection based on which of the WHO regions a company is based on, and Figure 80 shows the proportion of companies based in the different WHO regions that refer to the health impacts of climate change in their annual COP report.	1
As discussed in the main report, the highest level of engagement with the intersection of climate change and health can be seen in the alternative energy, chemicals, electricity, mobile telecommunications, oil and gas producers, and real estate investment sectors. In contrast, there were much lower levels of engagement in the healthcare sector. Additional information on engagement with the climate change-health intersection in the healthcare sector is presented here. In addition to the total number of references to, and total proportion of reports that refer to, the climate change and health, Figure 83 shows the average number of references to climate change, health, and the intersection in COP reports from healthcare corporations. The figure again demonstrates the low level of engagement with the health impacts of climate change in healthcare sector COP reports.	1
Figure 83: Average references to climate change, health, and the intersection of climate change and health in the healthcare sector COP reports, 2011-2018. Figure 84 shows the proportion of healthcare sector corporations that engage with the climate change-health intersection by WHO region. As discussed in the main report, the figure shows that healthcare sector corporations based in Europe tend to engage much more with the climate change-health links than healthcare corporations based in other regions.	1123.
