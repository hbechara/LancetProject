PREFACE

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was jointly
established by the World Meteorological Organization and the United
Nations Environment Programme in 1988, in order to: (i) assess available scientific information on climate change, (ii) assess the
environmental and socio-economic impacts of climate change, and
(iii) formulate response strategies. The IPCC First Assessment Report
was completed in August 1990 and served as the basis for negotiating
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The IPCC also
completed its 1992 Supplement and Climate Change 1994: Radiative
Forcing of Climate Change and An Evaluation of the IPCC IS92 Emission
Scenarios to assist the Convention process further.
In 1992, the Panel reorganized its Working Groups II and III to
assess, respectively, the impacts and response options, and the
social and economic aspects of climate change. It committed itself
to completing its Second Assessment in 1995, not only updating the
information on the same range of topics as in the First Assessment,
but also including the new subject area of technical issues related to
the socio-economic aspects of climate change. We applaud the IPCC
for producing its Second Assessment Report (SAR) as scheduled. We
are convinced that the SAR, as the earlier IPCC reports, would
become a standard work of reference, widely used by policymakers,
scientists and other experts.
As usual in the IPCC, success in producing this report has depended
upon the enthusiasm and cooperation of numerous busy scientists
and other experts worldwide. We are exceedingly pleased to note
here the very special efforts made by the IPCC in ensuring the
participation of scientists and other experts from the developing
and transitional economy countries in its activities, in particular in
the writing, reviewing and revising of its reports. The scientists and
experts from the developed, developing and transitional economy
countries have given of their time very generously, and governments have supported them, in the enormous intellectual and
physical effort required, often going substantially beyond reasonable demands of duty. Without such conscientious and professional
involvement, the IPCC would be greatly impoverished. We express
to all these scientists and experts, and the governments who
supported them, our sincere appreciation for their commitment.

FOREWORD

The IPCC completed its Second Assessment Report (SAR) in
December 1995. The SAR consists of four parts:
* the IPCC Second Assessment Synthesis of Scientific-Technical
Information Relevant to Interpreting Article 2 of the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change;
* the Report of Working Group I of the IPCC, the Science of Climate
Change, with a Summary for Policymakers (SPM);
* the Report of Working Group II of the IPCC, Scientific-Technical
Analyses of Impacts, Adaptations and Mitigation of Climate
Change, with SPM;
* the Report of Working Group III of the IPCC, the Economic and
Social Dimensions of Climate Change, with SPM.
The IPCC Second Assessment Synthesis and the Summaries for
Policymakers of the three Working Groups constitute the Report of
the IPCC (1995). They are published in this volume and available in
the six UN languages, namely, Arabic, Chinese, English, French,
Russian and Spanish. The Reports of the Working Groups, with their
respective SPMs, are available in English only and each is separately
published commercially.
We take this opportunity, because of much misinformation and
misunderstanding on the subject, to inform the reader on how the
IPCC conducts its assessments.
1.
The Panel at the outset decides the content, broken down
into chapters, of the report of each of its Working Groups. A writing
team of three to six experts (on some rare occasions, more) is constituted for the initial drafting and subsequent revisions of a chapter.
Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations are requested to nominate individuals with appropriate
expertise for consideration for inclusion in the writing teams. The
publication record of the nominees and other relevant information
are also requested. Lists of such individuals are compiled from
which the writing team is selected by the Bureau of the Working
Group concerned (i.e., the Co-Chairmen and the Vice-Chairmen of
the Working Group). The IPCC requires that at least one member of
each writing team be from the developing world.

in peer-reviewed journals and reports of professional organizations
such as the International Council of Scientific Unions, the World
Meteorological Organization, the United Nations Environment
Programme, the World Health Organization and the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization. Sometimes, the IPCC holds
workshops to collect information that is otherwise not readily available; this is particularly done to encourage information-gathering
on and in the developing countries.
4.
Each draft chapter is sent to tens of experts worldwide for
expert review. The reviewers are also chosen from nominations
made by governments and organizations. The mandated time for
this review is six weeks. The draft, revised in the light of the
comments received, is sent to governments and organizations for
their technical review. The mandated time for this (second) review
is also six weeks. In some cases, the expert and government reviews
are conducted simultaneously when the time factor would not
permit sequential reviews.
5.
The draft is revised a second time in the light of the reviews
received from governments and organizations. It is then sent to
governments (and organizations) one month in advance of the
session of the Working Group which would consider it. The Working
Group approves the SPM line by line and accepts the underlying
chapters; the two together constitute the Report of the Working
Group. It is not practical for the Working Group to approve its Report
which usually runs to two hundred pages or more. The meaning of
the term acceptance in this context is that the underlying chapters
and the SPM are consistent with each other.
6.
When the Working Group approves the SPM, selected
members of the writing teams -- from the developing as well as the
developed worlds -- are present and the text of the SPM is revised at
the session with their concurrence. Thus, in reality, the Reports of
the Working Groups are written and revised by experts and
reviewed by other experts.
7.
The Report of the Working Group (with the approved
SPM) is sent to governments and organizations one month before
the session of the IPCC which would consider it for acceptance.

2.
The reports are required to have a Summary for
Policymakers (SPM). The SPM should reflect the state-of-the-art
understanding of the subject matter and be written in a manner
that is readily comprehensible to the non-specialist. Differing but
scientifically or technically well-founded views should be so
exposed in the reports and the SPMs, if they cannot be reconciled in
the course of the assessment.

8.
The reader may note that the IPCC is a fully intergovernmental, scientific-technical body. All States that are Members of the
United Nations and of the World Meteorological Organization are
Members of the IPCC and its Working Groups. As such, governments approve the SPMs and accept the underlying chapters, which
are, as stated earlier, written and revised by experts.

3.
The writing teams draft the chapters and the material for
inclusion in the SPMs. The drafts are based on literature published

The IPCC Second Assessment Synthesis was drafted by a Drafting
Team constituted under the chairmanship of the Chairman of the

CLIMATE CHANGE 1995: IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT
IPCC. It underwent expert and government reviews simultaneously.
It was approved line by line by the IPCC at its Eleventh Session
(Rome, 11-15 December 1995).

Governments of the world approve/accept them for their scientifictechnical content. The final product is written by experts selected
worldwide and accepted by governments sitting in plenary sessions.

May we reiterate that the reports of the IPCC and of its Working
Groups contain the factual basis of the issue of climate change,
gleaned from available expert literature and further carefully
reviewed by experts and governments. In total more than two thousand experts worldwide participate in drafting and reviewing them.

We also take this opportunity to record the sad loss of a valued
member of the IPCC Secretariat. Mr Samuel Tewungwa, who passed
away in January 1996, was seconded by the United Nations
Environment Programme to the Secretariat. His good cheer and
good humour and dedication to duty are, and will be, much missed.

IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT SYNTHESIS OF
SCIENTIFIC-TECHNICAL INFORMATION
RELEVANT TO INTERPRETING ARTICLE 2
OF THE UN FRAMEWORK CONVENTION
ON CLIMATE CHANGE

ADDRESSING THE UNFCCC ARTICLE 2
1.1
Following a resolution of the Executive Council of the
World Meteorological Organization (July 1992), the IPCC decided
to include an examination of approaches to Article 2, the Objective
of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),
in its work programme. It organized a workshop on the subject in
October 1994 in Fortaleza, Brazil, at the invitation of the
Government of Brazil. Thereafter, the IPCC Chairman assembled a
team of lead authors (listed at the end of this report in the
Appendix) under his chairmanship to draft the Synthesis. The team
produced the draft which was submitted for expert and government
review and comment. The final draft Synthesis was approved line by
line by the IPCC at its eleventh session (Rome, 11-15 December
1995), where representatives of 116 governments were present as
well as 13 intergovernmental and 25 non-governmental organizations. It may be noted for information that all Member States of the
World Meteorological Organization and of the United Nations are
Members of the IPCC and can attend its sessions and those of its
Working Groups. The Synthesis presents information on the scientific and technical issues related to interpreting Article 2 of the
UNFCCC, drawing on the underlying IPCC Second Assessment
Report. Since the Synthesis is not simply a summary of the IPCC
Second Assessment Report, the Summaries for Policymakers of the
three IPCC Working Groups should also be consulted for a
summary of the Second Assessment Report.

Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which was open for
signature at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992.
1.4
The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, as expressed in
Article 2 is:
"... stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at
a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with
the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a timeframe sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate
change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable
economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner".

1.5
The challenges presented to the policymaker by Article 2
are the determination of what concentrations of greenhouse gases
might be regarded as "dangerous anthropogenic interference with
the climate system" and the charting of a future which allows for
economic development which is sustainable. The purpose of this
synthesis report is to provide scientific, technical and socioeconomic information that can be used, inter alia, in addressing
these challenges. It is based on the 1994 and 1995 reports of the
IPCC Working Groups.
1.6
The report follows through the various matters which are
addressed in Article 2. It first briefly summarizes the degree of
climate change -- the "interference with the climate system" --
which is projected to occur as a result of human activities. It then
goes on to highlight what we know about the vulnerabilities of
ecosystems and human communities to likely climate changes,
especially in regard to agriculture and food production and to other
factors such as water availability, health and the impact of sea-level
rise which are important considerations for sustainable development. The task of the IPCC is to provide a sound scientific basis that
would enable policymakers to better interpret dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.

1.2
During the past few decades, two important factors
regarding the relationship between humans and the Earth's climate
have become apparent. First, human activities, including the
burning of fossil fuels, land-use change and agriculture, are increasing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (which
tend to warm the atmosphere) and, in some regions, aerosols
(microscopic airborne particles, which tend to cool the atmosphere). These changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols, taken
together, are projected to change regional and global climate and
climate-related parameters such as temperature, precipitation, soil
moisture and sea level. Second, some human communities have
become more vulnerable1 to hazards such as storms, floods and
droughts as a result of increasing population density in sensitive
areas such as river basins and coastal plains. Potentially serious
changes have been identified, including an increase in some regions
in the incidence of extreme high-temperature events, floods and
droughts, with resultant consequences for fires, pest outbreaks, and
ecosystem composition, structure and functioning, including
primary productivity.

1.7
Given current trends of increasing emissions of most
greenhouse gases, atmospheric concentrations of these gases will
increase through the next century and beyond. With the growth in
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, interference with
the climate system will grow in magnitude and the likelihood of
adverse impacts from climate change that could be judged dangerous will become greater. Therefore, possible pathways of future net
emissions were considered which might lead to stabilization at
different levels and the general constraints these imply. This

1.3
Scientific and technical assessments of climate change and
its impacts have been conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC). The First Assessment, published in 1990,
provided a scientific and technical base for the UN Framework

1 Vulnerability defines the extent to which climate change may damage or

harm a system. It depends not only on a system's sensitivity but also on its
ability to adapt to new climatic conditions.

consideration forms the next part of the report and is followed by a
summary of the technical and policy options for reducing emissions
and enhancing sinks of greenhouse gases.

report presents available scientific and technical information on these
three choices. It also notes where uncertainties remain regarding such
information. Article 3 of the UNFCCC identifies a range of principles
that shall guide, inter alia, decision-making with respect to the ultimate

The report then addresses issues related to equity and to
ensuring that economic development proceeds in a sustainable
manner. This involves addressing, for instance, estimates of the
likely damage of climate change impacts, and the impacts, including costs and benefits, of adaptation and mitigation. Finally, a
number of insights from available studies point to ways of taking
initial actions (see the section on Road Forward) even if, at present,
it is difficult to decide upon a target for atmospheric concentrations,
including considerations of time-frames, that would prevent "dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system".

Climate change presents the decision maker with a set of
formidable complications: considerable remaining uncertainties
inherent in the complexity of the problem, the potential for
irreversible damages or costs, a very long planning horizon, long
time lags between emissions and effects, wide regional variations in
causes and effects, an irreducibly global problem, and a multiple of
greenhouse gases and aerosols to consider. Yet another complication is that effective protection of the climate system requires
international cooperation in the context of wide variations in
income levels, flexibility and expectations of the future; this raises
issues of efficiency and intra-national, international and intergenerational equity. Equity is an important element for legitimizing
decisions and promoting cooperation.

climate change may be carried out cooperatively by interested Parties."

The Second Assessment Report of the IPCC also provides information in this regard.
1.11
The long time-scales involved in the climate system (e.g.,
the long residence time of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere) and
in the time for replacement of infrastructure, and the lag by many
decades to centuries between stabilization of concentrations and
stabilization of temperature and mean sea level, indicate the
importance for timely decision-making.

Decisions with respect to Article 2 of the UNFCCC involve

ANTHROPOGENIC INTERFERENCE WITH
THE CLIMATE SYSTEM
Interference to the present day

pogenic greenhouse gases have also increased. An increase of greenhouse gas concentrations leads on average to an additional warming
of the atmosphere and the Earth's surface. Many greenhouse gases
remain in the atmosphere -- and affect climate -- for a long time.

2.1
In order to understand what constitutes concentrations of
greenhouse gases that would prevent dangerous interference with
the climate system, it is first necessary to understand current atmospheric concentrations and trends of greenhouse gases, and their
consequences (both present and projected) to the climate system.

2.3
Tropospheric aerosols resulting from combustion of fossil
fuels, biomass burning and other sources have led to a negative
direct forcing and possibly also to a negative indirect forcing of a
similar magnitude. While the negative forcing is focused in particular regions and subcontinental areas, it can have continental to
hemispheric scale effects on climate patterns. Locally, the aerosol
forcing can be large enough to more than offset the positive forcing

2.2
The atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases,
and among them, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous
oxide (N2O), have grown significantly since pre-industrial times (about
1750 A.D.): CO2 from about 280 to almost 360 ppmv3, CH4 from 700
to 1720 ppbv and N2O from about 275 to about 310 ppbv. These trends
can be attributed largely to human activities, mostly fossil-fuel use,
land-use change and agriculture. Concentrations of other anthro-

TO INTERPRETING ARTICLE 2 OF THE UN FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE
due to greenhouse gases. In contrast to the long-lived greenhouse
gases, anthropogenic aerosols are very short-lived in the atmosphere
and hence their radiative forcing adjusts rapidly to increases or
decreases in emissions.

sensitivity and including the effects of future changes in aerosol
concentrations leads to a projected increase of about 1C by 2100.
The corresponding projection for the highest IPCC scenario (IS92e)
combined with a "high" value of climate sensitivity gives a warming
of about 3.5C. In all cases the average rate of warming would probably be greater than any seen in the last 10,000 years, but the actual
annual to decadal changes would include considerable natural variability. Regional temperature changes could differ substantially
from the global mean value. Because of the thermal inertia of the
oceans, only 50-90% of the eventual equilibrium temperature
change would have been realized by 2100 and temperature would
continue to increase beyond 2100, even if concentrations of greenhouse gases were stabilized by that time.

2.4
Global mean surface temperature has increased by between
about 0.3 and 0.6C since the late 19th century, a change that is
unlikely to be entirely natural in origin. The balance of evidence,
from changes in global mean surface air temperature and from
changes in geographical, seasonal and vertical patterns of atmospheric temperature, suggests a discernible human influence on global
climate. There are uncertainties in key factors, including the magnitude and patterns of long-term natural variability. Global sea level
has risen by between 10 and 25 cm over the past 100 years and much
of the rise may be related to the increase in global mean temperature.

2.8
Average sea level is expected to rise as a result of thermal
expansion of the oceans and melting of glaciers and ice-sheets. For
the IS92a scenario, assuming the "best estimate" values of climate
sensitivity and of ice melt sensitivity to warming, and including
the effects of future changes in aerosol concentrations, models
project an increase in sea level of about 50 cm from the present to
2100. This estimate is approximately 25% lower than the "best
estimate" in 1990 due to the lower temperature projection, but
also reflecting improvements in the climate and ice melt models.
Combining the lowest emission scenario (IS92c) with the "low"
climate and ice melt sensitivities and including aerosol effects
gives a projected sea-level rise of about 15 cm from the present to
2100. The corresponding projection for the highest emission
scenario (IS92e) combined with "high" climate and ice-melt
sensitivities gives a sea-level rise of about 95 cm from the present
to 2100. Sea level would continue to rise at a similar rate in future
centuries beyond 2100, even if concentrations of greenhouse gases
were stabilized by that time, and would continue to do so even
beyond the time of stabilization of global mean temperature.
Regional sea-level changes may differ from the global mean value
owing to land movement and ocean current changes.

2.5
There are inadequate data to determine whether consistent global changes in climate variability or weather extremes have
occurred over the 20th century. On regional scales there is clear
evidence of changes in some extremes and climate variability indicators. Some of these changes have been toward greater variability,
some have been toward lower variability. However, to date it has
not been possible to firmly establish a clear connection between
these regional changes and human activities.

Possible consequences of future interference
2.6
In the absence of mitigation policies or significant technological advances that reduce emissions and/or enhance sinks,
concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols are expected to grow
throughout the next century. The IPCC has developed a range of
scenarios, IS92a-f, of future greenhouse gas and aerosol precursor emissions based on assumptions concerning population and economic
growth, land-use, technological changes, energy availability and fuel
mix during the period 1990 to 21004. By the year 2100, carbon dioxide emissions under these scenarios are projected to be in the range of
about 6 GtC5 per year, roughly equal to current emissions, to as much
as 36 GtC per year, with the lower end of the IPCC range assuming low
population and economic growth to 2100. Methane emissions are
projected to be in the range 540 to 1170 Tg6 CH4 per year (1990 emissions were about 500 Tg CH4); nitrous oxide emissions are projected
to be in the range 14 to 19 Tg N per year (1990 emissions were about
13 Tg N). In all cases, the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases and total radiative forcing continue to increase throughout the
simulation period of 1990 to 2100.

2.9
Confidence is higher in the hemispheric-to-continental scale
projections of coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models than in the
regional projections, where confidence remains low. There is more
confidence in temperature projections than hydrological changes.
2.10
All model simulations, whether they were forced with
increased concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols or with
increased concentrations of greenhouse gases alone, show the following features: greater surface warming of the land than of the sea in
winter; a maximum surface warming in high northern

2.7
For the mid-range IPCC emission scenario, IS92a, assuming the "best estimate" value of climate sensitivity7 and including
the effects of future increases in aerosol concentrations, models
project an increase in global mean surface temperature relative to
1990 of about 2C by 2100. This estimate is approximately onethird lower than the "best estimate" in 1990. This is due primarily
to lower emission scenarios (particularly for CO2 and CFCs), the
inclusion of the cooling effect of sulphate aerosols, and improvements in the treatment of the carbon cycle. Combining the lowest
IPCC emission scenario (IS92c) with a "low" value of climate

7 In IPCC reports, climate sensitivity usually refers to long-term (equilibrium) change in global mean surface temperature following a doubling of
atmospheric equivalent CO2 concentration. More generally, it refers to the
equilibrium change in surface air temperature following a unit change in
radiative forcing (C/Wm-2).

CLIMATE CHANGE 1995: IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT
latitudes in winter, little surface warming over the Arctic in summer;
an enhanced global mean hydrological cycle, and increased precipitation and soil moisture in high latitudes in winter. All these changes
are associated with identifiable physical mechanisms.

2.12
There are many uncertainties and many factors currently
limit our ability to project and detect future climate change.
Future unexpected, large and rapid climate system changes
(as have occurred in the past) are, by their nature, difficult to
predict. This implies that future climate changes may also involve
"surprises". In particular, these arise from the non-linear nature
of the climate system. When rapidly forced, non-linear systems
are especially subject to unexpected behaviour. Progress can
be made by investigating non-linear processes and subcomponents of the climatic system. Examples of such non-linear
behaviour include rapid circulation changes in the North
Atlantic and feedbacks associated with terrestrial ecosystem
changes.

2.11
Warmer temperatures will lead to a more vigorous
hydrological cycle; this translates into prospects for more severe
droughts and/or floods in some places and less severe droughts
and/or floods in other places. Several models indicate an increase in
precipitation intensity, suggesting a possibility for more extreme
rainfall events. Knowledge is currently insufficient to say whether
there will be any changes in the occurrence or geographical
distribution of severe storms, e.g., tropical cyclones.

SENSITIVITY AND ADAPTATION OF
SYSTEMS TO CLIMATE CHANGE
3.1
This section provides scientific and technical information
that can be used, inter alia, in evaluating whether the projected
range of plausible impacts constitutes "dangerous anthropogenic
interference with the climate system", as referred to in Article 2, and
in evaluating adaptation options. However, it is not yet possible to
link particular impacts with specific atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases.

3
subject to multiple climatic and non-climatic stresses, the interactions of which are not always linear or additive; and very few studies
have considered dynamic responses to steadily increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases or the consequences of increases
beyond a doubling of equivalent atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
3.5
Unambiguous detection of climate-induced changes in
most ecological and social systems will prove extremely difficult in
the coming decades. This is because of the complexity of these
systems, their many non-linear feedbacks, and their sensitivity to a
large number of climatic and non-climatic factors, all of which are
expected to continue to change simultaneously. As future climate
extends beyond the boundaries of empirical knowledge (i.e., the
documented impacts of climate variation in the past), it becomes
more likely that actual outcomes will include surprises and
unanticipated rapid changes.

3.2
Human health, terrestrial and aquatic ecological systems,
and socio-economic systems (e.g., agriculture, forestry, fisheries and
water resources) are all vital to human development and well-being
and are all sensitive to both the magnitude and the rate of climate
change. Whereas many regions are likely to experience the adverse
effects of climate change -- some of which are potentially
irreversible -- some effects of climate change are likely to be
beneficial. Hence, different segments of society can expect to
confront a variety of changes and the need to adapt to them.

Sensitivity of systems
3.3
Human-induced climate change represents an important
additional stress, particularly to the many ecological and socioeconomic systems already affected by pollution, increasing resource
demands, and non-sustainable management practices. The
vulnerability of human health and socio-economic systems -- and,
to a lesser extent, ecological systems -- depends upon economic
circumstances and institutional infrastructure. This implies that
systems typically are more vulnerable in developing countries where
economic and institutional circumstances are less favourable.

Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
3.6
Ecosystems contain the Earth's entire reservoir of genetic
and species diversity and provide many goods and services including:
(i) providing food, fibre, medicines and energy; (ii) processing and
storing carbon and other nutrients; (iii) assimilating wastes, purifying
water, regulating water runoff, and controlling floods, soil degradation and beach erosion; and (iv) providing opportunities for
recreation and tourism. The composition and geographic distribution of many ecosystems (e.g., forests, rangelands, deserts, mountain
systems, lakes, wetlands and oceans) will shift as individual species
respond to changes in climate; there will likely be reductions in
biological diversity and in the goods and services that ecosystems
provide society. Some ecological systems may not reach a new equilibrium for several centuries after the climate achieves a new balance.

3.4
Although our knowledge has increased significantly
during the last decade and qualitative estimates can be developed,
quantitative projections of the impacts of climate change on any
particular system at any particular location are difficult because
regional-scale climate change projections are uncertain; our current
understanding of many critical processes is limited; systems are
6

IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT SYNTHESIS OF SCIENTIFIC-TECHNICAL INFORMATION RELEVANT
TO INTERPRETING ARTICLE 2 OF THE UN FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE
This section illustrates the impact of climate change on a number of
selected ecological systems.

Anticipated hydrological changes and reductions in the areal extent
and depth of permafrost could lead to large-scale damage to infrastructure, an additional flux of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,
and changes in processes that contribute to the flux of methane
into the atmosphere.

3.7
Forests: Models project that as a consequence of possible
changes in temperature and water availability under doubled equivalent8 CO2 equilibrium conditions, a substantial fraction (a global
average of one-third, varying by region from one-seventh to twothirds) of the existing forested area of the world will undergo major
changes in broad vegetation types -- with the greatest changes
occurring in high latitudes and the least in the tropics. Climate
change is expected to occur at a rapid rate relative to the speed at
which forest species grow, reproduce and re-establish themselves.
Therefore, the species composition of forests is likely to change;
entire forest types may disappear, while new assemblages of species
and hence new ecosystems may be established. Large amounts of
carbon could be released into the atmosphere during transitions
from one forest type to another because the rate at which carbon
can be lost during times of high forest mortality is greater than the
rate at which it can be gained through growth to maturity.

3.12
Climate change will lead to an intensification of the
global hydrological cycle and can have major impacts on regional
water resources. Changes in the total amount of precipitation and
in its frequency and intensity directly affect the magnitude and
timing of runoff and the intensity of floods and droughts; however,
at present, specific regional effects are uncertain. Relatively small
changes in temperature and precipitation, together with the nonlinear effects on evapotranspiration and soil moisture, can result in
relatively large changes in runoff, especially in arid and semi-arid
regions. The quantity and quality of water supplies already are
serious problems today in many regions, including some low-lying
coastal areas, deltas and small islands, making countries in these
regions particularly vulnerable to any additional reduction in
indigenous water supplies.

3.8
Deserts and desertification: Deserts are likely to become
more extreme -- in that, with few exceptions, they are projected to
become hotter but not significantly wetter. Temperature increases
could be a threat to organisms that exist near their heat tolerance
limits. Desertification -- land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry
sub-humid areas resulting from various factors, including climatic
variations and human activities -- is more likely to become irreversible if the environment becomes drier and the soil becomes
further degraded through erosion and compaction.

Agriculture and forestry
3.13
Crop yields and changes in productivity due to climate
change will vary considerably across regions and among localities,
thus changing the patterns of production. Productivity is projected to
increase in some areas and decrease in others, especially the tropics
and subtropics. Existing studies show that on the whole, global agricultural production could be maintained relative to baseline
production in the face of climate change projected under doubled
equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions. This conclusion takes into
account the beneficial effects of CO2 fertilization but does not allow
for changes in agricultural pests and the possible effects of changing
climatic variability. However, focusing on global agricultural production does not address the potentially serious consequences of large
differences at local and regional scales, even at mid-latitudes. There
may be increased risk of hunger and famine in some locations; many
of the world's poorest people -- particularly those living in subtropical and tropical areas and dependent on isolated agricultural systems
in semi-arid and arid regions -- are most at risk of increased hunger.
Global wood supplies during the next century may become increasingly inadequate to meet projected consumption due to both
climatic and non-climatic factors.

3.9
Mountain ecosystems: The altitudinal distribution of
vegetation is projected to shift to higher elevation; some species with
climatic ranges limited to mountain tops could become extinct
because of disappearance of habitat or reduced migration potential.
3.10
Aquatic and coastal ecosystems: In lakes and streams,
warming would have the greatest biological effects at high latitudes,
where biological productivity would increase, and at the lowlatitude boundaries of cold- and cool-water species ranges, where
extinctions would be greatest. The geographical distribution of
wetlands is likely to shift with changes in temperature and precipitation. Coastal systems are economically and ecologically important
and are expected to vary widely in their response to changes in
climate and sea level. Some coastal ecosystems are particularly at
risk, including saltwater marshes, mangrove ecosystems, coastal
wetlands, sandy beaches, coral reefs, coral atolls and river deltas.
Changes in these ecosystems would have major negative effects on
tourism, freshwater supplies, fisheries and biodiversity.

Human infrastructure
3.14
Climate change clearly will increase the vulnerability of
some coastal populations to flooding and erosional land loss.
Estimates put about 46 million people per year currently at risk of
flooding due to storm surges. In the absence of adaptation
measures, and not taking into account anticipated population
growth, 50-cm sea-level rise would increase this number to about 92
million; a 1-meter sea-level rise would raise it to about 118 million.

Hydrology and water resources management
3.11
Models project that between one-third and one-half of
existing mountain glacier mass could disappear over the next
hundred years. The reduced extent of glaciers and depth of snow
cover also would affect the seasonal distribution of river flow and
water supply for hydroelectric generation and agriculture.

CLIMATE CHANGE 1995: IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT
Studies using a 1-meter projection show a particular risk for small
islands and deltas. This increase is at the top range of IPCC Working
Group I estimates for 2100; it should be noted, however, that sea
level is actually projected to continue to rise in future centuries
beyond 2100. Estimated land losses range from 0.05% in Uruguay,
1.0% for Egypt, 6% for the Netherlands and 17.5% for Bangladesh
to about 80% for the Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands, given the
present state of protection systems. Some small island nations and
other countries will confront greater vulnerability because their
existing sea and coastal defense systems are less well established.
Countries with higher population densities would be more vulnerable. Storm surges and flooding could threaten entire cultures. For
these countries, sea-level rise could force internal or international
migration of populations.

coexistent and interacting factors that characterize the vulnerability
of the particular population, including environmental and socioeconomic circumstances, nutritional and immune status,
population density and access to quality health care services. Hence,
populations with different levels of natural, technical and social
resources would differ in their vulnerability to climate-induced
health impacts.

Technology and policy options for adaptation
3.17
Technological advances generally have increased adaptation options for managed systems. Adaptation options for freshwater
resources include more efficient management of existing supplies
and infrastructure; institutional arrangements to limit future
demands/promote conservation; improved monitoring and forecasting systems for floods/droughts; rehabilitation of watersheds,
especially in the tropics; and construction of new reservoir capacity.
Adaptation options for agriculture -- such as changes in types and
varieties of crops, improved water-management and irrigation
systems, and changes in planting schedules and tillage practices --
will be important in limiting negative effects and taking advantage of
beneficial changes in climate. Effective coastal-zone management
and land-use planning can help direct population shifts away from
vulnerable locations such as flood plains, steep hillsides and lowlying coastlines. Adaptive options to reduce health impacts include
protective technology (e.g., housing, air conditioning, water purification and vaccination), disaster preparedness and appropriate
health care.

Human health
3.15
Climate change is likely to have wide-ranging and mostly
adverse impacts on human health, with significant loss of life. Direct
health effects include increases in (predominantly cardio-respiratory)
mortality and illness due to an anticipated increase in the intensity and
duration of heat waves. Temperature increases in colder regions should
result in fewer cold-related deaths. Indirect effects of climate change,
which are expected to predominate, include increases in the potential
transmission of vector-borne infectious diseases (e.g., malaria, dengue,
yellow fever and some viral encephalitis) resulting from extensions of
the geographical range and season for vector organisms. Models (that
entail necessary simplifying assumptions) project that temperature
increases of 3-5C (compared to the IPCC projection of 1-3.5C by
2100) could lead to potential increases in malaria incidence (of the
order of 50-80 million additional annual cases, relative to an assumed
global background total of 500 million cases), primarily in tropical,
subtropical and less well-protected temperate-zone populations.
Some increases in non-vector-borne infectious diseases -- such as
salmonellosis, cholera and giardiasis -- also could occur as a result of
elevated temperatures and increased flooding. Limitations on freshwater supplies and on nutritious food, as well as the aggravation of air
pollution, will also have human health consequences.

3.18
However, many regions of the world currently have
limited access to these technologies and appropriate information.
For some island nations, the high cost of providing adequate
protection would make it essentially infeasible, especially given
the limited availability of capital for investment. The efficacy and
cost-effective use of adaptation strategies will depend upon the
availability of financial resources, technology transfer, and
cultural, educational, managerial, institutional, legal and
regulatory practices, both domestic and international in scope.
Incorporating climate-change concerns into resource-use and
development decisions and plans for regularly scheduled
investments in infrastructure will facilitate adaptation.

3.16
Quantifying the projected impacts is difficult because the
extent of climate-induced health disorders depends on numerous

ANALYTICAL APPROACH TO STABILIZATION OF
ATMOSPHERIC CONCENTRATIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES
4.1
Article 2 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change refers explicitly to "stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations". This section provides information on the relative
importance of various greenhouse gases to climate forcing and
discusses how greenhouse gas emissions might be varied to achieve
stabilization at selected atmospheric concentration levels.

4

4.2
Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have natural as
well as anthropogenic origins. The anthropogenic emissions of these
gases have contributed about 80% of the additional climate forcing
due to greenhouse gases since pre-industrial times (i.e., since about
1750 A.D.). The contribution of CO2 is about 60% of this forcing,
about four times that from CH4.

8

IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT SYNTHESIS OF SCIENTIFIC-TECHNICAL INFORMATION RELEVANT
TO INTERPRETING ARTICLE 2 OF THE UN FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE
4.3
Other greenhouse gases include tropospheric ozone (whose
chemical precursors include nitrogen oxides, non-methane hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide), halocarbons9 (including HCFCs and
HFCs) and SF6. Tropospheric aerosols and tropospheric ozone are
inhomogeneously distributed in time and space and their atmospheric lifetimes are short (days to weeks). Sulphate aerosols are
amenable to abatement measures and such measures are presumed in
the IPCC scenarios.

stabilized concentration value, higher emissions in early decades
require lower emissions later on. Cumulative emissions from 1991
to 2100 corresponding to these stabilization levels are shown in
Table 1, together with the cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide
for all of the IPCC IS92 emission scenarios (see Figure 2 below and
Table 1 in the Summary for Policymakers of IPCC Working Group
II for details of these scenarios).
4.9
Figure 1 and Table 1 are presented to clarify some of the
constraints that would be imposed on future carbon dioxide emissions, if stabilization at the concentration levels illustrated were to
be achieved. These examples do not represent any form of recommendation about how such stabilization levels might be achieved or
the level of stabilization which might be chosen.

4.4
Most emission scenarios indicate that, in the absence of
mitigation policies, greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise
during the next century and lead to greenhouse gas concentrations
that by the year 2100 are projected to change climate more than
that projected for twice the pre-industrial concentrations of carbon
dioxide.

4.10
Given cumulative emissions, and IPCC IS92a population
and economic scenarios for 1990-2100, global annual average
carbon dioxide emissions can be derived for the stabilization scenarios on a per capita or per unit of economic activity basis. If the
atmospheric concentration is to remain below 550 ppmv, the future
global annual average emissions cannot, during the next century,
exceed the current global average and would have to be much lower
before and beyond the end of the next century. Global annual
average emissions could be higher for stabilization levels of 750 to
1000 ppmv. Nevertheless, even to achieve these latter stabilization
levels, the global annual average emissions would need to be less
than 50% above current levels on a per capita basis or less than half
of current levels per unit of economic activity11.

Stabilization of greenhouse gases
4.5
All relevant greenhouse gases need to be considered in
addressing stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations. First,
carbon dioxide is considered which, because of its importance and
complicated behaviour, needs more detailed consideration than the
other greenhouse gases.

Carbon dioxide
4.6
Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by a
number of processes that operate on different time-scales. It has a
relatively long residence time in the climate system -- of the order
of a century or more. If net global anthropogenic emissions10 (i.e.,
anthropogenic sources minus anthropogenic sinks) were
maintained at current levels (about 7 GtC/yr including emissions
from fossil-fuel combustion, cement production and land-use
change), they would lead to a nearly constant rate of increase in
atmospheric concentrations for at least two centuries, reaching
about 500 ppmv (approaching twice the pre-industrial
concentration of 280 ppmv) by the end of the 21st century.
Carbon cycle models show that immediate stabilization of the
concentration of carbon dioxide at its present level could only be
achieved through an immediate reduction in its emissions of 5070% and further reductions thereafter.

4.1112 The global average annual per capita emissions of carbon
dioxide due to the combustion of fossil fuels is at present about 1.1
tonnes (as carbon). In addition, a net of about 0.2 tonnes per capita
are emitted from deforestation and land-use change. The average
annual fossil fuel per capita emission in developed and transitional
economy countries is about 2.8 tonnes and ranges from 1.5 to 5.5
tonnes. The figure for the developing countries is 0.5 tonnes
ranging from 0.1 tonnes to, in some few cases, above 2.0 tonnes (all
figures are for 1990).

4.7
Carbon cycle models have been used to estimate profiles
of carbon dioxide emissions for stabilization at various carbon
dioxide concentration levels. Such profiles have been generated for
an illustrative set of levels: 450, 550, 650, 750 and 1000 ppmv.
Among the many possible pathways to reach stabilization, two are
illustrated in Figure 1 for each of the stabilization levels of 450, 550,
650 and 750 ppmv, and one for 1000 ppmv. The steeper the
increase in the emissions (hence concentration) in these scenarios,
the more quickly is the climate projected to change.

9

4.1213 Using World Bank estimates of GDP (gross domestic
product) at market exchange rates, the current global annual
average emission of energy-related carbon dioxide is about 0.3
tonnes per thousand 1990 US dollars output. In addition, global net
emissions from land-use changes are about 0.05 tonnes per
thousand US dollars of output. The current average annual energyMost halocarbons, but neither HFCs nor PFCs, are controlled by the
Montreal Protocol and its Adjustments and Amendments.

10 For the remainder of Section 4, "net global anthropogenic emissions" (i.e.,

anthropogenic sources minus anthropogenic sinks) will be abbreviated to
"emissions".
11 China registered its disagreement on the use of carbon dioxide emissions

derived on the basis of a per unit economic activity.

4.8
Any eventual stabilized concentration is governed more
by the accumulated anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions from
now until the time of stabilization, than by the way those
emissions change over the period. This means that, for a given

about 1C (range: 0.5 to 1.5C), 2C (range: 1.5 to 4C) and 3.5C
(range: 2 to 7C), respectively. A doubling of the pre-industrial
carbon dioxide concentration of 280 ppmv would lead to a concentration of 560 ppmv and doubling of the current concentration of
358 ppmv would lead to a concentration of about 720 ppmv.

Table 1. Total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions accumulated from 1991 to 2100 inclusive (GtC)
for the IS92 scenarios (see Table 1 in the Summary for
Policymakers of IPCC Working Group II) and for stabilization at various levels of carbon dioxide
concentration following the two sets of pathways
shown in Figure 1 (a). The accumulated emissions
leading to stabilization of carbon dioxide concentration were calculated using a mid-range carbon cycle
model. Results from other models could be up to
approximately 15% higher or lower than those
presented here.

For comparison, emissions during the period 1860 to 1994 amounted to about
360 GtC, of which about 240 GtC were due to fossil-fuel use and 120 GtC due
to deforestation and land-use change.
As in IPCC (1994) -- see Figure 1 (a) (solid curves).
Profiles that allow emissions to follow IS92a until at least the year 2000 --
see figure 1 (a) (dashed curves).
Concentrations will not stabilize by 2100.

Further points on stabilization

related emissions per thousand 1990 US dollars output, evaluated at
market exchange rates, is about 0.27 tonnes in developed and
transitional economy countries and about 0.41 tonnes in
developing countries. Using World Bank estimates of GDP at
purchasing power parity exchange rates, the average annual energyrelated emissions per thousand 1990 US dollars output is about 0.26
tonnes in developed and transitional economy countries and about
0.16 tonnes in developing countries.15

4.15
Stabilization of the concentrations of very long-lived
gases, such as SF6 or perfluorocarbons, can only be achieved effectively by stopping emissions.
4.16
The importance of the contribution of CO2 to climate
forcing, relative to that of the other greenhouse gases, increases
with time in all of the IS92 emission scenarios (a to f). For example,
in the IS92a scenario, the CO2 contribution increases from the
present 60% to about 75% by the year 2100. During the same
period, methane and nitrous oxide forcings increase in absolute
terms by a factor that ranges between two and three.

Methane
4.13
Atmospheric methane concentrations adjust to changes in
anthropogenic emissions over a period of 9 to 15 years. If the
annual methane emissions were immediately reduced by about 30
Tg CH4 (about 8% of current anthropogenic emissions), methane
concentrations would remain at today's levels. If methane emissions were to remain constant at their current levels, methane
concentrations (1720 ppbv in 1994) would rise to about 1820 ppbv
over the next 40 years.

4.17
The combined effect of all greenhouse gases in producing
radiative forcing is often expressed in terms of the equivalent
concentration of carbon dioxide which would produce the same
forcing. Because of the effects of the other greenhouse gases, stabilization at some level of equivalent carbon dioxide concentration
implies maintaining carbon dioxide concentration at a lower level.

Nitrous oxide
4.18
The stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations does
not imply that there will be no further climate change. After
stabilization is achieved, global mean surface temperature would
continue to rise for some centuries and sea level for many centuries.

4.14
Nitrous oxide has a long lifetime (about 120 years). In
order for the concentration to be stabilized near current levels (312
ppbv in 1994), anthropogenic sources would need to be reduced
immediately by more than 50%. If emissions of nitrous oxide were
held constant at current levels, its concentration would rise to about
400 ppbv over several hundred years, which would increase its
incremental radiative forcing by a factor of four over its current
level.

15 These calculations of emissions per unit of economic activity do not
include emissions from land-use changes or adjustments to reflect the informal economy.

CLIMATE CHANGE 1995: IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT

TECHNOLOGY AND POLICY OPTIONS FOR MITIGATION

5.1
The IPCC Second Assessment Report (1995) examines a wide
range of approaches to reduce emissions and enhance sinks of greenhouse gases. This section provides technical information on options
that could be used to reduce anthropogenic emissions and enhance
sinks of the principal greenhouse gases with a view to stabilizing their
atmospheric concentrations; however, this analysis does not attempt
to quantify potential macroeconomic consequences that may be associated with mitigation.

5

current technology with more-efficient technology could still lead to
an absolute increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the future.
Technologies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in
energy end-use sectors include:

* Industry: improving efficiency; recycling materials and switching to
those with lower greenhouse gas emissions; and developing
processes that use less energy and materials.
* Transportation: the use of very efficient vehicle drive-trains, lightweight construction and low-air-resistance design; the use of smaller
vehicles; altered land-use patterns, transport systems, mobility
patterns and lifestyles; and shifting to less energy-intensive transport modes; and the use of alternative fuels and electricity from
renewable and other fuel sources which do not enhance atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.
* Commercial/residential: reduced heat transfers through building
structures and more-efficient space-conditioning and water supply
systems, lighting and appliances.

5.2
Significant reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions are
technically possible and can be economically feasible. These reductions can be achieved by utilizing an extensive array of technologies
and policy measures that accelerate technology development, diffusion and transfer in all sectors, including the energy, industry,
transportation, residential/commercial and agricultural/forestry
sectors.
5.3
The degree to which technical potential and cost-effectiveness are realized is dependent on initiatives to counter lack of
information and overcome cultural, institutional, legal, financial
and economic barriers which can hinder diffusion of technology or
behavioural changes.

Energy supply
5.6
It is technically possible to realize deep emissions reductions
in the energy supply sector within 50 to 100 years using alternative
strategies, in step with the normal timing of investments to replace
infrastructure and equipment as it wears out or becomes obsolete.
Promising approaches, not ordered according to priority, include:

5.4
By the year 2100, the world's commercial energy system in
effect will be replaced at least twice, offering opportunities to
change the energy system without premature retirement of capital
stock; significant amounts of capital stock in the industrial,
commercial, residential and agricultural/forestry sectors will also be
replaced. These cycles of capital replacement provide opportunities
to utilize new, better performing technologies.

* More-efficient conversion of fossil fuels (e.g., combined heat

Energy demand
5.5
The IPCC projects (IPCC 1992; IPCC 1994) that without
policy intervention, there could be significant growth in emissions
from the industrial, transportation and commercial/residential buildings sectors. Numerous studies have indicated that 10-30% energy
efficiency gains above present levels are feasible at negative16 to zero
cost in each of the sectors in many parts of the world through technical conservation measures and improved management practices
over the next two to three decades. Using technologies that presently
yield the highest output of energy services for a given input of
energy, efficiency gains of 50-60% would be technically feasible in
many countries over the same time period. Achieving these potentials will depend on future cost reductions, the rate of development
and implementation of new technologies, financing and technology
transfer, as well as measures to overcome a variety of non-technical
barriers. Because energy use is growing worldwide, even replacing

* Decarbonization of flue gases and fuels and carbon dioxide
storage (e.g., removal and storage of CO2 from the use of fossil
fuel feedstocks to make hydrogen-rich fuels);
* Reducing fugitive emissions, especially of methane, in fuel
extraction and distribution.
Switching to non-fossil fuel sources of energy
* Switching to nuclear energy (if generally acceptable
responses can be found to concerns such as about reactor
safety, radioactive-waste transport and disposal, and nuclear

biomass, wind, hydro and geothermal).

IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT SYNTHESIS OF SCIENTIFIC-TECHNICAL INFORMATION RELEVANT
TO INTERPRETING ARTICLE 2 OF THE UN FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE

Integration of energy system mitigation options

such as production of iron, steel, aluminum, ammonia, cement
and other materials. Measures include modifying production
processes, eliminating solvents, replacing feedstocks, materials
substitution, increased recycling and reduced consumption of
greenhouse gas-intensive materials. Capturing and utilizing
methane from landfills and sewage treatment facilities, and
lowering the leakage rate of halocarbon refrigerants from mobile
and stationary sources, also can lead to significant greenhouse gas
emission reductions.

5.7
The potential for greenhouse gas emission reductions
exceeds the potential for energy use efficiency because of the
possibility of switching fuels and energy sources, and reducing the
demand for energy services. Even greater energy efficiency, and
hence reduced greenhouse gas emissions, could be attained with
comprehensive energy source-to-service chains.
5.8
To assess the potential impact of combinations of individual measures at the energy systems level, "thought experiments"
exploring variants of a low-CO2 emitting energy supply system were
described. These variants illustrate the technical possibility of deep
reductions in CO2 emissions from the energy supply system within
50 to 100 years using alternative strategies. These exercises indicate
the technical possibility of reducing annual global emissions from 6
GtC in 1990 to about 4 GtC in 2050 and to about 2 GtC by 2100.
Cumulative CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2100 would range from
about 450 GtC to about 470 GtC in these constructions, thus
keeping atmospheric concentrations below 500 ppmv.

Agriculture, rangelands and forestry
5.12
Beyond the use of biomass fuels to displace fossil fuels,
the management of forests, agricultural lands and rangelands can
play an important role in reducing current emissions of carbon
dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, and enhancing carbon sinks.
A number of measures could conserve and sequester substantial
amounts of carbon (approximately 60-90 GtC in the forestry sector
alone) over the next 50 years. In the forestry sector, measures
include sustaining existing forest cover; slowing deforestation;
natural forest regeneration; establishment of tree plantations;
promoting agroforestry. Other practices in the agriculture sector
could reduce emissions of other greenhouse gases such as methane
and nitrous oxide. In the forestry sector, costs for conserving and
sequestering carbon in biomass and soil are estimated to range
widely but can be competitive with other mitigation options.

5.9
Costs for integrated energy services relative to costs for
conventional energy depend on relative future energy prices, which
are uncertain within a wide range, and on the performance and
cost characteristics assumed for alternative technologies. However,
within the wide range of future energy prices, one or more of the
variants would plausibly be capable of providing the demanded
energy services at estimated costs that are approximately the same
as estimated future costs for current conventional energy. It is not
possible to identify a least-cost future energy system for the longer
term, as the relative costs of options depend on resource constraints
and technological opportunities that are imperfectly known, and
on actions by governments and the private sector. Improving
energy efficiency, a strong and sustained investment in research,
and development and demonstration to encourage transfer and
diffusion of alternative energy supply technologies are critical to
deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Many of the
technologies being developed would need initial support to enter
the market and to reach sufficient volume to lower costs to become
competitive.

Policy instruments
5.13
The availability of low carbon technologies is a
prerequisite for, but not a guarantee of, the ability to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions at reasonable cost. Mitigation of
emissions depends on reducing barriers to the diffusion and
transfer of technology, mobilizing financial resources, supporting
capacity building in developing countries and countries with
economies in transition, and other approaches to assist in the
implementation of behavioural changes and technological
opportunities in all regions of the globe. The optimum mix of
policies will vary from country to country, depending upon energy
markets, economic considerations, political structure and societal
receptiveness. The leadership of national governments in applying
these policies will contribute to responding to the adverse
consequences of climate change. Policies to reduce net greenhouse
gas emissions appear more easily implemented when they are
designed to also address other concerns that impede sustainable
development (e.g., air pollution, soil erosion). A number of
policies, many of which might be used by individual nations
unilaterally, and some of which may be used by groups of
countries and would require regional or international agreement,
can facilitate the penetration of less greenhouse gas-intensive
technologies and modified consumption patterns. These include,
inter alia (not ordered according to priority):

5.10
Market penetration and continued acceptability of
different energy technologies ultimately depend on their relative
cost, performance (including environmental performance),
institutional arrangements, and regulations and policies. Because
costs vary by location and application, the wide variety of
circumstances creates initial opportunities for new technologies to
enter the market. Deeper understanding of the opportunities for
emissions reductions would require more detailed analysis of
options, taking into account local conditions.

Industrial process and human settlement emissions
5.11
Large reductions are possible in some cases in processrelated greenhouse gases including CO2, CH4, N2O, halocarbons
and SF6, released during manufacturing and industrial processes,

5.14
The choice of measures at the domestic level may reflect
objectives other than cost-effectiveness such as meeting fiscal
targets. If a carbon or carbon-energy tax is used as a policy
instrument for reducing emissions, the taxes could raise
substantial revenues and how the revenues are distributed could
dramatically affect the cost of mitigation. If the revenues
are distributed by reducing distortionary taxes in the existing
system, they will help reduce the excess burden of the existing
tax system, potentially yielding an additional economic benefit
(double dividend). For example, those of the European studies
which are more optimistic regarding the potential for tax
recycling, show lower and, in some instances, slightly negative
costs. Conversely, inefficient recycling of the tax revenues
could increase costs. For example, if the tax revenues are used to
finance government programmes that yield a lower return than
the private sector investments foregone because of the tax, then
overall costs will increase. The choice of instruments may also
reflect other environmental objectives such as reducing nongreenhouse pollution emissions or increasing forest cover or other
concerns such as specific impacts on particular regions or
communities.

EQUITY AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
6.1
Equity considerations are an important aspect of climate
change policy and of the Convention and in achieving sustainable
development17. Equity involves procedural as well as consequential
issues. Procedural issues relate to how decisions are made while
consequential issues relate to outcomes. To be effective and to
promote cooperation, agreements must be regarded as legitimate,
and equity is an important element in gaining legitimacy.

6

6.4
Climate change is likely to impose costs on future generations and on regions where damages occur, including regions with
low greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change impacts will be
distributed unevenly.
6.5
The intertemporal aspects of climate change policy also
raise questions of intergenerational equity because future generations are not able to influence directly the policies being chosen
today that could affect their well-being, and because it might not be
possible to compensate future generations for consequent reductions in their well-being. Discounting is the principal analytical tool
economists use to compare economic effects that occur at different
points in time. The choice of discount rate is of crucial technical
importance for analyses of climate change policy, because the time
horizon is extremely long and mitigation costs tend to come much
earlier than the benefits of avoided damages. The higher the
discount rate, the less future benefits and the more current costs
matter in the analysis.

6.2
Procedural equity encompasses process and participation
issues. It requires that all Parties be able to participate effectively in
international negotiations related to climate change. Appropriate
measures to enable developing country Parties to participate effectively in negotiations increase the prospects for achieving effective,
lasting and equitable agreements on how best to address the threat
of climate change. Concern about equity and social impacts points
the need to build endogenous capabilities and strengthen institutional capacities, particularly in developing countries, to make and
implement collective decisions in a legitimate and equitable manner.
6.3
Consequential equity has two components: the distribution of the costs of damages or adaptation and of measures to
mitigate climate change. Because countries differ substantially in
vulnerability, wealth, capacity, resource endowments and other
factors listed below, unless addressed explicitly, the costs of the
damages, adaptation and mitigation may be borne inequitably.

6.6
The Convention recognizes in Article 3.1 the principle
of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective

17 In common language equity means "the quality of being impartial" or

"something that is fair and just".

14

IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT SYNTHESIS OF SCIENTIFIC-TECHNICAL INFORMATION RELEVANT
TO INTERPRETING ARTICLE 2 OF THE UN FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE
capabilities. Actions beyond "no regrets18" measures impose costs
on the present generation. Mitigation policies unavoidably raise
issues about how to share the costs. The initial emission limitation
intentions of Annex I Parties represent an agreed collective first step
of those parties in addressing climate change.

6.8
There are substantial variations both among developed and
developing countries that are relevant to the application of equity principles to mitigation. These include variations in historical and
cumulative emissions, current total and per-capita emissions, emission
intensities and economic output, projections of future emissions and
factors such as wealth, energy structures and resource endowments.

6.7
Equity arguments can support a variety of proposals to
distribute mitigation costs. Most of them seem to cluster around or
combine approaches: equal per capita emission allocations and
allocations based on incremental departures from national baseline
emissions (current or projected). The implications of climate
change for developing countries are different from those for
developed countries. The former often have different urgent
priorities, weaker institutions and are generally more vulnerable to
climate change. However, it is likely that developing countries'
share of emissions will grow further to meet their social and
developmental needs. Greenhouse gas emissions are likely to
become increasingly global, even whilst substantial per-capita
disparities are likely to remain.

6.9
A variety of ethical principles, including the importance of
meeting people's basic needs, may be relevant to addressing climate
change, but the application of principles developed to guide individual behaviour to relations among states is complex and not
straightforward. Climate change policies should not aggravate existing disparities between one region and another nor attempt to
redress all equity issues.

18 "No regrets" measures are those whose benefits, such as reduced energy

costs and reduced emissions of local/regional pollutants equal
or exceed their cost to society, excluding the benefits of climate change
mitigation. They are sometimes knows as "measures worth doing anyway".

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO PROCEED
IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER
7.1
Economic development, social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing
components of sustainable development, which is the framework
for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people. The
UNFCCC notes that responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and economic development in an integrated
manner with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on the latter,
taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing
countries for the achievement of sustainable development and the
eradication of poverty. The Convention also notes the common but
differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities of all
Parties to protect the climate system. This section reviews briefly
what is known about the costs and benefits of mitigation and adaptation measures as they relate, inter alia, to the sustainability of
economic development and environment.

7

7.3
The assessed literature quantifying total damages from 2 to
3C warming provides a wide range of point estimates for damages
given the presumed change in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The aggregate estimates tend to be a few per cent of world
GDP, with, in general, considerably higher estimates of damage to
developing countries as a share of their GDP. The aggregate estimates
are subject to considerable uncertainty, but the range of uncertainty
cannot be gauged from the literature. The range of estimates cannot
be interpreted as a confidence interval given the widely differing
assumptions and methodologies in the studies. Aggregation is likely
to mask even greater uncertainties about damage components.
Regional or sectoral approaches to estimating the consequences of
climate change include a much wider range of estimates of the net
economic effects. For some areas, damages are estimated to be significantly greater and could negatively affect economic development.
For others, climate change is estimated to increase economic production and present opportunities for economic development.
Equalizing the value of a statistical life at the level typical of that in
developed countries would increase monetized damages several
times, and would further increase the share of the developing countries in the total damage estimate. Small islands and low-lying coastal
areas are particularly vulnerable. Damages from possible large-scale
catastrophes, such as major changes in ocean circulation, are not
reflected in these estimates.

Social costs of climate change
7.2
Net climate change damages include both market and nonmarket impacts as far as they can be quantified at present and, in some
cases, adaptation costs. Damages are expressed in net terms to account
for the fact that there are some beneficial impacts of climate change
as well, which are, however, dominated by the damage costs. Nonmarket impacts, such as human health, risk of human mortality and
damage to ecosystems, form an important component of available estimates of the social costs of climate change. The estimates of
non-market damages, however, are highly speculative and not
comprehensive and are thus a source of major uncertainty in assessing the implications of global climate change for human welfare.

Benefits of limiting climate change
7.4
The benefits of limiting greenhouse gas emissions and
enhancing sinks are: (a) the climate change damages and
15

CLIMATE CHANGE 1995: IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT
adaptation costs avoided; and (b) the indirect economic and environmental benefits associated with the relevant policies -- such as
reductions in other pollutants jointly produced with greenhouse
gases, biological diversity conserved and technological innovation
driven by climate change response.

to zero net cost. With longer time horizons, which allow a more
complete turnover of capital stocks and which give research, development and demonstration, and market transformation policies a
chance to impact multiple replacement cycles, this potential is
much higher. The magnitude of such "no regrets" potential
depends upon the existence of substantial market or institutional
imperfections that prevent cost-effective emission reduction
measures from occurring. The key question is then the extent to
which such imperfections and barriers can be removed cost-effectively by policy initiatives.

Adaptation costs
7.5
Many options are available for adapting to the impacts of
climate change and thus reducing the damages to national
economies and natural ecosystems. Adaptive options are available
in many sectors, ranging from agriculture and energy to health,
coastal zone management, off-shore fisheries and recreation. Some
of these provide enhanced ability to cope with the current impacts
of climate variability. Systematic estimates of the costs of
adaptation to cope with impacts on agriculture, human health,
water supplies and other changes are not available. Where
adaptation measures are technically feasible, costs of adaptation,
for example to sea-level rise, could be prohibitively expensive for
some countries without external assistance.

7.9
OECD countries: Although it is difficult to generalize,
top-down19 analyses suggest that the costs of substantial reductions
below 1990 CO2 emissions levels could be as high as several per cent
of GDP. In the specific case of stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels,
most studies estimate that annual costs in the range of minus 0.5
per cent of GDP (equivalent to a gain of about $60 billion in total
for OECD countries at today's GDP levels) to plus 2 per cent of GDP
(equivalent to a loss of about $240 billion) could be reached over
the next several decades. However, studies also show that appropriate timing of abatement measures and the availability of low-cost
alternatives may substantially reduce the size of the overall bill.
Some bottom-up studies show that the costs of reducing emissions
by 20% in developed countries within two to three decades are
negligible to negative. Other bottom-up studies suggest that there
exists a potential for absolute reductions in excess of 50% in the
longer term, without increasing and perhaps even reducing total
energy system costs.

Mitigation costs and benefits
7.6
The costs of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases at levels and within a time-frame which will
prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate
system will be critically dependent on the choice of emissions time
path, consumption patterns, resource and technology availability
and the choice of policy instruments. The cost of the abatement
programme will be influenced by the rate of capital replacement, the
discount rate and the effect of research and development. Failure to
adopt policies as early as possible to encourage efficient replacement
investments at the end of the economic life of plant and equipment
(i.e., at the point of capital stock turnover) impose an economic cost
to society. Implementing emissions reductions at rates that can be
absorbed in the course of normal stock turnover is likely to be
cheaper than enforcing premature retirement now. The choice of
abatement paths thus involves balancing the economic risks of rapid
abatement now against the risks of delay. Mitigation measures undertaken in a way that capitalize on other environmental benefits could
be cost-effective and enhance sustainable development. Movement
of polluting activities which lead to an increase in global greenhouse
gas emissions can be lessened through coordinated actions of groups
of countries.

7.10
Countries with economies in transition: The potential
for cost-effective reductions in energy use is apt to be considerable
but the realizable potential will depend upon what economic and
technological development path is chosen, as well as the availability of capital to pursue different paths. A critical issue is the future
of structural changes in these countries that are apt to change
dramatically the level of baseline emissions and the emission reduction costs.
7.11
Developing countries: Analyses suggest that there may be
substantial low-cost fossil fuel carbon dioxide emission reduction
opportunities for developing countries. Development pathways
that increase energy efficiency, promote alternative energy technologies, reduce deforestation and enhance agricultural
productivity and biomass energy production can be economically
beneficial. To embark upon this pathway may require significant
international cooperation and financial and technology transfer.
However, these are likely to be insufficient to offset rapidly increasing emissions baselines, associated with increased economic growth
and overall welfare. Stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions is
likely to be costly.

7.7
While very few studies of the costs to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have been published,
some estimates of the costs of various degrees of emissions reductions are available in the literature. Mitigation cost estimates vary
widely, depending upon choice of methodologies, underlying
assumptions, emission scenarios, policy instruments, reporting
year, etc.
7.8
Despite significant differences in views, there is agreement
that energy efficiency gains of perhaps 10-30% above baseline
trends over the next two to three decades can be realized at negative

IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT SYNTHESIS OF SCIENTIFIC-TECHNICAL INFORMATION RELEVANT
TO INTERPRETING ARTICLE 2 OF THE UN FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE
7.12
Cost estimates for a number of specific approaches to mitigating emissions or enhancing sinks of greenhouse gases vary
widely and depend on site-specific characteristics. This is true for
renewable energy technologies, for example, as well as carbon
sequestration options. The latter could offset as much as 15-30% of
1990 global energy-related emissions each year in forests for the
next 50 years. The costs of carbon sequestration, which are competitive with source control options, differ among regions of the world.

this issue indicate that global emissions reductions of 4-18 %
together with increases in real incomes are possible from phasing
out fuel subsidies.
7.15
Progress has been made in a number of countries in costeffectively reducing imperfections and institutional barriers in
markets through policy instruments based on voluntary agreements,
energy efficiency incentives, product efficiency standards and energy
efficiency procurement programmes involving manufacturers and
utility regulatory reforms. Where empirical evaluations have been
made, many have found that the benefit-cost ratio of increasing
energy efficiency was favourable, suggesting the practical feasibility
of realizing "no regrets" potentials at negative net cost.

7.13
Control of emissions of other greenhouse gases, especially
methane and nitrous oxide, can provide significant cost-effective opportunities in some countries. About 10% of anthropogenic methane
emissions could be reduced at negative or low cost using available mitigation options for such methane sources as natural gas systems, waste
management and agriculture. Costs differ between countries and
regions for some of these options.

Value of better information and research
7.16
The value of better information about the processes,
impacts of and responses to climate change is likely to be great.
Analysis of economic and social issues related to climate change,
especially in developing countries, is a high priority for research.
Further analysis is required concerning effects of response options
on employment, inflation, trade, competitiveness and other public
issues.

Subsidies, market imperfections and barriers
7.14
The world economy and indeed some individual national
economies suffer from a number of price distortions which increase
greenhouse gas emissions, such as some agricultural and fuel subsidies and distortions in transport pricing. A number of studies of

THE ROAD FORWARD
8.1
The scientific, technical, economic and social science
literature does suggest ways to move forward towards the ultimate
objective of the Convention. Possible actions include mitigation of
climate change through reductions of emissions of greenhouse
gases and enhancement of their removal by sinks, adaptation to
observed and/or anticipated climate change, and research,
development and demonstration to improve our knowledge of the
risks of climate change and possible responses.

adaptation costs, or can increase the cost-effectiveness of emission
reduction measures. Appropriate long-run signals are required to
allow producers and consumers to adapt cost-effectively to
constraints on greenhouse gas emissions and to encourage
investment, research, development and demonstration.
8.4
Many of the policies and decisions to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases and enhance their sinks, and eventually stabilize
their atmospheric concentration, would provide opportunities and
challenges for the private and public sectors. A carefully selected
portfolio of national and international responses of actions aimed
at mitigation, adaptation and improvement of knowledge can
reduce the risks posed by climate change to ecosystems, food
security, water resources, human health and other natural and
socio-economic systems. There are large differences in the cost of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and enhancing sinks, among
countries due to their state of economic development,
infrastructure choices and natural resource base. International
cooperation in a framework of bilateral, regional or international
agreements could significantly reduce the global costs of reducing
emissions and lessening emission leakages. If carried out with care,
these responses would help to meet the challenge of climate
change and enhance the prospects for sustainable economic
development for all peoples and nations.

8.2
Uncertainties remain which are relevant to judgement of
what constitutes dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
climate system and what needs to be done to prevent such
interference. The literature indicates, however, that significant "no
regrets" opportunities are available in most countries and that the
risk of aggregate net damage due to climate change, consideration
of risk aversion and the precautionary approach, provide
rationales for actions beyond "no regrets". The challenge is not to
find the best policy today for the next 100 years, but to select a
prudent strategy and to adjust it over time in the light of new
information.
8.3
The literature suggests that flexible, cost-effective policies
relying on economic incentives and instruments as well as
coordinated instruments, can considerably reduce mitigation or

THE SCIENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE

THE SCIENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE
Considerable progress has been made in the understanding of
climate change1 science since 1990 and new data and analyses have
become available.

levels by, respectively, approximately 40, 140 or 240 years from now,
and drop substantially below 1990 levels subsequently.
* Any eventual stabilized concentration is governed more by the
accumulated anthropogenic CO2 emissions from now until the
time of stabilization than by the way those emissions change over
the period. This means that, for a given stabilized concentration
value, higher emissions in early decades require lower emissions
later on. Among the range of stabilization cases studied, for stabilization at 450, 650 or 1000 ppmv, accumulated anthropogenic
emissions over the period 1991 to 2100 are 630 GtC3, 1030 GtC
and 1410 GtC, respectively ( approximately 15% in each case).
For comparison the corresponding accumulated emissions for
IPCC IS92 emission scenarios range from 770 to 2190 GtC.
* Stabilization of CH4 and N2O concentrations at today's levels
would involve reductions in anthropogenic emissions of 8% and
more than 50% respectively.
* There is evidence that tropospheric ozone concentrations in the
Northern Hemisphere have increased since pre-industrial times
because of human activity and that this has resulted in a positive
radiative forcing. This forcing is not yet well characterized, but it is
estimated to be about 0.4 Wm-2 (15% of that from the long-lived
greenhouse gases). However, the observations of the most recent
decade show that the upward trend has slowed significantly or
stopped.

GREENHOUSE GAS CONCENTRATIONS
HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE

Increases in greenhouse gas concentrations since pre-industrial
times (i.e., since about 1750) have led to a positive radiative forcing2
of climate, tending to warm the surface and to produce other
changes of climate.
* The atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, inter alia,
carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) have
grown significantly: by about 30%, 145%, and 15%, respectively
(values for 1992). These trends can be attributed largely to human
activities, mostly fossil-fuel use, land-use change and agriculture.
* The growth rates of CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations were low
during the early 1990s. While this apparently natural variation is
not yet fully explained, recent data indicate that the growth rates are
currently comparable to those averaged over the 1980s.
* The direct radiative forcing of the long-lived greenhouse gases
(2.45 Wm-2) is due primarily to increases in the concentrations of
CO2 (1.56 Wm-2), CH4 (0.47 Wm-2) and N2O (0.14 Wm-2) (values
for 1992).
* Many greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for a long time
(for CO2 and N2O, many decades to centuries), hence they affect
radiative forcing on long time-scales.
* The direct radiative forcing due to the CFCs and HCFCs combined
is 0.25 Wm-2. However, their net radiative forcing is reduced by
about 0.1 Wm-2 because they have caused stratospheric ozone
depletion which gives rise to a negative radiative forcing.
* Growth in the concentration of CFCs, but not HCFCs, has slowed
to about zero. The concentrations of both CFCs and HCFCs, and
their consequent ozone depletion, are expected to decrease
substantially by 2050 through implementation of the Montreal
Protocol and its Adjustments and Amendments.
* At present, some long-lived greenhouse gases (particularly HFCs (a
CFC substitute), PFCs and SF6) contribute little to radiative forcing
but their projected growth could contribute several per cent to
radiative forcing during the 21st century.
* If carbon dioxide emissions were maintained at near current (1994)
levels, they would lead to a nearly constant rate of increase in atmospheric concentrations for at least two centuries, reaching about 500
ppmv (approaching twice the pre-industrial concentration of 280
ppmv) by the end of the 21st century.
* A range of carbon cycle models indicates that stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 450, 650 or 1000 ppmv could be
achieved only if global anthropogenic CO2 emissions drop to 1990

2.

ANTHROPOGENIC AEROSOLS TEND TO
PRODUCE NEGATIVE RADIATIVE FORCINGS

* Tropospheric aerosols (microscopic airborne particles) resulting
from combustion of fossil fuels, biomass burning and other
sources have led to a negative direct forcing of about 0.5 Wm-2,
as a global average, and possibly also to a negative indirect forcing
of a similar magnitude. While the negative forcing is focused in
particular regions and subcontinental areas, it can have
continental to hemispheric scale effects on climate patterns.
* Locally, the aerosol forcing can be large enough to more than
offset the positive forcing due to greenhouse gases.

1 Climate change in IPCC Working Group I usage refers to any change in

climate over time whether due to natural variability or as a result of human
activity. This differs from the usage in the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change where "climate change" refers to a change of climate which
is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate
variability observed over comparable time periods.

* In contrast to the long-lived greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosols
are very short-lived in the atmosphere, hence their radiative forcing
adjusts rapidly to increases or decreases in emissions.

3.

Since the 1990 IPCC Report, considerable progress has been
made in attempts to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic influences on climate. This progress has been achieved by
including effects of sulphate aerosols in addition to greenhouse
gases, thus leading to more realistic estimates of human-induced
radiative forcing. These have then been used in climate models to
provide more complete simulations of the human-induced climatechange `signal'. In addition, new simulations with coupled
atmosphere-ocean models have provided important information
about decade to century time-scale natural internal climate variability. A further major area of progress is the shift of focus from
studies of global-mean changes to comparisons of modelled and
observed spatial and temporal patterns of climate change.
The most important results related to the issues of detection and
attribution are:

CLIMATE HAS CHANGED OVER
THE PAST CENTURY

At any one location, year-to-year variations in weather can be large,
but analyses of meteorological and other data over large areas and
over periods of decades or more have provided evidence for some
important systematic changes.
* Global mean surface air temperature has increased by between
about 0.3 and 0.6C since the late 19th century; the additional data
available since 1990 and the re-analyses since then have not significantly changed this range of estimated increase.
* Recent years have been among the warmest since 1860, i.e., in the
period of instrumental record, despite the cooling effect of the
1991 Mt Pinatubo volcanic eruption.
* Night-time temperatures over land have generally increased more
than daytime temperatures.
* Regional changes are also evident. For example, the recent
warming has been greatest over the mid-latitude continents in
winter and spring, with a few areas of cooling, such as the North
Atlantic ocean. Precipitation has increased over land in high
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, especially during the cold
season.
* Global sea level has risen by between 10 and 25 cm over the past
100 years and much of the rise may be related to the increase in
global mean temperature.
* There are inadequate data to determine whether consistent global
changes in climate variability or weather extremes have occurred
over the 20th century. On regional scales there is clear evidence of
changes in some extremes and climate variability indicators (e.g.,
fewer frosts in several widespread areas; an increase in the proportion of rainfall from extreme events over the contiguous states of
the USA). Some of these changes have been toward greater variability; some have been toward lower variability.
* The 1990 to mid-1995 persistent warm-phase of the El NinoSouthern Oscillation (which causes droughts and floods in many
areas) was unusual in the context of the last 120 years.

4.

* The limited available evidence from proxy climate indicators
suggests that the 20th century global mean temperature is at least
as warm as any other century since at least 1400 A.D. Data prior to
1400 are too sparse to allow the reliable estimation of global mean
temperature.
* Assessments of the statistical significance of the observed global
mean surface air temperature trend over the last century have used
a variety of new estimates of natural internal and externally-forced
variability. These are derived from instrumental data, palaeodata,
simple and complex climate models, and statistical models fitted to
observations. Most of these studies have detected a significant
change and show that the observed warming trend is unlikely to be
entirely natural in origin.
* More convincing recent evidence for the attribution of a human
effect on climate is emerging from pattern-based studies, in which
the modelled climate response to combined forcing by greenhouse
gases and anthropogenic sulphate aerosols is compared with
observed geographical, seasonal and vertical patterns of
atmospheric temperature change. These studies show that such
pattern correspondences increase with time, as one would expect,
as an anthropogenic signal increases in strength. Furthermore, the
probability is very low that these correspondences could occur by
chance as a result of natural internal variability only. The vertical
patterns of change are also inconsistent with those expected for
solar and volcanic forcing.
* Our ability to quantify the human influence on global climate is
currently limited because the expected signal is still emerging from
the noise of natural variability, and because there are uncertainties
in key factors. These include the magnitude and patterns of longterm natural variability and the time-evolving pattern of forcing
by, and response to, changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases
and aerosols, and land surface changes. Nevertheless, the balance
of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on
global climate.

THE BALANCE OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS
A DISCERNIBLE HUMAN INFLUENCE
ON GLOBAL CLIMATE

Any human-induced effect on climate will be superimposed on the
background "noise" of natural climate variability, which results
both from internal fluctuations and from external causes such as
solar variability or volcanic eruptions. Detection and attribution
studies attempt to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural
influences. "Detection of change" is the process of demonstrating
that an observed change in climate is highly unusual in a statistical
sense, but does not provide a reason for the change. "Attribution" is
the process of establishing cause and effect relations, including the
testing of competing hypotheses.

CLIMATE IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE
TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE

The IPCC has developed a range of scenarios, IS92a-f, of future
greenhouse gas and aerosol precursor emissions based on
22

SUMMARY FOR POLICYMAKERS: THE SCIENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE
assumptions concerning population and economic growth, landuse, technological changes, energy availability and fuel mix during
the period 1990 to 2100. Through understanding of the global
carbon cycle and of atmospheric chemistry, these emissions can be
used to project atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and
aerosols and the perturbation of natural radiative forcing. Climate
models can then be used to develop projections of future climate.

*

*
* The increasing realism of simulations of current and past climate
by coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models has increased our
confidence in their use for projection of future climate change.
Important uncertainties remain, but these have been taken into
account in the full range of projections of global mean temperature
and sea-level change.
* For the mid-range IPCC emission scenario, IS92a, assuming the
"best estimate" value of climate sensitivity4 and including the
effects of future increases in aerosol, models project an increase in
global mean surface air temperature relative to 1990 of about 2C
by 2100. This estimate is approximately one-third lower than the
"best estimate" in 1990. This is due primarily to lower emission
scenarios (particularly for CO2 and the CFCs), the inclusion of the
cooling effect of sulphate aerosols, and improvements in the treatment of the carbon cycle. Combining the lowest IPCC emission
scenario (IS92c) with a "low" value of climate sensitivity and
including the effects of future changes in aerosol concentrations
leads to a projected increase of about 1C by 2100. The corresponding projection for the highest IPCC scenario (IS92e)
combined with a "high" value of climate sensitivity gives a
warming of about 3.5C. In all cases the average rate of warming
would probably be greater than any seen in the last 10,000 years,
but the actual annual to decadal changes would include considerable natural variability. Regional temperature changes could differ
substantially from the global mean value. Because of the thermal
inertia of the oceans, only 50-90% of the eventual equilibrium
temperature change would have been realized by 2100 and temperature would continue to increase beyond 2100, even if
concentrations of greenhouse gases were stabilized by that time.
* Average sea level is expected to rise as a result of thermal expansion
of the oceans and melting of glaciers and ice-sheets. For the IS92a
scenario, assuming the "best estimate" values of climate sensitivity
and of ice-melt sensitivity to warming, and including the effects of
future changes in aerosol, models project an increase in sea level of
about 50 cm from the present to 2100. This estimate is approximately 25% lower than the "best estimate" in 1990 due to the
lower temperature projection, but also reflecting improvements in
the climate and ice-melt models. Combining the lowest emission
scenario (IS92c) with the "low" climate and ice-melt sensitivities
and including aerosol effects gives a projected sea-level rise of
about 15 cm from the present to 2100. The corresponding projection for the highest emission scenario (IS92e) combined with
"high" climate and ice-melt sensitivities gives a sea-level rise of
about 95 cm from the present to 2100. Sea level would continue to
rise at a similar rate in future centuries beyond 2100, even if
concentrations of greenhouse gases were stabilized by that time,
and would continue to do so even beyond the time of stabilization
of global mean temperature. Regional sea-level changes may differ

from the global mean value owing to land movement and ocean
current changes.
Confidence is higher in the hemispheric-to-continental scale
projections of coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models than in
the regional projections, where confidence remains low. There is
more confidence in temperature projections than hydrological
changes.
All model simulations, whether they were forced with increased
concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols or with increased
concentrations of greenhouse gases alone, show the following
features: greater surface warming of the land than of the sea in
winter; a maximum surface warming in high northern latitudes in
winter, little surface warming over the Arctic in summer; an
enhanced global mean hydrological cycle, and increased precipitation and soil moisture in high latitudes in winter. All these changes
are associated with identifiable physical mechanisms.
In addition, most simulations show a reduction in the strength of
the north Atlantic thermohaline circulation and a widespread
reduction in diurnal range of temperature. These features too can
be explained in terms of identifiable physical mechanisms.
The direct and indirect effects of anthropogenic aerosols have an
important effect on the projections. Generally, the magnitudes of
the temperature and precipitation changes are smaller when aerosol
effects are represented, especially in northern mid-latitudes. Note
that the cooling effect of aerosols is not a simple offset to the
warming effect of greenhouse gases, but significantly affects some of
the continental scale patterns of climate change, most noticeably in
the summer hemisphere. For example, models that consider only
the effects of greenhouse gases generally project an increase in
precipitation and soil moisture in the Asian summer monsoon
region, whereas models that include, in addition, some of the effects
of aerosols suggest that monsoon precipitation may decrease. The
spatial and temporal distribution of aerosols greatly influences
regional projections, which are therefore more uncertain.
A general warming is expected to lead to an increase in the occurrence of extremely hot days and a decrease in the occurrence of
extremely cold days.
Warmer temperatures will lead to a more vigorous hydrological cycle;
this translates into prospects for more severe droughts and/or floods
in some places and less severe droughts and/or floods in other places.
Several models indicate an increase in precipitation intensity, suggesting a possibility for more extreme rainfall events. Knowledge is
currently insufficient to say whether there will be any changes in the
occurrence or geographical distribution of severe storms, e.g.,
tropical cyclones.
Sustained rapid climate change could shift the competitive balance
among species and even lead to forest dieback, altering the terrestrial
uptake and release of carbon. The magnitude is uncertain, but could
be between zero and 200 GtC over the next one to two centuries,
depending on the rate of climate change.

4 In IPCC reports, climate sensitivity usually refers to the long-term (equilib-

rium) change in global mean surface temperature following a doubling of
atmospheric equivalent CO2 concentration. More generally, it refers to the
equilibrium change in surface air temperature following a unit change in
radiative forcing (C/Wm-2).

energy balance components, hydrological cycles, ocean characteristics and ecosystem changes) for the purposes of model testing,
assessment of temporal and regional variability, and for detection
and attribution studies.

Many factors currently limit our ability to project and detect future
climate change. In particular, to reduce uncertainties further work is
needed on the following priority topics:

Future unexpected, large and rapid climate system changes (as have
occurred in the past) are, by their nature, difficult to predict. This
implies that future climate changes may also involve "surprises". In
particular, these arise from the non-linear nature of the climate
system. When rapidly forced, non-linear systems are especially
subject to unexpected behaviour. Progress can be made by investigating non-linear processes and sub-components of the climatic
system. Examples of such non-linear behaviour include rapid circulation changes in the North Atlantic and feedbacks associated with
terrestrial ecosystem changes.

SCOPE OF THE ASSESSMENT

BOX 1. ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF THE UNFCCC
(ARTICLE 2)

The charge to Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) was to review the state of knowledge
concerning the impacts of climate change on physical and ecological systems, human health and socio-economic sectors. Working
Group II also was charged with reviewing available information on
the technical and economic feasibility of a range of potential adaptation and mitigation strategies. This assessment provides scientific,
technical and economic information that can be used, inter alia, in
evaluating whether the projected range of plausible impacts constitutes "dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate
system," as referred to in Article 2 of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and in evaluating
adaptation and mitigation options that could be used in progressing
towards the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC (see Box 1).

2.

"...stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic
interference with the climate system. Such a level should be
achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to
adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production
is not threatened, and to enable economic development to
proceed in a sustainable manner."

changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols, taken together, are
projected to lead to regional and global changes in climate and
climate-related parameters such as temperature, precipitation, soil
moisture and sea level. Based on the range of sensitivities of climate
to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations reported by IPCC
Working Group I and plausible ranges of emissions (IPCC IS92; see
Table 1), climate models, taking into account greenhouse gases and
aerosols, project an increase in global mean surface temperature of
about 1-3.5C by 2100 and an associated increase in sea level of

about 15-95 cm. The reliability of regional-scale predictions is still
low and the degree to which climate variability may change is
uncertain. However, potentially serious changes have been
identified, including an increase in some regions in the incidence of
extreme high-temperature events, floods and droughts, with
resultant consequences for fires, pest outbreaks, and ecosystem
composition, structure and functioning, including primary
productivity.

Policymakers will have to decide to what degree they want to take
precautionary measures by mitigating greenhouse gas emissions
and enhancing the resilience of vulnerable systems by means of
adaptation. Uncertainty does not mean that a nation or the world
community cannot position itself better to cope with the broad
range of possible climate changes or protect against potentially
costly future outcomes. Delaying such measures may leave a
nation or the world poorly prepared to deal with adverse changes
and may increase the possibility of irreversible or very costly
consequences. Options for adapting to change or mitigating
change that can be justified for other reasons today (e.g.,
abatement of air and water pollution) and make society more
flexible or resilient to anticipated adverse effects of climate change
appear particularly desirable.

Human health, terrestrial and aquatic ecological systems, and socioeconomic systems (e.g., agriculture, forestry, fisheries and water
resources) are all vital to human development and well-being and
are all sensitive to changes in climate. Whereas many regions are
likely to experience the adverse effects of climate change -- some of
which are potentially irreversible -- some effects of climate change
are likely to be beneficial. Hence, different segments of society can
expect to confront a variety of changes and the need to adapt to
them.

VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE

Article 2 of the UNFCCC explicitly acknowledges the importance of
natural ecosystems, food production and sustainable economic
development. This report addresses the potential sensitivity,
adaptability and vulnerability of ecological and socio-economic
systems -- including hydrology and water resources management,
human infrastructure and human health -- to changes in climate
(see Box 3).

Policymakers are faced with responding to the risks posed by
anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases in the face of significant scientific uncertainties. It is appropriate to consider these
uncertainties in the context of information indicating that climateinduced environmental changes cannot be reversed quickly, if at all,
due to the long time-scales associated with the climate system (see
Box 2). Decisions taken during the next few years may limit the
range of possible policy options in the future because high nearterm emissions would require deeper reductions in the future to
meet any given target concentration. Delaying action might reduce
the overall costs of mitigation because of potential technological
advances but could increase both the rate and the eventual magnitude of climate change, hence the adaptation and damage costs.

Human-induced climate change adds an important new stress.
Human-induced climate change represents an important additional
stress, particularly to the many ecological and socio-economic
systems already affected by pollution, increasing resource demands
and nonsustainable management practices. The most vulnerable
systems are those with the greatest sensitivity to climate changes
and the least adaptability.

planned, and can be carried out in response to or in anticipation
of changes in conditions.

* Equilibration of the climate system given a stable level of greenhouse gas concentrations: Decades to centuries
* Equilibration of sea level given a stable climate: Centuries

Vulnerability defines the extent to which climate change may
damage or harm a system. It depends not only on a system's sensitivity but also on its ability to adapt to new climatic conditions.

* Restoration/rehabilitation of damaged or disturbed ecological
systems: Decades to centuries

Both the magnitude and the rate of climate change are important in determining the sensitivity, adaptability and vulnerability
of a system.

(some changes, such as species extinction, are irreversible, and it
may be impossible to reconstruct and re-establish some disturbed
ecosystems)

SUMMARY FOR POLICYMAKERS: SCIENTIFIC-TECHNICAL ANALYSES OF
IMPACTS, ADAPTATIONS AND MITIGATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE
Most systems are sensitive to climate change. Natural ecological
systems, socio-economic systems and human health are all sensitive
to both the magnitude and the rate of climate change.

Detection will be difficult and unexpected changes cannot be
ruled out. Unambiguous detection of climate-induced changes in
most ecological and social systems will prove extremely difficult in
the coming decades. This is because of the complexity of these
systems, their many non-linear feedbacks, and their sensitivity to a
large number of climatic and non-climatic factors, all of which are
expected to continue to change simultaneously. The development
of a baseline projecting future conditions without climate change is
crucial, for it is this baseline against which all projected impacts are
measured. As future climate extends beyond the boundaries of
empirical knowledge (i.e., the documented impacts of climate variation in the past), it becomes more likely that actual outcomes will
include surprises and unanticipated rapid changes.

Impacts are difficult to quantify and existing studies are limited
in scope. Although our knowledge has increased significantly during
the last decade, and qualitative estimates can be developed, quantitative projections of the impacts of climate change on any particular
system at any particular location are difficult because regional-scale
climate change predictions are uncertain; our current understanding
of many critical processes is limited; and systems are subject to multiple climatic and non-climatic stresses, the interactions of which are
not always linear or additive. Most impact studies have assessed how
systems would respond to climate change resulting from an arbitrary
doubling of equivalent atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Furthermore, very few studies have considered dynamic
responses to steadily increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases;
fewer still have examined the consequences of increases beyond a
doubling of equivalent atmospheric CO2 concentrations or assessed
the implications of multiple stress factors.

Further research and monitoring are essential. Enhanced support
for research and monitoring, including cooperative efforts from
national, international and multi-lateral institutions, is essential in
order to improve significantly regional-scale climate projections;
understand the responses of human health, ecological and socioeconomic systems to changes in climate and other stress factors;
and improve our understanding of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of adaptation strategies.

Successful adaptation depends upon technological advances,
institutional arrangements, availability of financing and information exchange. Technological advances generally have
increased adaptation options for managed systems such as agriculture and water supply. However, many regions of the world
currently have limited access to these technologies and appropriate
information. The efficacy and cost-effective use of adaptation strategies will depend upon the availability of financial resources,
technology transfer, and cultural, educational, managerial, institutional, legal and regulatory practices, both domestic and
international in scope. Incorporating climate-change concerns into
resource-use and development decisions and plans for regularly
scheduled investments in infrastructure will facilitate adaptation.

3.1

Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems

Ecosystems contain the Earth's entire reservoir of genetic and species
diversity and provide many goods and services critical to individuals
and societies. These goods and services include: (i) providing food,
fibre, medicines and energy; (ii) processing and storing carbon and
other nutrients; (iii) assimilating wastes, purifying water, regulating
water runoff, and controlling floods, soil degradation and beach
erosion; and (iv) providing opportunities for recreation and tourism.
These systems and the functions they provide are sensitive to the rate
and extent of changes in climate. Figure 1 illustrates that mean
annual temperature and mean annual precipitation can be correlated
with the distribution of the world's major biomes.

Vulnerability increases as adaptive capacity decreases. The vulnerability of human health and socio-economic systems --and, to a lesser
extent, ecological systems -- depends upon economic circumstances
and institutional infrastructure. This implies that systems typically are
more vulnerable in developing countries where economic and institutional circumstances are less favourable. People who live on arid or
semi-arid lands, in low-lying coastal areas, in water-limited or floodprone areas, or on small islands are particularly vulnerable to climate
change. Some regions have become more vulnerable to hazards such
as storms, floods and droughts as a result of increasing population
density in sensitive areas such as river basins and coastal plains. Human
activities, which fragment many landscapes, have increased the
vulnerability of lightly managed and unmanaged ecosystems.
Fragmentation limits natural adaptation potential and the potential
effectiveness of measures to assist adaptation in these systems, such as
the provision of migration corridors. A changing climate's near-term
effects on ecological and socio-economic systems most likely will result
from changes in the intensity and seasonal and geographic distribution
of common weather hazards such as storms, floods and droughts. In
most of these examples, vulnerability can be reduced by strengthening adaptive capacity.

The composition and geographic distribution of many ecosystems
will shift as individual species respond to changes in climate; there
will likely be reductions in biological diversity and in the goods and
services that ecosystems provide society. Some ecological systems
may not reach a new equilibrium for several centuries after the
climate achieves a new balance.
Forests. Models project that a sustained increase of 1C in global
mean temperature is sufficient to cause changes in regional climates
that will affect the growth and regeneration capacity of forests in
many regions. In several instances this will alter the function and
composition of forests significantly. As a consequence of possible
changes in temperature and water availability under doubled
equivalent-CO2 equilibrium conditions, a substantial fraction (a
global average of one-third, varying by region from one-seventh to
two-thirds) of the existing forested area of the world will undergo
major changes in broad vegetation types -- with the greatest
changes occurring in high latitudes and the least in the tropics.
29

CLIMATE CHANGE 1995: IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT

Deserts and desertification. Deserts are likely to become more
extreme -- in that, with few exceptions, they are projected to
become hotter but not significantly wetter. Temperature increases
could be a threat to organisms that exist near their heat-tolerance
limits. The impacts on water balance, hydrology and vegetation are
uncertain. Desertification, as defined by the UN Convention to
Combat Desertification, is land degradation in arid, semi-arid and
dry sub-humid areas resulting from various factors, including
climatic variations and human activities. Desertification is more
likely to become irreversible if the environment becomes drier and
the soil becomes further degraded through erosion and compaction.
Adaptation to drought and desertification may rely on the development of diversified production systems.
Cryosphere. Models project that between one-third and one-half of
existing mountain glacier mass could disappear over the next 100
years. The reduced extent of glaciers and depth of snow cover also
would affect the seasonal distribution of river flow and water supply
for hydroelectric generation and agriculture. Anticipated hydrological
changes and reductions in the areal extent and depth of permafrost
could lead to large-scale damage to infrastructure, an additional flux
of CO2 into the atmosphere and changes in processes that contribute
to the flux of methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. Reduced sea-ice
extent and thickness would increase the seasonal duration of navigation on rivers and in coastal areas that are presently affected by
seasonal ice cover and may increase navigability in the Arctic Ocean.
Little change in the extent of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets
is expected over the next 50-100 years.

Rangelands. In tropical rangelands, mean temperature increases should
not lead to major alterations in productivity and species composition,
but altered rainfall amount and seasonality and increased evapotranspiration will. Increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration may raise
the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of forage for herbivores, thus reducing its
food value. Shifts in temperature and precipitation in temperate rangelands may result in altered growing seasons and boundary shifts
between grasslands, forests and shrublands.

Climate change is expected to occur at a rapid rate relative to the
speed at which forest species grow, reproduce and re-establish
themselves. For mid-latitude regions, a global average warming of
1-3.5C over the next 100 years would be equivalent to a poleward
shift of the present isotherms by approximately 150-550 km or an
altitude shift of about 150-550 m; in low latitudes, temperatures
would generally be increased to higher levels than now exist. This
compares to past tree species migration rates that are believed to be
on the order of 4-200 km per century. Therefore, the species
composition of forests is likely to change; entire forest types may
disappear, while new assemblages of species, hence new ecosystems,
may be established. Figure 2 depicts potential distribution of biomes
under current and a doubled equivalent-CO2 climate. Although net
primary productivity could increase, the standing biomass of forests
may not because of more frequent outbreaks and extended ranges of
pests and pathogens, and increasing frequency and intensity of
fires. Large amounts of carbon could be released into the
atmosphere during transitions from one forest type to another
because the rate at which carbon can be lost during times of high
forest mortality is greater than the rate at which it can be gained
through growth to maturity.

Mountain regions. The projected decrease in the extent of
mountain glaciers, permafrost and snow cover caused by a
warmer climate will affect hydrologic systems, soil stability and
related socio-economic systems. The altitudinal distribution of
vegetation is projected to shift to higher elevation; some species
with climatic ranges limited to mountain tops could become
extinct because of disappearance of habitat or reduced migration
potential. Mountain resources such as food and fuel for indigenous
populations may be disrupted in many developing countries.
Recreational industries -- of increasing economic importance to
many regions -- also are likely to be disrupted.

Mean Annual Precipitation (mm)

Figure 1. This figure illustrates that mean annual temperature and
mean annual precipitation can be correlated with the distribution
of the world's major biomes. While the role of these annual means
in affecting this distribution is important, it should be noted that
the distribution of biomes may also strongly depend on seasonal
factors such as the length of the dry season or the lowest absolute
minimum temperature, on soil properties such as water-holding
capacity, on land-use history such as agriculture or grazing and on
disturbance regimes such as the frequency of fire.

Lakes, streams and wetlands. Inland aquatic ecosystems will be
influenced by climate change through altered water temperatures,
flow regimes and water levels. In lakes and streams, warming would
have the greatest biological effects at high latitudes, where biological productivity would increase, and at the low-latitude boundaries
of cold- and cool-water species ranges, where extinctions would be

greatest. Warming of larger and deeper temperate zone lakes would
increase their productivity; although in some shallow lakes and in
streams, warming could increase the likelihood of anoxic conditions. Increases in flow variability, particularly the frequency and
duration of large floods and droughts, would tend to reduce water
quality and biological productivity and habitat in streams. Water-

level declines will be most severe in lakes and streams in dry evaporative drainages and in basins with small catchments. The
geographical distribution of wetlands is likely to shift with changes
in temperature and precipitation. There will be an impact of climate
change on greenhouse gas release from non-tidal wetlands, but
there is uncertainty regarding the exact effects from site to site.
31

CLIMATE CHANGE 1995: IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT
Coastal systems. Coastal systems are economically and ecologically
important and are expected to vary widely in their response to
changes in climate and sea level. Climate change and a rise in sea
level or changes in storms or storm surges could result in the erosion
of shores and associated habitat, increased salinity of estuaries and
freshwater aquifers, altered tidal ranges in rivers and bays, changes in
sediment and nutrient transport, a change in the pattern of chemical and microbiological contamination in coastal areas, and increased
coastal flooding. Some coastal ecosystems are particularly at risk,
including saltwater marshes, mangrove ecosystems, coastal wetlands,
coral reefs, coral atolls and river deltas. Changes in these ecosystems
would have major negative effects on tourism, freshwater supplies,
fisheries and biodiversity. Such impacts would add to modifications
in the functioning of coastal oceans and inland waters that already
have resulted from pollution, physical modification and material
inputs due to human activities.

The quantity and quality of water supplies already are serious
problems today in many regions, including some low-lying coastal
areas, deltas and small islands, making countries in these regions
particularly vulnerable to any additional reduction in indigenous
water supplies. Water availability currently falls below 1,000 m3 per
person per year -- a common benchmark for water scarcity -- in a
number of countries (e.g., Kuwait, Jordan, Israel, Rwanda, Somalia,
Algeria, Kenya) or is expected to fall below this benchmark in the
next two to three decades (e.g., Libya, Egypt, South Africa, Iran,
Ethiopia). In addition, a number of countries in conflict-prone areas
are highly dependent on water originating outside their borders
(e.g., Cambodia, Syria, Sudan, Egypt, Iraq).
The impacts of climate change will depend on the baseline
condition of the water supply system and the ability of water
resource managers to respond not only to climate change but also to
population growth and changes in demands, technology, and
economic, social and legislative conditions. In some cases --
particularly in wealthier countries with integrated watermanagement systems -- improved management may protect water
users from climate change at minimal cost; in many others,
however, there could be substantial economic, social and
environmental costs, particularly in regions that already are waterlimited and where there is considerable competition among users.
Experts disagree over whether water supply systems will evolve
substantially enough in the future to compensate for the
anticipated negative impacts of climate change on water resources
and for potential increases in demand.

Oceans. Climate change will lead to changes in sea level, increasing
it on average, and also could lead to altered ocean circulation,
vertical mixing, wave climate and reductions in sea-ice cover. As a
result, nutrient availability, biological productivity, the structure
and functions of marine ecosystems, and heat and carbon storage
capacity may be affected, with important feedbacks to the climate
system. These changes would have implications for coastal regions,
fisheries, tourism and recreation, transport, off-shore structures and
communication. Paleoclimatic data and model experiments suggest
that abrupt climatic changes can occur if freshwater influx from the
movement and melting of sea ice or ice sheets significantly weakens
global thermohaline circulation.

3.2

Options for dealing with the possible impacts of a changed climate
and increased uncertainty about future supply and demand for
freshwater include more efficient management of existing supplies
and infrastructure; institutional arrangements to limit future
demands/promote conservation; improved monitoring and
forecasting systems for floods/droughts; rehabilitation of
watersheds, especially in the tropics; and construction of new
reservoir capacity to capture and store excess flows produced by
altered patterns of snowmelt and storms.

Hydrology and water resources management

Climate change will lead to an intensification of the global
hydrological cycle and can have major impacts on regional water
resources. A change in the volume and distribution of water will
affect both ground and surface water supply for domestic and
industrial uses, irrigation, hydropower generation, navigation,
instream ecosystems and water-based recreation.
Changes in the total amount of precipitation and in its frequency
and intensity directly affect the magnitude and timing of runoff
and the intensity of floods and droughts; however, at present,
specific regional effects are uncertain. Relatively small changes in
temperature and precipitation, together with the non-linear
effects on evapotranspiration and soil moisture, can result in
relatively large changes in runoff, especially in arid and semi-arid
regions. High-latitude regions may experience increased runoff due
to increased precipitation, whereas runoff may decrease at lower
latitudes due to the combined effects of increased
evapotranspiration and decreased precipitation. More intense
rainfall would tend to increase runoff and the risk of flooding,
although this would depend not only on the change in rainfall but
also on catchment physical and biological characteristics. A
warmer climate could decrease the proportion of precipitation
falling as snow, leading to reductions in spring runoff and
increases in winter runoff.

3.3

Food and fibre

Agriculture. Crop yields and changes in productivity due to climate
change will vary considerably across regions and among localities,
thus changing the patterns of production. Productivity is projected to
increase in some areas and decrease in others, especially the tropics
and subtropics (Table 2). However, existing studies show that on the
whole global agricultural production could be maintained relative to
baseline production in the face of climate change modeled by general
circulation models (GCMs) at doubled equivalent-CO2 equilibrium
conditions, but that regional effects would vary widely. This conclusion takes into account the beneficial effects of CO2 fertilization, but
does not allow for changes in agricultural pests and the possible
effects of changing climatic variability.
Focusing on global agricultural production does not address the
potentially serious consequences of large differences at local and

regional scales, even at mid-latitudes. There may be increased risk of
hunger and famine in some locations; many of the world's poorest
people -- particularly those living in subtropical and tropical areas
and dependent on isolated agricultural systems in semi-arid and
arid regions -- are most at risk of increased hunger. Many of these
at-risk populations are found in sub-Saharan Africa; south, east and

southeast Asia; and tropical areas of Latin America, as well as some
Pacific island nations.
Adaptation -- such as changes in crops and crop varieties, improved
water-management and irrigation systems, and changes in planting
schedules and tillage practices -- will be important in limiting
33

CLIMATE CHANGE 1995: IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT
negative effects and taking advantage of beneficial changes in
climate. The extent of adaptation depends on the affordability of
such measures, particularly in developing countries; access to
know-how and technology; the rate of climate change; and
biophysical constraints such as water availability, soil characteristics
and crop genetics. The incremental costs of adaptation strategies
could create a serious burden for developing countries; some
adaptation strategies may result in cost savings for some countries.
There are significant uncertainties about the capacity of different
regions to adapt successfully to projected climate change.

sudden changes, surprises and increased frequency or intensity of
extreme events. The subsectors and activities most sensitive to
climate change include agroindustry, energy demand, production of
renewable energy such as hydroelectricity and biomass, construction, some transportation activities, existing flood mitigation
structures, and transportation infrastructure located in many areas,
including vulnerable coastal zones and permafrost regions.
Climate change clearly will increase the vulnerability of some
coastal populations to flooding and erosional land loss. Estimates
put about 46 million people per year currently at risk of flooding
due to storm surges. This estimate results from multiplying the total
number of people currently living in areas potentially affected by
ocean flooding by the probability of flooding at these locations in
any year, given the present protection levels and population
density. In the absence of adaptation measures, a 50-cm sea-level
rise would increase this number to about 92 million; a 1-m sea-level
rise would raise it to 118 million. If one incorporates anticipated
population growth, the estimates increase substantially. Some small
island nations and other countries will confront greater vulnerability because their existing sea and coastal defense systems are less
well-established. Countries with higher population densities would
be more vulnerable. For these countries, sea-level rise could force
internal or international migration of populations.

Livestock production may be affected by changes in grain prices and
rangeland and pasture productivity. In general, analyses indicate
that intensively managed livestock systems have more potential for
adaptation than crop systems. This may not be the case in pastoral
systems, where the rate of technology adoption is slow and changes
in technology are viewed as risky.
Forest products. Global wood supplies during the next century may
become increasingly inadequate to meet projected consumption due
to both climatic and non-climatic factors. Boreal forests are likely to
undergo irregular and large-scale losses of living trees because of the
impacts of projected climate change. Such losses could initially
generate additional wood supply from salvage harvests, but could
severely reduce standing stocks and wood-product availability over
the long term. The exact timing and extent of this pattern is uncertain. Climate and land-use impacts on the production of temperate
forest products are expected to be relatively small. In tropical regions,
the availability of forest products is projected to decline by about half
for non-climatic reasons related to human activities.

A number of studies have evaluated sensitivity to a 1-m sea-level
rise. This increase is at the top of the range of IPCC Working Group
I estimates for 2100; it should be noted, however, that sea level is
actually projected to continue to rise beyond 2100. Studies using
this 1-m projection show a particular risk for small islands and
deltas. Estimated land losses range from 0.05% for Uruguay, 1% for
Egypt, 6% for the Netherlands and 17.5% for Bangladesh to about
80% for the Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands, given the present
state of protection systems. Large numbers of people also are
affected -- for example, about 70 million each in China and
Bangladesh. Many nations face lost capital value in excess of 10% of
their gross domestic product (GDP). Although annual protection
costs for many nations are relatively modest (about 0.1% of GDP),
the average annual costs to many small island states total several per
cent of GDP. For some island nations, the high cost of providing
storm-surge protection would make it essentially infeasible,
especially given the limited availability of capital for investment.

Fisheries. Climate-change effects interact with those of pervasive
overfishing, diminishing nursery areas, and extensive inshore and
coastal pollution. Globally, marine fisheries production is expected
to remain about the same; high-latitude freshwater and aquaculture
production are likely to increase, assuming that natural climate variability and the structure and strength of ocean currents remain about
the same. The principal impacts will be felt at the national and local
levels as species mix and centres of production shift. The positive
effects of climate change -- such as longer growing seasons, lower
natural winter mortality and faster growth rates in higher latitudes --
may be offset by negative factors such as changes in established
reproductive patterns, migration routes and ecosystem relationships.

3.4

The most vulnerable human settlements are located in damageprone areas of the developing world that do not have the resources
to cope with impacts. Effective coastal-zone management and landuse regulation can help direct population shifts away from
vulnerable locations such as flood plains, steep hillsides and lowlying coastlines. One of the potentially unique and destructive
effects on human settlements is forced internal or international
migration of populations. Programmes of disaster assistance can
offset some of the more serious negative consequences of climate
change and reduce the number of ecological refugees.

Human infrastructure

Climate change and resulting sea-level rise can have a number of
negative impacts on energy, industry and transportation infrastructure; human settlements; the property insurance industry; tourism;
and cultural systems and values.
In general, the sensitivity of the energy, industry and transportation
sectors is relatively low compared to that of agricultural or natural
ecosystems, and the capacity for adaptation through management
and normal replacement of capital is expected to be high. However,
infrastructure and activities in these sectors would be susceptible to

Property insurance is vulnerable to extreme climate events. A higher
risk of extreme events due to climate change could lead to higher

3.5

insurance premiums or the withdrawal of coverage for property in
some vulnerable areas. Changes in climate variability and the risk
for extreme events may be difficult to detect or predict, thus making
it difficult for insurance companies to adjust premiums
appropriately. If such difficulty leads to insolvency, companies may
not be able to honour insurance contracts, which could
economically weaken other sectors, such as banking. The insurance
industry currently is under stress from a series of "billion dollar"
storms since 1987, resulting in dramatic increases in losses, reduced
availability of insurance and higher costs. Some in the insurance
industry perceive a current trend toward increased frequency and
severity of extreme climate events. Examination of the
meteorological data fails to support this perception in the context of
a long-term change, although a shift within the limits of natural
variability may have occurred. Higher losses strongly reflect
increases in infrastructure and economic worth in vulnerable areas
as well as a possible shift in the intensity and frequency of extreme
weather events.

Human health

Climate change is likely to have wide-ranging and mostly adverse
impacts on human health, with significant loss of life. These impacts
would arise by both direct and indirect pathways (Figure 3) and it is
likely that the indirect impacts would, in the longer term, predominate.
Direct health effects include increases in (predominantly cardiorespiratory) mortality and illness due to an anticipated increase in
the intensity and duration of heat waves. Temperature increases in
colder regions should result in fewer cold-related deaths. An
increase in extreme weather would cause a higher incidence of
death, injury, psychological disorders and exposure to contaminated water supplies.
Indirect effects of climate change include increases in the potential
transmission of vector-borne infectious diseases (e.g., malaria,
dengue, yellow fever and some viral encephalitis) resulting from

extensions of the geographical range and season for vector organisms. Projections by models (that entail necessary simplifying
assumptions) indicate that the geographical zone of potential
malaria transmission in response to world temperature increases at
the upper part of the IPCC-projected range (3-5C by 2100) would
increase from approximately 45% of the world population to
approximately 60% by the latter half of the next century. This could
lead to potential increases in malaria incidence (on the order of
50-80 million additional annual cases, relative to an assumed global
background total of 500 million cases), primarily in tropical,
subtropical and less well-protected temperate-zone populations.
Some increases in non-vector-borne infectious diseases -- such as
salmonellosis, cholera and giardiasis -- also could occur as a result
of elevated temperatures and increased flooding.

mitigation measures. Discussion of macroeconomic analyses is
found in the IPCC Working Group III contribution to the Second
Assessment Report. The degree to which technical potential and
cost-effectiveness are realized is dependent on initiatives to counter
lack of information and overcome cultural, institutional, legal,
financial and economic barriers that can hinder diffusion of technology or behavioral changes. The pursuit of mitigation options can
be carried out within the limits of sustainable development criteria.
Social and environmental criteria not related to greenhouse gas
emissions abatement could, however, restrict the ultimate potential
of each of the options.

Additional indirect effects include respiratory and allergic disorders
due to climate-enhanced increases in some air pollutants, pollens and
mold spores. Exposure to air pollution and stressful weather events
combine to increase the likelihood of morbidity and mortality. Some
regions could experience a decline in nutritional status as a result of
adverse impacts on food and fisheries productivity. Limitations on
freshwater supplies also will have human health consequences.

Global energy demand has grown at an average annual rate of
approximately 2% for almost two centuries, although energy
demand growth varies considerably over time and between different
regions. In the published literature, different methods and conventions are used to characterize energy consumption. These
conventions differ, for example, according to their definition of
sectors and their treatment of energy forms. Based on aggregated
national energy balances, 385 EJ of primary energy was consumed
in the world in 1990, resulting in the release of 6 GtC as CO2. Of
this, 279 EJ was delivered to end users, accounting for 3.7 GtC emissions as CO2 at the point of consumption. The remaining 106 EJ
was used in energy conversion and distribution, accounting for 2.3
GtC emissions as CO2. In 1990, the three largest sectors of energy
consumption were industry (45% of total CO2 releases), residential/commercial sector (29%) and transport (21%). Of these,
transport sector energy use and related CO2 emissions have been
the most rapidly growing over the past two decades. For the detailed
sectoral mitigation option assessment in this report, 1990 energy
consumption estimates are based on a range of literature sources; a
variety of conventions are used to define these sectors and their
energy use, which is estimated to amount to a total of 259-282 EJ.

4.1

Quantifying the projected impacts is difficult because the extent of
climate-induced health disorders depends on numerous coexistent and
interacting factors that characterize the vulnerability of the particular
population, including environmental and socio-economic circumstances, nutritional and immune status, population density and access
to quality health care services. Adaptive options to reduce health
impacts include protective technology (e.g., housing, air conditioning,
water purification and vaccination), disaster preparedness and appropriate health care.

OPTIONS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND
ENHANCE SINKS OF GREENHOUSE GASES

Human activities are directly increasing the atmospheric concentrations of several greenhouse gases, especially CO2, CH4,
halocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrous oxide (N2O). CO2
is the most important of these gases, followed by CH4. Human
activities also indirectly affect concentrations of water vapour and
ozone. Significant reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions are
technically possible and can be economically feasible. These reductions can be achieved by utilizing an extensive array of technologies
and policy measures that accelerate technology development, diffusion and transfer in all sectors including the energy, industry,
transportation, residential/commercial and agricultural/forestry
sectors. By the year 2100, the world's commercial energy system in
effect will be replaced at least twice, offering opportunities to
change the energy system without premature retirement of capital
stock; significant amounts of capital stock in the industrial,
commercial, residential and agricultural/forestry sectors will also be
replaced. These cycles of capital replacement provide opportunities
to use new, better performing technologies. It should be noted that
the analyses of Working Group II do not attempt to quantify potential macroeconomic consequences that may be associated with

Energy, industrial process and human
settlement emissions

Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
nations have been and remain major energy users and fossil-fuel CO2
emitters, although their share of global fossil fuel carbon emissions has
been declining. Developing nations, taken as a group, still account for
a smaller portion of total global CO2 emissions than industrialized
nations -- OECD and former Soviet Union/Eastern Europe (FSU/EE) --
but most projections indicate that with forecast rates of economic and
population growth, the future share of developing countries will
increase. Future energy demand is anticipated to continue to grow, at
least through the first half of the next century. The IPCC (1992, 1994)
projects that without policy intervention, there could be significant
growth in emissions from the industrial, transportation and commercial/ residential buildings sectors.

parts of the world through technical conservation measures and
improved management practices over the next two to three
decades. Using technologies that presently yield the highest output
of energy services for a given input of energy, efficiency gains of
50-60% would be technically feasible in many countries over the
same time period. Achieving these potentials will depend on future
cost reductions, financing and technology transfer, as well as
measures to overcome a variety of non-technical barriers. The
potential for greenhouse gas emission reductions exceeds the potential for energy use efficiency because of the possibility of switching
fuels and energy sources. Because energy use is growing worldwide,
even replacing current technology with more efficient technology
could still lead to an absolute increase in CO2 emissions in the
future.

consumption increases to 2025 without new measures are broadly
consistent with those of IS92. If past trends continue, greenhouse
gas emissions will grow more slowly than energy use, except in the
transport sector.
The following paragraphs summarize energy-efficiency improvement potentials estimated in the IPCC Second Assessment Report.
Strong policy measures would be required to achieve these potentials. Energy-related greenhouse gas emission reductions depend on
the source of the energy, but reductions in energy use will in general
lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
Industry. Energy use in 1990 was estimated to be 98-117 EJ and
is projected to grow to 140-242 EJ in 2025 without new measures.
Countries differ widely in their current industrial energy use and
energy-related greenhouse gas emission trends. Industrial sector
energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in most industrialized
countries are expected to be stable or decreasing as a result of
industrial restructuring and technological innovation, whereas
industrial emissions in developing countries are projected to
increase mainly as a result of industrial growth. The short-term
potential for energy-efficiency improvements in the
manufacturing sector of major industrial countries is estimated to
be 25%. The potential for greenhouse gas emission reductions is

In 1992, the IPCC produced six scenarios (IS92a-f) of future energy
use and associated greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC, 1992, 1995).
These scenarios provide a wide range of possible future greenhouse
gas emission levels, without mitigation measures.
In the Second Assessment Report, future energy use has been reexamined on a more detailed sectoral basis, both with and without
new mitigation measures, based on existing studies. Despite different assessment approaches, the resulting ranges of energy
37

larger. Technologies and measures for reducing energy-related
emissions from this sector include improving efficiency (e.g.,
energy and materials savings, co-generation, energy cascading,
steam recovery, and use of more efficient motors and other
electrical devices); recycling materials and switching to those with
lower greenhouse gas emissions; and developing processes that use
less energy and materials.

This assessment focuses on new technologies for capital investment
and not on potential retrofitting of existing capital stock to use less
carbon-intensive forms of primary energy. It is technically possible to
realize deep emissions reductions in the energy supply sector in step
with the normal timing of investments to replace infrastructure and
equipment as it wears out or becomes obsolete. Many options for
achieving these deep reductions will also decrease the emissions of
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds.
Promising approaches, not ordered according to priority, are
described below.

Transportation. Energy use in 1990 was estimated to be 61-65 EJ
and is projected to grow to 90-140 EJ in 2025 without new
measures. Projected energy use in 2025 could be reduced by about a
third to 60-100 EJ through vehicles using very efficient drive-trains,
lightweight construction and low air-resistance design, without
compromising comfort and performance. Further energy-use
reductions are possible through the use of smaller vehicles; altered
land-use patterns, transport systems, mobility patterns and
lifestyles; and shifting to less energy-intensive transport modes.
Greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy used could be reduced
through the use of alternative fuels and electricity from renewable
sources. These measures, taken together, provide the opportunity
for reducing global transport energy-related greenhouse gas
emissions by as much as 40% of projected emissions by 2025.
Actions to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions from
transport can simultaneously address other problems such as local
air pollution.

4.1.3.1

Greenhouse gas reductions in the use of fossil fuels

More efficient conversion of fossil fuels. New technology offers
considerably increased conversion efficiencies. For example, the efficiency of power production can be increased from the present world
average of about 30% to more than 60% in the longer term. Also, the
use of combined heat and power production replacing separate
production of power and heat --whether for process heat or space
heating -- offers a significant rise in fuel conversion efficiency.
Switching to low-carbon fossil fuels and suppressing emissions.
Switching from coal to oil or natural gas, and from oil to natural gas,
can reduce emissions. Natural gas has the lowest CO2 emissions per
unit of energy of all fossil fuels at about 14 kg C/GJ, compared to oil
with about 20 kg C/GJ and coal with about 25 kg C/GJ. The lower
carbon-containing fuels can, in general, be converted with higher
efficiency than coal. Large resources of natural gas exist in many
areas. New, low capital cost, highly efficient combined-cycle technology has reduced electricity costs considerably in some areas.
Natural gas could potentially replace oil in the transportation
sector. Approaches exist to reduce emissions of CH4 from natural
gas pipelines and emissions of CH4 and/or CO2 from oil and gas
wells and coal mines.

Commercial/Residential Sector. Energy use in 1990 was estimated
to be about 100 EJ and is projected to grow to 165-205 EJ in 2025
without new measures. Projected energy use could be reduced by
about a quarter to 126-170 EJ by 2025 without diminishing services
through the use of energy efficient technology. The potential for
greenhouse gas emission reductions is larger. Technical changes
might include reduced heat transfers through building structures
and more efficient space-conditioning and water supply systems,
lighting and appliances. Ambient temperatures in urban areas can
be reduced through increased vegetation and greater reflectivity of
building surfaces, reducing the energy required for space
conditioning. Energy-related greenhouse gas emission reductions
beyond those obtained through reduced energy use could be
achieved through changes in energy sources.

4.1.2

Energy supply

Decarbonization of flue gases and fuels and CO2 storage. The
removal and storage of CO2 from fossil fuel power-station stack
gases is feasible, but reduces the conversion efficiency and significantly increases the production cost of electricity. Another
approach to decarbonization uses fossil fuel feedstocks to make
hydrogen-rich fuels. Both approaches generate a byproduct stream
of CO2 that could be stored, for example, in depleted natural gas
fields. The future availability of conversion technologies such as fuel
cells that can efficiently use hydrogen would increase the relative
attractiveness of the latter approach. For some longer term CO2
storage options, the costs, environmental effects and efficacy of
such options remain largely unknown.

Mitigating industrial process and
human settlement emissions

Process-related greenhouse gases including CO2, CH4, N2O,
halocarbons and SF6 are released during manufacturing and
industrial processes, such as the production of iron, steel,
aluminum, ammonia, cement and other materials. Large reductions
are possible in some cases. Measures include modifying production
processes, eliminating solvents, replacing feedstocks, materials
substitution, increased recycling and reduced consumption of
greenhouse gas-intensive materials. Capturing and utilizing CH4
from landfills and sewage treatment facilities and lowering the
leakage rate of halocarbon refrigerants from mobile and stationary
sources also can lead to significant greenhouse gas emission
reductions.

4.1.3.2

Switching to non-fossil fuel sources of energy

Switching to nuclear energy. Nuclear energy could replace baseload
fossil fuel electricity generation in many parts of the world if generally
acceptable responses can be found to concerns such as reactor safety,
radioactive-waste transport and disposal, and nuclear proliferation.
38

SUMMARY FOR POLICYMAKERS: SCIENTIFIC-TECHNICAL ANALYSES OF
IMPACTS, ADAPTATIONS AND MITIGATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE
2100 (see Figure 6). Cumulative CO2 emissions, from 1990 to 2100,
would range from about 450 to about 470 GtC in the alternative
LESS constructions.
* Higher energy efficiency is underscored for achieving deep reductions
in CO2 emissions, for increasing the flexibility of supply side combinations, and for reducing overall energy system costs.
* Interregional trade in energy grows in the LESS constructions
compared to today's levels, expanding sustainable development
options for Africa, Latin America and the Middle East during the
next century.

Switching to renewable sources of energy. Solar, biomass, wind,
hydro and geothermal technologies already are widely used. In
1990, renewable sources of energy contributed about 20% of the
world's primary energy consumption, most of it fuelwood and
hydropower. Technological advances offer new opportunities and
declining costs for energy from these sources. In the longer term,
renewable sources of energy could meet a major part of the world's
demand for energy. Power systems can easily accommodate
limited fractions of intermittent generation, and with the addition
of fast-responding backup and storage units, also higher fractions.
Where biomass is sustainably regrown and used to displace fossil
fuels in energy production, net carbon emissions are avoided as
the CO2 released in converting the biomass to energy is again fixed
in biomass through photosynthesis. If the development of biomass
energy can be carried out in ways that effectively address concerns
about other environmental issues and competition with other land
uses, biomass could make major contributions in both the
electricity and fuels markets, as well as offering prospects of
increasing rural employment and income.

4.1.4

Costs for energy services in each LESS variant relative to costs for
conventional energy depend on relative future energy prices, which
are uncertain within a wide range, and on the performance and cost
characteristics assumed for alternative technologies. However,
within the wide range of future energy prices, one or more of the
variants would plausibly be capable of providing the demanded
energy services at estimated costs that are approximately the same
as estimated future costs for current conventional energy. It is not
possible to identify a least-cost future energy system for the longer
term, as the relative costs of options depend on resource constraints
and technological opportunities that are imperfectly known, and on
actions by governments and the private sector.

Integration of energy system mitigation options

To assess the potential impact of combinations of individual
measures at the energy system level, in contrast to the level of individual technologies, variants of a Low CO2-Emitting Energy Supply
System (LESS) are described. The LESS constructions are "thought
experiments" exploring possible global energy systems.

The literature provides strong support for the feasibility of achieving
the performance and cost characteristics assumed for energy technologies in the LESS constructions, within the next two decades,
though it is impossible to be certain until the research and development is complete and the technologies have been tested in the
market. Moreover, these performance and cost characteristics
cannot be achieved without a strong and sustained investment in
research, development and demonstration (RD&D). Many of the
technologies being developed would need initial support to enter
the market, and to reach sufficient volume to lower costs to become
competitive.

The following assumptions were made: World population grows
from 5.3 billion in 1990 to 9.5 billion by 2050 and 10.5 billion by
2100. GDP grows 7-fold by 2050 (5-fold and 14-fold in industrialized and developing countries, respectively) and 25-fold by 2100
(13-fold and 70-fold in industrialized and developing countries,
respectively), relative to 1990. Because of emphasis on energy efficiency, primary energy consumption rises much more slowly than
GDP. The energy supply constructions were made to meet energy
demand in: (i) projections developed for the IPCC's First
Assessment Report (1990) in a low energy demand variant, where
global primary commercial energy use approximately doubles, with
no net change for industrialized countries but a 4.4-fold increase for
developing countries from 1990 to 2100; and (ii) a higher energy
demand variant, developed in the IPCC IS92a scenario where
energy demand quadruples from 1990 to 2100. The energy demand
levels of the LESS constructions are consistent with the energy
demand mitigation chapters of this Second Assessment Report.

Market penetration and continued acceptability of different energy
technologies ultimately depends on their relative cost, performance
(including environmental performance), institutional arrangements,
and regulations and policies. Because costs vary by location and application, the wide variety of circumstances creates initial opportunities
for new technologies to enter the market. Deeper understanding of the
opportunities for emissions reductions would require more detailed
analysis of options, taking into account local conditions.
Because of the large number of options, there is flexibility as to how
the energy supply system could evolve, and paths of energy system
development could be influenced by considerations other than
climate change, including political, environmental (especially
indoor and urban air pollution, acidification and land restoration)
and socio-economic circumstances.

Figure 5 shows combinations of different energy sources to meet
changing levels of demand over the next century. The analysis of
these variants leads to the following conclusions:
* Deep reductions of CO2 emissions from energy supply systems
are technically possible within 50 to 100 years, using alternative
strategies.
* Many combinations of the options identified in this assessment
could reduce global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels from about 6
GtC in 1990 to about 4 GtC/yr by 2050 and to about 2 GtC/yr by

4.2

Agriculture, rangelands and forestry

Beyond the use of biomass fuels to displace fossil fuels, the management of forests, agricultural lands and rangelands can play an
39

CLIMATE CHANGE 1995: IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT
important role in reducing current emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O
and in enhancing carbon sinks. A number of measures could conserve
and sequester substantial amounts of carbon (approximately 60-90
GtC in the forestry sector alone) over the next 50 years. In the forestry
sector, costs for conserving and sequestering carbon in biomass and soil
are estimated to range widely but can be competitive with other mitigation options. Factors affecting costs include opportunity costs of
land; initial costs of planting and establishment; costs of nurseries; the
cost of annual maintenance and monitoring; and transaction costs.
Direct and indirect benefits will vary with national circumstances and
could offset the costs. Other practices in the agriculture sector could
reduce emissions of other greenhouse gases such as CH4 and N2O.
Land-use and management measures include:

Regenerating natural forests
Establishing tree plantations

The net amount of carbon per unit area conserved or sequestered in
living biomass under a particular forest management practice and
present climate is relatively well understood. The most important
uncertainties associated with estimating a global value are: (i) the
amount of land suitable and available for forestation, regeneration
and/or restoration programmes; (ii) the rate at which tropical deforestation can actually be reduced; (iii) the long-term use (security) of

countries would increase availability of land for production of
biomass energy.
* Geoengineering options. Some geoengineering approaches to
counterbalance greenhouse gas-induced climate change have been
suggested (e.g., putting solar radiation reflectors in space or injecting sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere to mimic the cooling
influence of volcanic eruptions). Such approaches generally are
likely to be ineffective, expensive to sustain and/or to have serious
environmental and other effects that are in many cases poorly
understood.

Cross-sectoral issues

Cross-sectoral assessment of different combinations of mitigation
options focuses on the interactions of the full range of technologies
and practices that are potentially capable of reducing emissions of
greenhouse gases or sequestering carbon. Current analysis suggests
the following:

* Competing uses of land, water and other natural resources. A
growing population and expanding economy will increase the
demand for land and other natural resources needed to provide, inter

change will interact with the resulting intensified patterns of
resource use. Land and other resources could also be required for
mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Agricultural productivity

Policy instruments

Mitigation depends on reducing barriers to the diffusion and transfer
of technology, mobilizing financial resources, supporting capacity
building in developing countries, and other approaches to assist in the
implementation of behavioral changes and technological opportunities in all regions of the globe. The optimum mix of policies will vary
from country to country, depending upon political structure and
societal receptiveness. The leadership of national governments in
applying these policies will contribute to responding to adverse

consequences of climate change. Governments can choose policies
that facilitate the penetration of less greenhouse gas-intensive technologies and modified consumption patterns. Indeed, many countries
have extensive experience with a variety of policies that can accelerate the adoption of such technologies. This experience comes from
efforts over the past 20 to 30 years to achieve improved energy efficiency, reduce the environmental impacts of agricultural policies, and
meet conservation and environmental goals unrelated to climate
change. Policies to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions appear more
easily implemented when they are designed to address other concerns
that impede sustainable development (e.g., air pollution and soil
erosion). A number of policies, some of which may need regional or
international agreement, can facilitate the penetration of less greenhouse gas-intensive technologies and modified consumption
patterns, including:

* Putting in place appropriate institutional and structural frameworks
* Energy pricing strategies (e.g., carbon or energy taxes and reduced

* Reducing or removing other subsidies (e.g., agricultural and

INTRODUCTION

potential for irreversible damages or costs, a very long planning
horizon, long time lags between emissions and effects, wide regional
variation in causes and effects, the irreducibly global scope of the
problem, and the need to consider multiple greenhouse gases and
aerosols. Yet another complication arises from the fact that effective
protection of the climate system requires global cooperation.

Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) was restructured in November 1992 and charged
with conducting "technical assessments of the socio-economics of
impacts, adaptation and mitigation of climate change over both
the short and long term and at the regional and global levels".
Working Group III responded to this charge by further stipulating
in its work plan that it would place the socio-economic
perspectives in the context of sustainable development and, in
accordance with the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC), provide comprehensive treatment of both
mitigation and adaptation options while covering all economic
sectors and all relevant sources of greenhouse gases and sinks.

Still, a number of insights that may be useful to policymakers can be
drawn from the literature:
* Analyses indicate that a prudent way to deal with climate change is
through a portfolio of actions aimed at mitigation, adaptation and
improvement of knowledge. The appropriate portfolio will differ for
each country. The challenge is not to find the best policy today for
the next 100 years, but to select a prudent strategy and to adjust it
over time in the light of new information.
* Earlier mitigation action may increase flexibility in moving toward
stabilization of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases
(UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Article 2). The
choice of abatement paths involves balancing the economic risks
of rapid abatement now (that premature capital stock retirement
will later be proved unnecessary) against the corresponding risk of
delay (that more rapid reduction will then be required, necessitating premature retirement of future capital stock).
* The literature indicates that significant "no-regrets"2 opportunities
are available in most countries and that the risk of aggregate net
damage due to climate change, consideration of risk aversion, and
application of the precautionary principle provide rationales for
action beyond no regrets.
* The value of better information about climate change processes
and impacts and society's responses to them is likely to be great. In
particular, the literature accords high value to information about
climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases and aerosols, climate
change damage functions, and variables such as determinants of
economic growth and rates of energy efficiency improvements.
Better information about the costs and benefits of mitigation and

This report assesses a large part of the existing literature on the socioeconomics of climate change and identifies areas in which a
consensus has emerged on key issues and areas where differences
exist1. The chapters have been arranged so that they cover several key
issues. First, frameworks for socio-economic assessment of costs and
benefits of action and inaction are described. Particular attention is
given to the applicability of cost-benefit analysis, the incorporation
of equity and social considerations, and consideration of intergenerational equity issues. Second, the economic and social benefits of
limiting greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing sinks are reviewed.
Third, the economic, social and environmental costs of mitigating
greenhouse gas emissions are assessed. Next, generic mitigation and
adaptation response options are reviewed, methods for assessing the
costs and effectiveness of different response options are summarized,
and integrated assessment techniques are discussed. Finally, the
report provides an economic assessment of policy instruments to
combat climate change.
In accordance with the approved work plan, this assessment of the
socio-economic literature related to climate change focuses on
economic studies; material from other social sciences is found mostly
in the chapter on equity and social considerations. The report is an
assessment of the state of knowledge -- what we know and do not
know -- and not a prescription for policy implementation. Countries
can use the information in this report to help take decisions they
believe are most appropriate for their specific circumstances.

1 The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change defines "climate
change" as a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to
human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and
which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable
time periods. The question as to whether such changes are potential or can
already be identified is analyzed in the volume on the science of climate
change of the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR).

SCOPE OF THE ASSESSMENT

2 "No regrets" measures are those whose benefits, such as reduced energy
costs and reduced emissions of local/regional pollutants equal or exceed their
cost to society, excluding the benefits of climate change mitigation. They are
sometimes known as "measures worth doing anyway".

Climate change presents the decision maker with a set of formidable
complications: a considerable number of remaining uncertainties
(which are inherent in the complexity of the problem), the
45

CLIMATE CHANGE 1995: IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT
concentration, the emissions path toward this level, the discount
rate, and assumptions concerning the costs and availability of
technologies and practices.
* Despite its widespread use in economic policy evaluation, Gross
Domestic Product is widely recognized to be an imperfect measure
of society's well-being, largely because it fails to account for
degradation of the environment and natural systems. Other
methodologies exist that try to take these nonmarket values and
social and ecological sustainability into account. Such
methodologies would provide a more complete indication of how
climate change might affect society's well-being.
* Given the interrelated nature of the global economic system,
attempts to mitigate climate change through actions in one region
or sector may have offsetting economic effects that risk increasing
the emissions of other regions and sectors (so-called leakages).
These emission leakages can be lessened through coordinated
actions of groups of countries.
* The literature suggests that flexible, cost-effective policies relying on
economic incentives and instruments, as well as coordinated instruments, can considerably reduce mitigation or adaptation costs or
increase the cost-effectiveness of emission reduction measures.

adaptation measures and how they might change in coming
decades also has a high value.
* Analysis of economic and social issues related to climate change,
especially in developing countries where little work of this nature
has been carried out, is a high priority for research. More generally,
research is needed on integrated assessment and analysis of decision-making related to climate change. Further, research advancing
the economic understanding of non-linearities and new theories of
economic growth is also needed. Research and development related
to energy efficiency technologies and non-fossil energy options also
offer high potential value. In addition, there is also a need for
research on the development of sustainable consumption patterns.
A portfolio of possible actions that policymakers could consider, in
accordance with applicable international agreements, to implement
low-cost and/or cost-effective measures to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change can include:
* Implementing energy efficiency measures, including the removal of
institutional barriers to energy efficiency improvements;
* Phasing out existing distortionary policies and practices that increase
greenhouse gas emissions, such as some subsidies and regulations,
non-internalization of environmental costs and distortions in transport pricing;
* Implementing cost-effective fuel switching measures from more to
less carbon-intensive fuels and to carbon-free fuels such as renewables;
* Implementing measures to enhance sinks or reservoirs of greenhouse
gases, such as improving forest management and land use practices;
* Implementing measures and developing new techniques for reducing
methane, nitrous oxide and other greenhouse gas emissions;
* Encouraging forms of international cooperation to limit greenhouse
gas emissions, such as implementing coordinated carbon/energy
taxes, activities implemented jointly and tradable quotas;
* Promoting the development and implementation of national and
international energy efficiency standards;
* Promoting voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;
* Promoting education and training, implementing information and
advisory measures for sustainable development and consumption
patterns that will facilitate climate change mitigation and adaptation;
* Planning and implementing measures to adapt to the consequences
of climate change;
* Undertaking research aimed at better understanding of the causes and
impacts of climate change and facilitating more effective adaptation
to it;
* Conducting technological research aimed at minimizing emissions of
greenhouse gases from continued use of fossil fuels and developing
commercial non-fossil energy sources;
* Developing improved institutional mechanisms, such as improved
insurance arrangements, to share the risks of damages due to climate
change.

Equity considerations
In considering equity principles and issues related to greenhouse gas
emissions, it is important for policy consideration to take into
account in particular Articles 3, 4.2a and 11.2 of the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change, Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration
and general principles of international law.
Scientific analyses cannot prescribe how equity should be applied in
implementing the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change,
but analysis can clarify the implications of alternative choices and
their ethical basis.
* Developing countries require support for institutional and endogenous capacity building, so that they may effectively participate
in climate change decision-making.
* It is important that both efficiency and equity concerns be
considered during the analysis of mitigation and adaptation
measures. For the purposes of analysis, it is possible to separate
efficiency from equity. This analytical separation pre-supposes that
(and is valid, for policy purposes, only if) effective institutions exist
or can be created for appropriate redistribution of climate change
costs. It may be worthwhile to conduct analyses of the equity
implications of particular measures for achieving efficiency,
including their social considerations and impacts.

DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORKS FOR
ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE

Since climate change is a global issue, comprehensive analyses of mitigation, adaptation and research measures are needed to identify the
most efficient and appropriate strategy to address climate change.
International decision-making related to climate change, as established

* Estimates of the costs and benefits of stabilizing greenhouse gas
concentrations are sensitive, inter alia, to the ultimate target

SUMMARY FOR POLICYMAKERS: THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
by the UNFCCC, is a collective process in which a variety of concerns
such as equity, ecological protection, economics, ethics and povertyrelated issues, are of special significance for present and future
generations. Treatments of decision-making under uncertainty, risk
aversion, technology development and diffusion processes, and distributional considerations are at present relatively poorly developed in
international environmental economics, and especially in the climate
change literature.

Application of the literature on decision-making to climate change
provides elements that can be used in building collective and/or
market-oriented strategies for sharing risks and realizing mutual
benefits. It suggests that actions be sequential (temporally
distributed), that countries implement a portfolio of mitigation,
adaptation and research measures, and that they adjust this
portfolio continuously in response to new knowledge. The potential
for transfers of financial resources and technology to developing
countries may be considered as a part of any comprehensive
analytical framework.

Decision-making related to climate change must take into account
the unique characteristics of the "problem": large uncertainties
(scientific and economic), possible non-linearities and irreversibilities, asymmetric distribution of impacts geographically and
temporally, the very long time horizon, and the global nature of
climate change with the associated potential for free riding. Beyond
scientific uncertainties (discussed in the volume on the science of
climate change of the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR)) and
impact uncertainties (the volume on the scientific-technical analyses
of impacts, adaptations and mitigation of climate change of the IPCC
Second Assessment Report (SAR)), socio-economic uncertainties relate to
estimates of how these changes will affect human society (including
direct economic and broader welfare impacts) and to the socioeconomic implications of emission abatement.

Elements of a market-related strategy concern insurance and markets
for risk. Pooling risk does not change the risk, but it can improve
economic efficiency and welfare. Although insurance capable of
sharing climate change risks on a global basis currently does not
exist, one of the important potential gains from cooperating in a
collective framework, such as the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change, is that of risk sharing. Creating an insurance system
to cover the risks of climate change is difficult3 and the international
community has not yet established such sophisticated instruments.
This, however, does not preclude future international action to establish insurance markets sufficient for some international needs.

4.

The other dimension that magnifies uncertainties and complicates
decision-making is geographical: climate change is a global problem
encompassing an incredibly diverse mix of human societies, with
differing histories, circumstances and capabilities. Many developing
countries are in relatively hot climates, depend more heavily on
agriculture, and have less well developed infrastructure and social
structures; thus, they may suffer more than average, perhaps much
more. In developed countries, there may also be large climate
change impacts.

Equity considerations are an important aspect of climate change
policy and of the Convention. In common language equity means
"the quality of being impartial" or "something that is fair and just".
The UNFCCC, including the references to equity and equitable in
Articles 3.1, 4.2.a and 11.2, provides the context for efforts to apply
equity in meeting the purposes and the objective of the
Convention. International law, including relevant decisions of the
International Court of Justice, may also provide guidance.

The literature also emphasizes that delaying responses is itself a
decision involving costs. Some studies suggest that the cost of delay
is small; others emphasize that the costs could include imposition
of risks on all parties (particularly the most vulnerable), greater
utilization of limited atmospheric capacity and potential deferral of
desirable technical development. No consensus is reflected in the
literature.
The global nature of the problem -- necessitating collective action
by sovereign states -- and the large differences in the circumstances
of different parties raise consequential as well as procedural issues.
Consequential issues relate to outcomes while procedural issues
relate to how decisions are made. In relation to climate change, the
existence of an agreed legal framework involves a collective process
within a negotiated framework (the UNFCCC). Accordingly,
decision-making can be considered within three different categories
of frameworks, each with different implications and with distinct
foci: global optimization (trying to find the globally optimal result),
procedural decision-making (establishing and refining rules of
procedure) and collective decision-making (dealing with
distributional issues and processes involving the interaction of
numerous independent decision makers).

EQUITY AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

A variety of ethical principles, including the importance of meeting
people's basic needs, may be relevant to addressing climate change,
but the application to relations among states of principles originally
developed to guide individual behaviour is complex and not
straightforward. Climate change policies should not aggravate existing disparities between one region and another nor attempt to
redress all equity issues.
Equity involves procedural as well as consequential issues.
Procedural issues relate to how decisions are made while consequential issues relate to outcomes. To be effective and to promote
cooperation, agreements must be regarded as legitimate, and equity
is an important element in gaining legitimacy.
Procedural equity encompasses process and participation issues. It
requires that all parties be able to participate effectively in international negotiations related to climate change. Appropriate measures

3 Without knowing the extent of potential impacts, the ability of private
markets to insure against losses associated with climate change is unknown.

47

CLIMATE CHANGE 1995: IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT
to enable developing country parties to participate effectively in
negotiations increase the prospects for achieving effective, lasting
and equitable agreements on how best to address the threat of
climate change. Concern about equity and social impacts points to
the need to build endogenous capabilities and strengthen institutional capacities, particularly in developing countries, to make and
implement collective decisions in a legitimate and equitable
manner.

It is important that both efficiency and equity concerns should be
considered during the analysis of mitigation and adaptation
measures. It may be worthwhile to conduct analyses of the equity
implications of particular measures for achieving efficiency, including their social considerations and impacts.

5.

Consequential equity has two components: the distribution of the
costs of damages or adaptation and of measures to mitigate climate
change. Because countries differ substantially in vulnerability,
wealth, capacity, resource endowments and other factors listed
below, the costs of the damages, adaptation and mitigation may be
borne inequitably, unless the distribution of these costs is addressed
explicitly.

INTERTEMPORAL EQUITY AND
DISCOUNTING

Climate policy, like many other policy issues, raises particular questions of equity among generations, because future generations are
not able to influence directly the policies being chosen today that
could affect their well-being and because it might not be possible to
compensate future generations for consequent reductions in their
well-being.
Sustainable development is one approach to intergenerational equity.
Sustainable development meets "the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs".4 A consensus exists among economists that this does not imply
that future generations should inherit a world with at least as much of
every resource. Nevertheless, sustainable development would require
that use of exhaustible natural resources and environmental degradation are appropriately offset -- for example, by an increase in
productive assets sufficient to enable future generations to obtain at
least the same standard of living as those alive today. There are different views in the literature on the extent to which infrastructure and
knowledge, on the one hand, and natural resources, such as a healthy
environment, on the other hand, are substitutes. This is crucial to
applying these concepts. Some analysts stress that there are exhaustible
resources that are unique and cannot be substituted for. Others believe
that current generations can compensate future generations for
decreases in the quality or quantity of environmental resources by
increases in other resources.

Climate change is likely to impose costs on future generations and on
regions where damages occur, including regions with low greenhouse
gas emissions. Climate change impacts will be distributed unevenly.
The Convention recognizes in Article 3.1 the principle of common
but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.
Actions beyond "no-regrets" measures impose costs on the present
generation. Mitigation policies unavoidably raise issues about how
to share the costs. The initial emission limitation intentions of
Annex I parties represent an agreed collective first step of those
parties in addressing climate change.
Equity arguments can support a variety of proposals to distribute
mitigation costs. Most of them seem to cluster around two main
approaches: equal per capita emission allocations and allocations
based on incremental departures from national baseline emissions
(current or projected). Some proposals combine these approaches in
an effort to incorporate equity concerns not addressed by relying
exclusively on one or the other approach. The IPCC can clarify
scientifically the implications of different approaches and proposals, but the choice of particular proposals is a policy judgment.

Discounting is the principal analytical tool economists use to compare
economic effects that occur at different points in time. The choice of
discount rate is of crucial technical importance for analyses of climate
change policy, because the time horizon is extremely long, and mitigation costs tend to come much earlier than the benefits of avoided
damages. The higher the discount rate, the less future benefits and the
more current costs matter in the analysis.

There are substantial variations both among developed and
developing countries that are relevant to the application of equity
principles to mitigation. These include variations in historical and
cumulative emissions, current total and per capita emissions,
emission intensities and economic output, and factors such as
wealth, energy structures and resource endowments. The literature
is weak on the equity implications of these variations both among
developed and developing countries.

Selection of a social discount rate is also a question of values since
it inherently relates the costs of present measures, to possible
damages suffered by future generations if no action is taken.5 How
best to choose a discount rate is, and will likely remain, an unresolved question in economics. Partly as a consequence, different

In addition, the implications of climate change for developing countries are different from those for developed countries. The former often
have different urgent priorities, weaker institutions, and are generally
more vulnerable to climate change. However, it is likely that developing countries' share of emissions will grow further to meet their social
and developmental needs. Greenhouse gas emissions are likely to
become increasingly global, even whilst substantial per capita disparities are likely to remain.

4 A related (somewhat stronger) concept is that each generation is entitled to
inherit a planet and cultural resource base at least as good as that of previous
generations.
5 A social discount rate is a discount rate appropriate for use by governments
in the evaluation of public policy.

48

SUMMARY FOR POLICYMAKERS: THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
discount rates are used in different countries. Analysts typically
conduct sensitivity studies using various discount rates. It should
also be recognized that the social discount rate pre-supposes that all
effects are transformed to their equivalent in consumption. This
makes it difficult to apply to those nonmarket impacts of climate
change which for ethical reasons might not be, or for practical
reasons cannot be, converted into consumption units.

cost option to achieve an objective specified using other criteria.
Multicriteria analysis is designed to deal with problems where some
benefits and/or costs are measured in nonmonetary units. Decision
analysis focuses specifically on making decisions under uncertainty.
In principle, this group of techniques can contribute to improving
public policy decisions concerning the desirable extent of actions to
mitigate global climate change, the timing of such actions and the
methods to be employed.

The literature on the appropriate social discount rate for climate
change analysis can be grouped into two broad categories. One
approach discounts consumption by different generations using the
"social rate of time preference," which is the sum of the rate of
"pure time preference" (impatience) and the rate of increase of
welfare derived from higher per capita incomes in the future.
Depending upon the values taken for the different parameters, the
discount rate tends to fall between 0.5% and 3.0% per year on a
global basis -- using this approach. However, wide variations in
regional discount rates exist, but these may still be consistent with
a particular global average.

Traditional cost-benefit analysis is based on the concept that the
level of emission control at each point in time is determined such
that marginal costs equal marginal benefits. However, both costs
and benefits may be hard, sometimes impossible, to assess. This may
be due to large uncertainties, possible catastrophes with very small
probabilities, or simply because there is no available consistent
methodology for monetizing the effects. In some of these cases, it
may be possible to apply multicriteria analysis. This provides policymakers with a broader set of information, including evaluation of
relevant costs and benefits, estimated within a common framework.

The second approach to the discount rate considers market returns to
investment, which range between 3% and 6% in real terms for longterm, risk-free public investments. Conceptually, funds could be
invested in projects that earn such returns, with the proceeds being
used to increase the consumption for future generations.

Practical application of traditional cost-benefit analysis to the problem
of climate change is therefore difficult because of the global, regional
and intergenerational nature of the problem. Estimates of the costs of
mitigation options also vary widely. Furthermore, estimates of potential physical damages due to climate change also vary widely. In
addition, confidence in monetary estimates for important consequences (especially nonmarket consequences) is low. These
uncertainties, and the resolution of uncertainty over time, may be decisive for the choice of strategies to combat climate change. The objective
of decision analysis is to deal with such problems. Furthermore, for
some categories of ecological, cultural and human health impacts,
widely accepted economic concepts of value are not available. To the
extent that some impacts and measures cannot be valued in monetary
terms, economists augment the traditional cost-benefit analysis
approach with such techniques as multicriteria analysis, permitting
some quantitative expression of the trade-offs to be made. These techniques do not resolve questions involving equity -- for example,
determining who should bear the costs. However, they provide important information on the incidence of damage, mitigation, and
adaptation costs and on where cost-effective action might be taken.

The choice of the social discount rate for public investment projects
is a matter of policy preference but has a major impact on the
economic evaluation of climate change actions.6 For example, in
today's dollars, $1,000 of damage 100 years from now would be
valued at $370 using a 1% discount rate (near the low end of the
range for the first approach) but would be valued at $7.60 using a
5% discount rate (near the upper end of the range for the second
approach). However, in cost-effectiveness analyses of policies over
short time horizons, the impact of using different discount rates is
much smaller. In all areas analysts should specify the discount
rate(s) they use to facilitate comparison and aggregation of results.

6.

APPLICABILITY OF COST AND
BENEFIT ASSESSMENTS

Many factors need to be taken into account in the evaluation of
projects and public policy issues related to climate change, including the analysis of possible costs and benefits. Although costs and
benefits cannot all be measured in monetary terms, various techniques exist which offer a useful framework for organizing
information about the consequences of alternative actions for
addressing climate change.

Despite their many imperfections, these techniques provide a valuable
framework for identifying essential questions that policymakers must
face when dealing with climate change, namely:
* By how much should emissions of greenhouse gases be reduced?
* When should emissions be reduced?
* How should emissions be reduced?
These analytical techniques assist decision makers in comparing the
consequences of alternative actions, including that of no action, on
a quantitative basis -- and can certainly make a contribution to
resolution of these questions.

The family of analytical techniques for examining economic environmental policies and decisions includes traditional project level
cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, multicriteria analysis and decision analysis. Traditional cost-benefit analysis attempts
to compare all costs and benefits expressed in terms of a common
monetary unit. Cost-effectiveness analysis seeks to find the lowest-

6 Despite the differences in the value of the discount rate, policies developed
on the basis of the two approaches may lead to similar results.

THE SOCIAL COSTS OF ANTHROPOGENIC
CLIMATE CHANGE: DAMAGES OF
INCREASED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

obtain total social welfare impacts implies difficult decisions about
equity amongst countries. Global estimates are based upon an
aggregation of monetary damages across countries (damages
which are themselves implicit aggregations across individuals) that
reflects intercountry differences in wealth and income -- this
fundamentally influences the monetary valuation of damages.
Taking income differences as given implies that an equivalent
impact in two countries (such as an equal increase in human
mortality) would receive very different weights in the calculations
of global damages.

The literature on the subject in this section is controversial and
mainly based on research done on developed countries, often
extrapolated to developing countries. There is no consensus about
how to value statistical lives or how to aggregate statistical lives
across countries.7 Monetary valuation should not obscure the
human consequences of anthropogenic climate change damages,
because the value of life has meaning beyond monetary valuation.
It should be noted that the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 call for
human beings to remain at the centre of sustainable development.
The approach taken to this valuation might affect the scale of
damage reduction strategies. It may be noted that, in virtually all of
the literature discussed in this section, the developing country
statistical lives have not been equally valued at the developed
country value, nor are other damages in developing countries
equally valued at the developed country value. Because national
circumstances, including opportunity costs, differ, economists
sometimes evaluate certain kinds of impacts differently amongst
countries.

To enable choices between different ways of promoting human
welfare to be made on a consistent basis, economists have for many
years sought to express a wide range of human and environmental
impacts in terms of monetary equivalents, using various techniques.
The most commonly used of those techniques is an approach based
on the observed willingness to pay for various nonmarket benefits.8
This is the approach that has been taken in most of the assessed
literature.
Human life is an element outside the market and societies may want
to preserve it in an equal way. An approach that includes equal
valuation of impacts on human life wherever they occur may yield
different global aggregate estimates than those reported below. For
example, equalizing the value of a statistical life at a global average
could leave total global damage unchanged but would increase
markedly the share of these damages borne by the developing
world. Equalizing the value at the level typical in developed countries would increase monetized damages several times, and would
further increase the share of the developing countries in the total
damage estimate.

The benefits of limiting greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing
sinks are: (a) the climate change damages avoided; and (b) the
secondary benefits associated with the relevant policies. Secondary
benefits include reductions in other pollutants jointly produced
with greenhouse gases and the conservation of biological diversity.
Net climate change damages include both market and nonmarket
impacts as far as they can be quantified at present and, in some
cases, adaptation costs. Damages are expressed in net terms to
account for the fact that there are some beneficial impacts of global
warming as well, which are, however, dominated by the damage
costs. Nonmarket impacts, such as human health, risk of human
mortality and damage to ecosystems, form an important
component of available estimates of the social costs of climate
change. The literature on monetary valuation of such nonmarket
effects reflects a number of divergent views and approaches. The
estimates of nonmarket damages, however, are highly speculative
and not comprehensive.

Other aggregation methods can be used to adjust for differences in
the wealth or incomes of countries in calculations of monetary
damages. Because estimates of monetary damage tend to be a higher
percentage of national GDP for low-income countries than for highincome countries, aggregation schemes that adjust for wealth or
income effects are expected to yield higher estimates of global
damages than those presented in this report.
The assessed literature quantifying total damages from 2-3C warming
provides a wide range of point estimates for damages, given the
presumed change in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The
aggregate estimates tend to be a few per cent of world GDP, with, in
general, considerably higher estimates of damage to developing countries as a share of their GDP. The aggregate estimates are subject to
considerable uncertainty, but the range of uncertainty cannot be

Nonmarket damage estimates are a source of major uncertainty in
assessing the implications of global climate change for human
welfare. While some regard monetary valuation of such impacts as
essential to sound decision-making, others reject monetary valuation of some impacts, such as risk of human mortality, on ethical
grounds. Additionally, there is a danger that entire unique cultures
may be obliterated. This is not something that can be considered in
monetary terms, but becomes a question of loss of human diversity,
for which we have no indicators to measure economic value.

7 The value of a statistical life is defined as the value people assign to a
change in the risk of death among the population.

The assessed literature contains only a few estimates of the
monetized damages associated with doubled CO2 equivalent
concentration scenarios. These estimates are aggregated to a global
scale and illustrate the potential impacts of climate change under
selected scenarios. Aggregating individual monetized damages to

8 The concept of willingness to pay is indicative, based on expressed desires,
available resources and information of a human being's preferences at a
certain moment in time. The values may change over time. Also, other
concepts (such as willingness to accept compensation for damage) have been
advanced, but not yet widely applied, in the literature, and the interpretation
and application of willingness to pay and other concepts to the climate
problem may evolve.

50

SUMMARY FOR POLICYMAKERS: THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
gauged from the literature. The range of estimates cannot be interpreted as a confidence interval, given the widely differing assumptions
and methodologies in the studies. As noted above, aggregation is likely
to mask even greater uncertainties about damage components.

* A large potential for cost-effective energy conservation and efficiency improvements in energy supply and energy use exists in
many sectors. These options offer economic and environmental benefits in addition to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Various of
these options can be deployed rapidly due to small unit size, modular design characteristics and low lifetime costs.
The options for CO2 mitigation in energy use include alternative
methods and efficiency improvements, among others in the
construction, residential, commercial, agriculture and industry
sectors. Not all cost-effective strategies are based on new technology; some may rely on improved information dissemination and
public education, managerial strategies, pricing policies and institutional reforms.
* Estimates of the technical potential for switching to less carbonintensive fuels vary regionally and with the type of measure and
the economic availability of reserves of fossil and alternative fuels.
These estimates also have to take account of potential methane
emissions from leakage of natural gas during production and
distribution.
* Renewable energy technologies (e.g., solar, hydroelectric, wind,
traditional and modern biomass, and ocean thermal energy
conversion) have achieved different levels of technical development, economic maturity and commercial readiness. The potential
of these energy sources is not fully realized. Cost estimates for these
technologies are sensitive to site-specific characteristics, resource
variability and the form of final energy delivered. These cost estimates vary widely.
* Nuclear energy11 is a technology that has been deployed for
several decades in many countries. However, a number of factors
have slowed the expansion of nuclear power, including: (a) wary
public perceptions resulting from nuclear accidents, (b) not yet
fully resolved issues concerning reactor safety, proliferation of
fissile material, power-plant decommissioning and long-term
disposal of nuclear waste, as well as, in some instances, lower-thananticipated levels of demand for electricity. Regulatory and siting
difficulties have increased construction lead times, leading to
higher capital costs for this option in some countries. If these
issues, including inter alia the social, political and environmental
aspects mentioned above, can be resolved, nuclear energy has the
potential to increase its present share in worldwide energy
production.
* CO2 capture and disposal may be ultimately limited for technical
and environmental reasons, because not all forms of disposal ensure
prevention of carbon re-entering the atmosphere.

Regional or sectoral approaches to estimating the consequences of
climate change include a much wider range of estimates of the net
economic effects. For some areas, damages are estimated to be significantly greater and could negatively affect economic development.
For others, climate change is estimated to increase economic production and present opportunities for economic development. For
countries generally having a diversified, industrial economy and an
educated and flexible labour force, the limited set of published estimates of damages are of the order one to a few per cent of GDP. For
countries generally having a specialized and natural resource-based
economy (e.g., heavily emphasizing agriculture or forestry), and a
poorly developed and land-tied labour force, estimates of damages
from the few studies available are several times larger. Small islands
and low-lying coastal areas are particularly vulnerable. Damages from
possible large-scale catastrophes, such as major changes in ocean
circulation, are not reflected in these estimates. There is little agreement across studies about the exact magnitude of each category of
damages or relative ranking of the damage categories.9 Climate
changes of this magnitude are not expected to be realized for several
decades, and damages in the interim could be smaller. Damages over
a longer period of time might be greater.10
IPCC does not endorse any particular range of values for the
marginal damage of CO2 emissions, but published estimates range
between $5 and $125 (1990 U.S.) per tonne of carbon emitted now.
This range of estimates does not represent the full range of
uncertainty. The estimates are also based on models that remain
simplistic and are limited representations of the actual climate
processes in being and are based on earlier IPCC scientific reports.
The wide range of damage estimates reflects variations in model
scenarios, discount rates and other assumptions. It must be
emphasized that the social cost estimates have a wide range of
uncertainty because of limited knowledge of impacts, uncertain
future technological and socio-economic developments, and the
possibility of catastrophic events or surprises.

GENERIC ASSESSMENT OF
RESPONSE STRATEGIES

A wide range of technologies and practices is available for
mitigating emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and
other greenhouse gases. There are also many adaptation measures
available for responding to the impacts of climate change. All these
technologies, practices and measures have financial and
environmental costs as well as benefits. This section surveys the
range of options currently available or discussed in the literature.
The optimal mix of response options will vary by country and over
time as local conditions and costs change.

9 Due to time lags between findings in the natural sciences, their use in determination of potential physical and biological impacts, and subsequent
incorporation into economic analyses of climate change, the estimates of
climate change damage are based mainly on the scientific results from the
1990 and 1992 IPCC reports.
10 See the volume on the science of climate change and the volume on the
scientific-technical analyses of impacts, adaptations and mitigation of
climate change of the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR).
11 For more information on the technical aspects of nuclear power, see the
volume on the scientific-technical analyses of impacts, adaptations and mitigation of climate change of the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR).

A review of CO2 mitigation options suggests that:
51

CLIMATE CHANGE 1995: IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT
* Forestry options, in some circumstances, offer large potential,
modest costs, low risk and other benefits. Further, the potential
modern use of biomass as a source of fuels and electricity could
become attractive. Halting or slowing deforestation and increasing
reforestation through increased silvicultural productivity and
sustainable management programmes that increase agricultural
productivity, the expansion of forest reserves and promotion of
ecotourism are among the cost-effective options for slowing the
atmospheric build-up of CO2. Forestry programmes raise important equity considerations.12

The optimal response strategy for each country will depend on the
special circumstances and conditions which that country must face.
Nonetheless, many recent studies and empirical observations
suggest that some of the most cost-effective options can be most
successfully implemented on a joint or cooperative basis among
nations.

9.

COSTS OF RESPONSE OPTIONS

It must be emphasized that the text in this section is an assessment
of the technical literature and does not make recommendations on
policy matters. The available literature is primarily from developed
countries.

There is also a wide range of available technologies and practices for
reducing emissions of methane from such sources as natural gas
systems, coal mines, waste dumps and farms. However, the issue of
reduction of emissions related to food supply may imply trade-offs
with rates of food production. These trade-offs must be carefully
assessed, as they may affect the provision of basic needs in some
countries, particularly in developing countries.

Cost concepts
From the perspective of this section on assessing mitigation or adaptation costs, what matters is the net cost (total cost less secondary
benefits and costs). These net costs exclude the social costs of climate
change, which are discussed in Section 7 above. The assessed literature yields a very wide range of estimates of the costs of response
options. The wide range largely reflects significant differences in
assumptions about the efficiency of energy and other markets, and
about the ability of government institutions to address perceived
market failures or imperfections.

Most nitrous oxide emissions come from diffuse sources related to
agriculture and forestry. These emissions are difficult to reduce
rapidly. Industrial emissions of nitrous oxide and halogenated
compounds tend to be concentrated in a few key sectors and tend
to be easier to control. Measures to limit such emissions may be
attractive for many countries.
The slow implementation of many of the technologically attractive
and cost-effective options listed above has many possible explanations, with both actual and perceived costs being a major factor.
Among other factors, capital availability, information gaps, institutional obstacles and market imperfections affect the rate of diffusion
for these technologies. Identifying the reasons specific to a particular
country is a precondition to devising sound and efficient policies to
encourage their broader adoption.

Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may yield additional
economic impacts (for example, through technological externalities
associated with fostering research and development programmes)
and/or environmental impacts (such as reduced emissions of acid
rain and urban smog precursors). Studies suggest that the secondary
environmental benefits may be substantial but are likely to differ
from country to country.

Education and training as well as information and advisory
measures are important aspects of various response options.

Specific results
Many of the emission-reducing technologies and practices described
above also provide other benefits to society. These additional benefits include improved air quality, better protection of surface and
underground waters, enhanced animal productivity, reduced risk of
explosions and fire, and improved use of energy resources.

Estimates of the cost of greenhouse gas emission reduction depend
critically upon assumptions about the levels of energy efficiency
improvements in the baseline scenario (that is, in the absence of
climate policy) and upon a wide range of factors such as consumption patterns, resource and technology availability, the desired level
and timing of abatement, and the choice of policy instruments.
Policymakers should not place too much confidence in the specific
numerical results from any one analysis. For example, mitigation
cost analyses reveal the costs of mitigation relative to a given baseline, but neither the baseline nor the intervention scenarios should
be interpreted as representing likely future conditions. The focus
should be on the general insights regarding the underlying determinants of costs.

Many options are also available for adapting to the impacts of climate
change and thus reducing the damages to national economies and
natural ecosystems. Adaptive options are available in many sectors,
ranging from agriculture and energy to health, coastal zone management, offshore fisheries and recreation. Some of these provide
enhanced ability to cope with the current impacts of climate variability. However, possible trade-offs between implementation of
mitigation and adaptation measures are important to consider in
future research. A summary of sectoral options for adaptation is
presented in the volume on the scientific-technical analyses of
impacts, adaptations and mitigation of climate change of the IPCC
Second Assessment Report (SAR).

12 These are addressed in Section 4 above and in the volume on economic
and social dimensions of climate change of the IPCC Second Assessment
Report (SAR).

SUMMARY FOR POLICYMAKERS: THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
The costs of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases at levels and within a time-frame that will prevent dangerous
anthropogenic interference with the climate system (the ultimate
objective of the UNFCCC) will be critically dependent on the choice
of emission timepath. The cost of the abatement programme will be
influenced by the rate of capital replacement, the discount rate, and
the effect of research and development.

Infrastructure decisions are critical in determining long-term emissions and abatement costs because they can enhance or restrict the
number and type of future options. Infrastructure decisions determine development patterns in transportation, urban settlement and
land-use, and influence energy system development and deforestation patterns. This issue is of particular importance to developing
countries and many economies in transition where major infrastructure decisions will be made in the near term.

Failure to adopt policies as early as possible to encourage efficient
replacement investments at the end of the economic life of a plant
and equipment (i.e., at the point of capital stock turnover) imposes
an economic cost to society. Implementing emission reductions at
rates that can be absorbed in the course of normal stock turnover is
likely to be cheaper than enforcing premature retirement now.

If a carbon or carbon-energy tax is used as a policy instrument for
reducing emissions, the taxes could raise substantial revenues, and
how the revenues are distributed could dramatically affect the cost
of mitigation. If the revenues are distributed by reducing
distortionary taxes in the existing system, they will help reduce the
excess burden of the existing tax system, potentially yielding an
additional economic benefit (double dividend). For example, those
European studies which are more optimistic regarding the potential
for tax recycling show lower and, in some instances, slightly
negative costs. Conversely, inefficient recycling of the tax revenues
could increase costs. For example, if the tax revenues are used to
finance government programmes that yield a lower return than the
private sector investments foregone because of the tax, then overall
costs will increase.

The choice of abatement paths thus involves balancing the economic
risks of rapid abatement now (that premature capital stock retirement
will later be proved unnecessary) against the corresponding risk of
delay (that more rapid reduction will then be required, necessitating
premature retirement of future capital stock).
Appropriate long-run signals are required to allow producers and
consumers to adapt cost-effectively to constraints on greenhouse
gas emissions and to encourage research and development. Benefits
associated with the implementation of any "no-regret" policies will
offset, at least in part, the costs of a full portfolio of mitigation
measures. This will also increase the time available to learn about
climate risks and to bring new technologies into the marketplace.

There are large differences in the costs of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions among countries because of their state of economic development, infrastructure choices and natural resource base. This
indicates that international cooperation could significantly reduce
the global cost of reducing emissions. Research suggests that, in
principle, substantial savings would be possible if emissions are
reduced where it is cheapest to do so. In practice, this requires international mechanisms ensuring appropriate capital flows and
technology transfers between countries. Conversely, a failure to
achieve international cooperation could compromise unilateral
attempts by a country or a group of countries to limit greenhouse
gas emissions. However, estimates of so called leakage effects vary so
widely that they provide little guidance to policymakers.

Despite significant differences in views, there is agreement that
energy efficiency gains of perhaps 10-30% above baseline trends
over the next two to three decades can be realized at negative to
zero net cost. (Negative net cost means an economic benefit.) With
longer time horizons, which allow a more complete turnover of
capital stocks, and which give research and development and
market transformation policies a chance to impact multiple replacement cycles, this potential is much higher. The magnitude of such
"no-regret" potentials depends upon the existence of substantial
market or institutional imperfections that prevent cost-effective
emission reduction measures from occurring. The key question is
then the extent to which such imperfections and barriers can be
removed cost-effectively by policy initiatives such as efficiency
standards, incentives, removal of subsidies, information
programmes and funding of technology transfer.

There has been more analysis to date of emission reduction potentials
and costs for developed countries than for other parts of the world.
Moreover, many existing models are not well-suited to study
economies in transition or economies of developing countries. Much
work is needed to develop and apply models for use outside developed countries (for example, to represent more explicitly market
imperfections, institutional barriers, and traditional and informal
economic sectors). In addition, the discussion below and the bulk of
the underlying report deal with costs of response options at the
national or regional level in terms of effect on GDP. Further analysis
is required concerning effects of response options on employment,
inflation, trade competitiveness and other public issues.

Progress has been made in a number of countries in cost-effectively
reducing imperfections and institutional barriers in markets
through policy instruments based on voluntary agreements, energy
efficiency incentives, product efficiency standards and energy
efficiency procurement programmes involving manufacturers, as
well as utility regulatory reforms. Where empirical evaluations have
been made, many have found the benefit-cost ratio of increasing
energy efficiency to be favourable, suggesting the practical
feasibility of realizing "no-regret" potentials at negative net cost.
More information is needed on similar and improved programmes
in a wider range of countries.

A large number of studies using both top-down and bottom-up
approaches (see Box 1 for definitions) were reviewed. Estimates of
the costs of limiting fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions (expressed
as carbon) vary widely and depend upon choice of methodologies,
underlying assumptions, emission scenarios, policy instruments,
53

CLIMATE CHANGE 1995: IPCC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT
logical progress, and earlier saturation in energy services per unit
GDP. In the most favourable assessments, savings of 10-20% in the
total cost of energy services can be achieved.

BOX 1. TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP MODELS
Top-down models are aggregate models of the entire macroeconomy that draw on analysis of historical trends and
relationships to predict the large-scale interactions between the
sectors of the economy, especially the interactions between the
energy sector and the rest of the economy. Top-down models
typically incorporate relatively little detail on energy consumption
and technological change, compared with bottom-up models.
In contrast, bottom-up models incorporate detailed studies of
the engineering costs of a wide range of available and forecast
technologies, and describe energy consumption in great detail.
However, compared with top-down models, they typically incorporate relatively little detail on nonenergy consumer behaviour
and interactions with other sectors of the economy.
This simple characterization of top-down and bottom-up
models is increasingly misleading as more recent versions of each
approach have tended to provide greater detail in the aspects
that were less developed in the past. As a result of this convergence in model structure, model results are tending to converge,
and the remaining differences reflect differences in assumptions
about how rapidly and effectively market institutions adopt costeffective new technologies or can be induced to adopt them by
policy interventions.
Many existing models are not well suited to study economies in
transition or those of developing countries. More work is needed
to develop the appropriate methodologies, data and models and
to build the local institutional capacity to undertake analyses.

Economies in transition. The potential for cost-effective reductions in energy use is apt to be considerable, but the realizable
potential will depend upon what economic and technological
development path is chosen, as well as the availability of capital to
pursue different paths. A critical issue is the future of structural
changes in these countries that are apt to change dramatically the
level of baseline emissions and the emission reduction costs.
Developing countries. Analyses suggest that there may be substantial low-cost fossil fuel carbon dioxide emission reduction
opportunities for developing countries. Development pathways that
increase energy efficiency, promote alternative energy technologies,
reduce deforestation, and enhance agricultural productivity and
biomass energy production can be economically beneficial. To
embark upon this pathway may require significant international
cooperation and financial and technology transfers. However, these
are likely to be insufficient to offset rapidly increasing emissions
baselines, associated with increased economic growth and overall
welfare. Stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions is likely to be
costly.
It should be noted that analyses of costs to economies in transition
and developing countries typically neglect the general equilibrium
effects of unilateral actions taken by developed countries. These
effects may be either positive or negative and their magnitude is
difficult to quantify.

reporting year and other criteria. For specific results of individual
studies, see the volume on economic and social dimenstions of
climate change of the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR).

It should also be noted that estimates of costs or benefits of the
order of a few per cent of GDP may represent small differences in
GDP growth rates, but are nevertheless substantial in absolute
terms.

OECD countries. Although it is difficult to generalize, top-down
analyses suggest that the costs of substantial reductions below 1990
levels could be as high as several per cent of GDP. In the specific
case of stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels, most studies estimate
that annual costs in the range of -0.5% of GDP (equivalent to a gain
of about $60 billion in total for OECD countries at today's GDP
levels) to 2% of GDP (equivalent to a loss of about $240 billion)
could be reached over the next several decades. However, studies
also show that appropriate timing of abatement measures and the
availability of low-cost alternatives may substantially reduce the
size of the overall bill.

Preservation and augmentation of carbon sinks offer a substantial
and often cost-effective component of a greenhouse gas mitigation
strategy. Studies suggest that as much as 15-30% of 1990 global
energy-related emissions could be offset by carbon sequestration in
forests for a period of 50-100 years. The costs of carbon sequestration, which are competitive with source control options, may
differ among regions of the world.
Control of emissions of other greenhouse gases, especially methane
and nitrous oxide, can provide significant cost-effective opportunities in some countries. About 10% of anthropogenic methane
emissions could be reduced at negative or low cost using available
mitigation options for such methane sources as natural gas systems,
waste management and agriculture.

Bottom-up studies are more optimistic about the potential for low
or negative cost emission reductions, and the capacity to implement that potential. Such studies show that the costs of reducing
emissions by 20% in developed countries within two to three
decades are negligible to negative. Other bottom-up studies suggest
that there exists a potential for absolute reductions in excess of 50%
in the longer term, without increasing, and perhaps even reducing,
total energy system costs.

INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT

Integrated assessment models combine knowledge from a wide
range of disciplines to provide insights that would not be

such factors as higher estimates of no-regrets potential and techno54

SUMMARY FOR POLICYMAKERS: THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
observed through traditional disciplinary research. They are used
to explore possible states of human and natural systems, analyze
key questions related to policy formulation and help set research
priorities. Integration helps coordinate assumptions from different
disciplines and allows feedbacks and interactions absent from
individual disciplines to be analyzed. However, the results of such
analyses are no better than the information drawn from the
underlying economic, atmospheric and biological sciences.
Integrated assessment models are limited both by the underlying
knowledge base upon which they draw and by the relatively
limited experiential base.

gas emissions. A further concern of governments may lie with the effect
of policies on competitiveness.
The world economy and indeed some individual national
economies suffer from a number of price distortions which increase
greenhouse gas emissions, such as some agricultural and fuel subsidies and distortions in transport pricing. A number of studies of
this issue indicate that global emission reductions of 4-18%,
together with increases in real incomes, are possible from phasing
out fuel subsidies. For the most part, reducing such distortions could
lower emissions and increase economic efficiency. However, subsidies are often introduced and price distortions maintained for social
and distributional reasons, and they may be difficult to remove.

Most current integrated assessment models do not reflect the
specific social and economic dynamics of the developing and transition economies well; for example, none of the existing models
addresses most market imperfections, institutional barriers, or the
operation of the informal sector in these countries. This can lead to
biases in global assessments when mitigation options and impacts
on developing or transition economies are valued as if their
economies operated like those in the developed countries.

Policy instruments may be identified at two different levels: those
that might be used by a group of countries and those that might be
used by individual nations unilaterally or to achieve compliance
with a multilateral agreement.
A group13 of countries may choose from policy measures and instruments including encouragement of voluntary actions and further
research, tradable quotas, joint implementation (specifically activities implemented jointly under the pilot phase14), harmonized
domestic carbon taxes, international carbon taxes, nontradable
quotas and various international standards. If the group did not
include all major greenhouse gas emitters, then there might be a
tendency for fossil fuel use to increase in countries not participating
in this group. This outcome might reduce the international competitiveness of some industries in participating countries as well as the
environmental effectiveness of the countries' efforts.

While relatively new, integrated assessment models of climate
change have evolved rapidly. Integrated assessment models tend to
fall into two categories: policy evaluation and policy optimization
models. Policy evaluation models are rich in physical detail and
have been used to analyze the potential for deforestation as a consequence of interactions between demographics, agricultural
productivity and economic growth, and the relationship between
climate change and the extent of potentially malarial regions. Policy
optimization models optimize over key variables (e.g., emission
rates, carbon taxes) to achieve formulated policy goals (e.g., cost
minimization or welfare optimization).

At both the international and national levels, the economic literature indicates that instruments that provide economic incentives,
such as taxes and tradable quotas/permits, are likely to be more costeffective than other approaches. Uniform standards among groups
of countries participating in an international agreement are likely to
be difficult to achieve. However, for one group of countries there
has been agreement on the application of some uniform standards.

Key uncertainties in current integrated assessments include the
sensitivity of the climate system to changes in greenhouse gas
concentrations, the specification and valuation of impacts where
there are no markets, changes in national and regional demographics, the choice of discount rates, and assumptions regarding
the cost, availability and diffusion of technologies.

11.

At the international level, all of the potentially efficient marketbased instruments could be examined during the course of future
negotiations. A tradable quota system has the disadvantage of
making the marginal cost of emissions uncertain, while a carbon tax
(and related instruments) has the disadvantage of leaving the effect
on the level at which emissions are controlled uncertain. The
weight given to the importance of reducing these different types of
uncertainty would be one crucial factor in further evaluating these
alternative instruments. Because of the lack of appropriate scientific
knowledge, there would remain a high degree of uncertainty about
the results of limiting emissions at specific levels. The adoption of

POLICY INSTRUMENTS TO COMBAT

Governments may have different sets of criteria for assessing international as well as domestic greenhouse policy instruments. Among these
criteria are efficiency and cost-effectiveness, effectiveness in achieving
stated environmental targets, distributional (including intergenerational) equity, flexibility in the face of new knowledge,
understandability to the general public, and consistency with
national priorities, policies, institutions and traditions. The choice of
instruments may also partly reflect a desire on the part of governments
to achieve other objectives, such as sustainable economic development, meeting social development goals and fiscal targets, or
influencing pollution levels that are indirectly related to greenhouse

either a tradable quota scheme or international taxes would have
implications for the international distribution of wealth. The distributional consequences would be the subject of negotiation. To
insure the practicability of such instruments, there is a need for
additional studies on the possible design of tradable quotas and
harmonized taxes and on the institutional framework in which they
might operate.

technology standards, performance standards, product bans, direct
government investment and voluntary agreements. Public education on the sustainable use of resources could play an important
part in modifying consumption patterns and other human behaviour. The choice of measures at the domestic level may reflect
objectives other than cost-effectiveness, such as meeting fiscal
targets. Revenue from carbon taxes or auctioned tradable permits
could be used to replace existing distortionary taxes. The choice of
instruments may also reflect other environmental objectives, such
as reducing non-greenhouse pollution emissions, or increasing
forest cover, or other concerns such as specific impacts on particular regions or communities.

Individual countries that seek to implement mitigation policies can
choose from among a large set of potential policies and instruments, including carbon taxes, tradable permits, deposit refund
systems (and related instruments) and subsidies, as well as
