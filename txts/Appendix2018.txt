1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability
1.1 Vulnerability to the health-risks of climate change
This indicator displays an index derived by taking mean of proportion of the
population over 65 years (1)2; the prevalence of cardiovascular, diabetes and chronic
respiratory diseases among population over 65years GBD 2016 estimates (2)3 and the
proportion of the population living in urban areas (3)4 as a measure of exposure to
urban heat island. The index ranges between 0 and 100 and is a measure of potential
vulnerability of a country to heat exposure. We display aggregated trends by WHO
regional classifications for the period 1990 to 2016.

Caveats

There is no consistent and universally accepted standard for distinguishing urban
from rural areas, in part because of the wide variety of situations across countries.
Most countries use an urban classification related to the size or characteristics of
settlements (3). This indicator does not include the existence of heat early warning
systems, or prevalence of cooling devices. Neither does it include the prevalence of
green areas in cities.

Future Form of
Indicator

GBD and urbanization estimates now are revised annually; the indicator will be
updated every year.

1.2 Health effects of temperature change
A baseline temperature was calculated as the average of summer (June, July, August
for the northern hemisphere, December, January, February for the southern
hemisphere) temperatures using a global grid of temperatures from the ERA-Interim
numerical weather reanalysis dataset, for 1986-2005. Using this same dataset,
temperature changes relative to the 1986-2005 average were calculated for every
grid point. The `area weighted' average of the grid was calculated by weighting each
grid cell by the relative area of that grid cell on the earth's surface, to take into
account the mapping from the 2D rectangular grid to the spherical earth's surface.
The `population weighted' average was calculating by weighting each grid cell by the
fraction of the total world population contained within that grid cell.
The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) provided
weather data for this indicator. ERA-Interim climate reanalysis data was used, as well
as a 1986-2005 climatology derived from ERA.
(https://www.ecmwf.int/en/research/climate-reanalysis/era-interim)
Population gridded data was obtained from the NASA Gridded Population of the
World (GPW) v4 using UN-adjusted population grid data
(http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4) at 5-year intervals from
2000-2020, with yearly population interpolated from these values.

1.3 Health effects of heatwaves
A heatwave was defined as a period of 4 or more days at a given location where the
minimum daily temperature was greater than the 99th percentile of the distribution
of minimum daily temperature at that location over the 1986-2005 reference period,
for the summer months.
The number and length of heatwaves was calculated for 1986-2017 over the weather
grid. The mean number and length was calculated for 1986-2005. The summer
months for each hemisphere were selected as in 1.1. The change in number and
length of heatwaves was then calculated for each year from 2000 to 2016 for each
location and the global area weighted means calculated for each year.
Yearly population grids were used as described in 1.1
The population over 65 count was calculated by matching demographic data the
fraction of people over 65 for each year from the UN WPP with country area
definitions, and projecting this onto the population grid. This effectively assumed that
over 65 fraction is constant across a given country's area.
The number and length of heatwaves grid was projected onto the population over 65.
A population weighted mean length was calculated and a number of exposures
(heatwaves x persons) were calculated for each year.

1.4 Change in labour capacity
The function relating the fraction of total work hours lost to Wet Bulb Globe
Temperature (WBGT) is given by the cumulative normal distribution function:

1
WBGT - Prodmean
  = (1 + ERF (
))
2
ProdSD  2
Where WBGT is WBGTmax, WBGTmean or WBGThalf and the parameters for a given
activity level (defined as the amount of internal heat generated in performing the
activity) are given in Table 1. Labour is divided into three sectors: service (activity
level of 200W), industry (300W), and agriculture (400W). The loss curves for 200W,
300W, and 400W are shown in Figure 1.

This fraction of work hours lost are clipped at both extremes. People take microbreaks during normal work so when the function predicts 10% or less work hours lost
it is assumed zero work hours are lost. It is further assumed that people always have
some capacity for work, no matter what the conditions so it is assumed that a 90% of
work hours lost is a maximum. The corresponding adjusted loss fraction is therefore
given by:
0,    < 0.1
   = { ,  0.1     0.9
0.9,    > 0.9
This is shown below for 200W, 300W, and 400W activity levels.

Labour loss fraction as a function of WBGT for different activity levels (Kjellstrom,
Freyberg, Lemke, Otto, & Briggs, 2018).

Adjusted labour loss fraction as a function of WBGT taking into account additional
assumptions.
WBGT is not included in typical climate data products such as ERA Interim. An
approximation of WBGT was calculated using dry bulb air temperature, dewpoint
temperature, and surface pressure (obtained from the ERA Interim gridded dataset)
according the method described in the 2017 Climate Countdown. This is calculated
for every 6-hourly time step.

Mean daily WBGT (WBGTmean) and daily maximum (WBGTmax) are calculated as the
mean and maximum of 6 hourly values. WBGThalf is calculated as the midpoint
between WBGTmean and WBGTmax.
The change in WBGT relative to the 1986-2005 reference period demonstrates a
strong trend of increasing WBGT mean globally over the past decades. This change is
calculated by averaging the daily mean WBGT for each location for each day of the
year for the period 1986-2005. Then for each day in the WBGT time series, the value
from the corresponding day from the average of the reference period is subtracted
from the WBGT value for that day. Finally, the global mean for each year is calculated
taking into account the relative areas of the grid cells.
Adjusted labour loss fractions are calculated for each grid cell for WBGTmean,
WBGTmax, and WBGThalf, using the equation above. Labour loss hours per person
for each day in each cell are calculated for the 3 power levels by assuming 4 hours of
labour at each WBGT temperature level:
Loss hours per person = 4 * Loss fraction at WBGTmean + 4* Loss fraction at
WBGTmax + 4* Loss fraction at WBGThalf (Kjellstrom, Freyberg, Lemke, Otto, &
Briggs, 2017)
Yearly total hours lost are calculated as the sum of the daily hours lost. These are
mapped below for 2000 and 2017 for each power level to illustrate the change in
hours lost per person per power level per year over time.
People working in agriculture are assigned a 400W work rate, industry a 300W work
rate and services a 200W work rate to determine hours lost per person in each
sector. Then, for each country, the working age population (15+ years from UN
demographic data) and the proportion of people working in the 3 sectors
(agriculture, industry and services from ILO supplied data) are assigned to the grid
cells occupied by that country.
The total yearly hours lost for each sector and in total is calculated by summing over
all grid locations for each year (excluding areas of water and permanent ice). The
yearly values in billions of hours lost are given below.

1.5 Health effects of precipitation extremes
Droughts
There are many definitions of drought, because there are many different aspects to
droughts. These are shown the in the figure below.

National Drought Mitigation Centre (US)
Meteorological drought relates to precipitation deficits, not considering water
reserves in the ground, lakes, etc. Although meteorological drought is somewhat
removed from the economic, social, and environmental impacts that are of interest in
the context of human health, it is a necessary precursor to these effects and is
therefore an important measure of risk. Furthermore, readily available climate data
allows the calculation of global meteorological drought trends through the definition
of drought indices.
In 2009, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) approved the Lincoln
Declaration on Drought Indices (LDDI). The LDDI recommends that "the Standardized
Precipitation Index (SPI) be used to characterize the meteorological droughts around
the world". The SPI is calculated by fitting a gamma distribution to historical monthly
precipitation data and standardising this to a normal distribution. The resulting values
give indicators of precipitation levels above or below historical trends. The SPI can
additionally be performed using sliding sums of monthly precipitation, for example to
3, 6, or 12 months (denoted as SPI3, SPI6, SPI12 respectively). This allows to take into
consideration effects at different time scales, such as seasonal effects.

Drought exposure indicator definition
The SPI can be calculated on the basis of the rolling sum of one or more months, for
each month the SPI value is calculated using the sum of precipitation for n preceding
months, denoted as SPI-n. SPI-6 (6 monthly rolling sum) was used for this indicator,
allowing the identification of annual-scale drought risks. The global area in extreme
drought was calculated by summing the areas of regions where SPI-6 is less than -1.5.
Exposures of drought were measured as person-months in drought - one exposure
event being one person exposed to one month in drought. Populations were not
distinguished by vulnerability (for instance, according to demographics or
socioeconomic status).
The yearly drought indicator is defined for a given location as the sum of the number
of months in extreme drought (SPI < -1.64).
This is presented for illustrative purposes at the total area in drought.
The drought exposure indicator for a given year at a given location is the number of
people at that location times the total number of months in severe drought, in units
of `person-months in drought'.
The global total number of person-months in drought is calculated as the sum over all
locations.
Meteorological drought (defined in terms of a rainfall deficit relative to historical
norms for a region is a necessary precursor to agricultural drought (soil water
deficiency) and hydrological drought (reduced stream flow and water stocks))

Global map of the change in number of severe drought events per year over the
period from 2000 to 2016, relative to the average number of events per year in the
1986-2005 reference period.

Extreme heavy rainfall
For this indicator, the method of Watts et. al 2015 which was used to estimate flood
risk in 2090 was adapted for present day and recent past events. Extreme rainfall
events were defined as being indicators of flood risk. And extreme event was defined
as starting when the 5-day rolling sum of daily precipitation exceeding the 10 year

return level and ending when it dropped below this value. The rolling sum of
precipitation was calculated for each day as the sum of the preceding 5 days total
precipitation (in mm).
The precipitation value corresponding to the 10 year return period was calculated
using the method described in 1. The time series of precipitations ppt was sorted in
order of magnitude. Each precipitation value was assigned a rank equal to its position
in the sorted list. The probability of exceedance for a given rank was calculating
according to the Gringorten (WMO, 1983) formula.

rank - 0.44
N + 0.12

Where N is the number of data points. The baseline precipitation threshold was
calculated by applying this method to daily total precipitation derived from ERAInterim for the period 1986-2005.
The number of extreme rainfall events per year in the period 2000 to present was
calculated by counting the number of periods for each grid cell where the
precipitation exceeded the baseline precipitation threshold, using the daily total
precipitation derived from ERA-Interim.
The number of exposure events was calculated by multiplying the number of people
at each location by the number of extreme rainfall events at that location. Population
data was derived from the NASA GWPv42.

1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability
1.6 Lethality of weather-related disasters
This indicator is based on the generic formulation from a climate change perspective
of disasters as a function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Year to year variation
was measured, showing the number of people killed as a proportion of those affected
by different hazard type, normalised by the strength of the individual hazards as a
measure of adaptive (or maladaptive) changes in national health care services and
the associated disaster preparedness and response.
Here, deaths are defined as the number of people who lost their life because the
disaster happened, and people affected as those requiring immediate assistance
during a period of emergency; hence requiring basic survival needs such as food,
water, shelter, sanitation and immediate medical assistance.

Data
Caveats

In 2018, the data has been presented as standardized anomalies, representing the
difference between the variable that year and average of the variable from 19902009, normalized by the standard deviation of the variable over the same period.
Only statistically significant (at 0.05 significance level) linear trends over time are
shown.
EM-DAT at the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) at the
Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium (http://www.emdat.be/).
One underlying assumption is that the normalised number of people killed by climate
related disasters is an accurate proxy for measuring health impacts of the climate.
Clearly this measure ignores the longer causal chains involving the interaction of
climate and health.
Finally, a further limitation is that this measure ignores the longer causal chains
involving the interactions of weather, climate, disasters, health and health services

Future Form of
Indicator

Future efforts will include a comparison of estimates of those exposed with those
affected. Additionally, the impact of replacing the number of people killed with the
number requiring assistance will also be explored.
A subsidiary indicator will come from the online Sendai Framework Monitor. Here
countries will start reporting against the Sendai Framework indicators and the DRR
related indicators of the SDGs. The first Sendai Framework and SDG progress report
will be released in 20191. This indicator therefore aims to expand to include country
specific progress in vulnerability levels of health service systems to climate risks in
relation to this monitoring data.

1.7 Global health trends in climate-sensitive diseases
This indicator displays generally unprocessed descriptive trends for selected diseases
retrieved from The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project database (1) over the
period 1990-2016. The derivation of estimates within the GBD study relies on
modelling, rather than analysing direct observations, and the GBD methodology has
already been described (1). The trends are aggregated and presented by WHO region
as mortality rates per 100,000 individuals per year over the period. We provide also
annual estimates by country in the supplement. As far as we can ascertain from the
GBD documentation, climate change and weather are not part of the covariates
included in the estimates, making it valid to examine GBD outputs in the light of
climate and weather data to formulate coherent inter-country comparisons. Trends
are described for: all causes of death, malaria, dengue, diarrhoeal diseases, proteinenergy malnutrition, heat and cold exposure, malignant melanoma and forces of
nature.

Deaths directly related to forces of nature have been adjusted for the effects of the

caused a substantial death toll from 1990 to 2016 where discounted by replacing
with the same countries' force of nature mortality for the previous year.

This is not a direct measure of the impact of climate change on death and disease.
Rather, it presents mortality figures for those diseases which are none to be
influenced by climate. The trends presented therefore do not show detection and
attribution of climate change to death. They do show the impact of climate relevant
and climate sensitive diseases on mortality rates globally since 1990.
GBD estimates are now revised annually. Future versions of this indicator may include
additional health conditions, may include morbidity as well as mortality, and may
extend to national and subnational scales. Increased interest in geo-spatial disease
analyses is likely to lead to additional information, such as fringe zone trends and
outbreaks, and associate patterns of diseases to climate anomalies, such as those
driven by the ENSO circulation. Future disease trends in the GBD estimates will be
linked to direct measurements in resource poor areas in Africa and Asia, for example
using longitudinal mortality registers from the INDEPTH network.1

1. Health Impacts of Climate Change
1.8 Climate-sensitive infectious diseases
Dengue
Context:
Cases of dengue have doubled every decade since 1990, with 584 million (236 million-1219
million) apparent cases in 2013, accounting for over 10,000 deaths and 114 million (073
million-198 million) disability-adjusted life-years.26 Beside global mobility, climate change has
been suggested as one potential contributor to this increase in burden.27 Aedes aegypti and
Aedes albopictus, the principal vectors of dengue, also carry other important emerging or reemerging arboviruses, including yellow fever, chikungunya, Mayaro and Zika viruses, and are
likely to be similarly responsive to climate change.
Methods:
Methods for calculating vectorial capacity (VC) follow Liu-Helmersson et al. (2014) and LiuHelmersson et al. (2016). VC refers to a vector's ability to transmit disease to humans. It
incorporates interactions between host, virus, and vector, assuming that all three of these
elements are present. Specifically, VC represents the average daily number of secondary cases
generated by one primary case introduced into a fully susceptible population, and is expressed
as:

a is the average vector biting rate, bh is the probability of vector to human transmission per
bite, bm is the probability of human to vector infection per bite, n is the duration of the extrinsic
incubation period - EIP, m is the vector mortality rate, and m is the female vector-to-human
population ratio. In our application, the time unit is 1 day and each of the vector parameters
depends on temperature, with parameter values derived from the literature, typically from
experimental data, as described in Liu-Helmersson et al., (2014). Diurnal temperature range
(DTR) was reconstructed using a representative daily temperature through a piece-wise
sinusoidal function based on the monthly average of daily minimum, maximum, and mean
observations.
Historical trends were derived by backcasting the models on data from the Climate Research
Unit (CRU) online database, time series (CRU-TS 3.22) of gridded (0.5 x 0.5 degrees) monthly
averages of daily temperature observations (minimums, maximum, and mean) for the time
period 1950-2016.
Future projections were derived using climate data under two greenhouse gas emission
pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) (Weyant et al., 2009), representing the contrast between very
strong mitigation action vs business-as-usual given consequent radiative forcing of greenhouse
gases in the year 2100 (+2.6 and +8.5 W m-2, respectively), based on CMIP5 (Taylor et al.,
2011, Warszawski et al., 2014) atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. For each emission
pathway, CMIP5 temperature datasets (min, max, mean resolution 0.5 x 0.5) were used.
Calculations from each of the five global models (NorESM1-M, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, IPSL-CM5ALR, HadGEM2-ES and GFDL-ESM2M) were averaged to derive a multi-model mean (ensemble).
We extracted the annual average VC values per grid cell to Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus
presence points provided in Kraemer et al., (2015) and averaged these values by country to get
country-specific trends in VC at monthly (seasonality analysis) or yearly time steps from 19502016 for each species. `Global vectorial capacity' indicates globally averaged values across all
countries.
Historical percentage change figures reported in the main text were calculated relative to a
1950s baseline (5 year average, 1950-54), either an average for the 2010s (5 year average, 20122016) to illustrate the overall trend accounting for interannual variability or for the most recent
year for which data were available (2016). Projected percentage changes in VC for each vector in
2030 (taken from 5yr average 2028-2032) was calculated relative to a present baseline (5 yr
average 2012-2016).

that VC is increasing on average in all months of the year, reflecting higher maximum values and

equivalent to a `business-as-usual' high emissions pathway while 2.6 is a strong mitigation
pathway, such that the difference illustrates the effect of GHG emissions on disease risk).

Vibrio
Context
Vibrio spp. are globally distributed aquatic bacteria that are ubiquitous in warm estuarine and
coastal waters with low to moderate salinity. V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus and nontoxigenic V. cholerae (non-O1/non-O139) are pathogenic in humans. They are associated with
sporadic cases of gastroenteritis, wound infections, ear infections or septicaemia, although they
have not been not responsible for widespread epidemics in the past.
Vibrio ecology, abundance, distributions and patterns of infection are often strongly mediated
by environmental conditions. Water temperature, salinity and turbidity predict the distribution
and abundance of V. vulnificus in Chesapeake Bay, with the number of infections increasing as a
result of recent local warming and changes in rainfall (28). Increased water temperatures also
explain outbreaks of Vibrio infections in countries bordering the Baltic Sea (22) and range
expansions in Alaska (29).

This indicator focuses on mapping environmental suitability for pathogenic Vibrio spp. in coastal
zones globally (<30km from coast).
Methods:
The indicator uses thresholds of >18C for Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and <30 PSU for Sea
Surface Salinity (SSS). These values were derived on the basis of a consensus in the literature
(Muhling et al., 2017; United States Food and Drug Administration, 2005; Parveen et al., 2008;
Martinez-Urtaza et al., 2008). Estimates for SST were obtained from NOAA Optimum
Interpolation 1/4 Degree Daily Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) Analysis, Version 2 for the
period 1982-2017. This dataset is provided by the NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD, Boulder, Colorado,
USA, accessible from https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/ . The salinity fields were created from
daily data obtained from Mercator Ocean Reanalysis,
(http://marine.copernicus.eu/tutorials/global-ocean-week-2016-mercator-ocean-reanalysis1993-2015glorysv4/).
Here we report suitability at two levels. First, we calculated the percentage of coastline globally
that experienced suitable conditions for Vibrio infections and summarised the results across
three latitudinal bands (northern latitudes = 40-70N; tropical latitudes = 25S-40N; and
southern latitudes = 25-40S). Second, we calculated suitability in two focal regions in which
human Vibrio infection is frequently observed, the Baltic Sea and the North East coast of North
America (36-50N). For the Baltic (main text) and NE US coast (Supp Materials), we show the
percentage of coastline suitable for Vibrio infections. In addition, for the Baltic (main text) we
show the number of days per year suitable for outbreaks. The percentage change figures
reported in the main text were calculated relative to a 1980s baseline (5 year average, 1982-86),
either an average for the 2010s (5 year average, 2013-2017) to illustrate the overall trend
accounting for interannual variability or for the most recent year for which data were available
(2017).

Percentage coastline suitable for Vibrio spp. by latitude along the US northeast coastal region
(36N-50N). This Latitude-time plot (Hovmoller diagram) indicates poleward expansion of
suitable environments for Vibrio spp. in this region. For latitudes > 39 and similarly to the Baltic
Sea, there is a general widening of the Vibrio spp. season as well as an increase in the amount of
shoreline affected.

Malaria
Context
Temperature, precipitation and relative humidity are climatic factors that impact the abundance
and feeding cycle rate of Anopheles mosquitoes, which transmit the Plasmodium parasites that
cause malaria. Temperature also drives the development rate of Plasmodium parasites within the
mosquito vectors (Grover-Kopec et al., 2006). Temperatures within the range 18C to 32C are
considered most suitable for P. falciparum, while P. vivax has a lower temperature limit (Gilles
1999). Below 15/18C the development of the parasite ceases while above 32C the survival of
the mosquito is compromised. Relative humidity greater than 60% is also considered as a
requirement for the mosquito to survive long enough for the parasite to develop sufficiently to
be transmitted to the human host stage. Rainfall and surface water are needed for the egg laying
and larval stages of the mosquito life cycle, with monthly rainfall accumulation of at least 80mm
considered suitable for transmission (Grover-Kopec et al., 2016).
A recent study found a significant increase in elevation of the lower temperature limits for the
development of malaria parasites in Ethiopia (Lyon et al. 2017). Increasing temperatures in the
region are eroding the perceived barrier to malaria transmission, allowing more favourable
conditions to begin climbing into densely populated highland areas. Highland areas are the most

densely populated agro-climatic zone in sub-Saharan Africa, occupying just 4.4% of the land area
but 19.4% (44 million) of the population.
The malaria indicator focuses on mapping environmental suitability globally, while considering
the variation in malaria burden by region, management status, and elevation.
Methods
The number of months suitable for malaria transmission per year from 1950 - 2016 was calculated
globally. Suitability is based on empirically-derived thresholds of precipitation, temperature and
relative humidity for two primary parasites causing malaria (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax).
Monthly observations of temperature, precipitation and vapour pressure data from the Climate
Research Unit (CRU TS4.01) (Harris et al. 2014) were downloaded using the KNMI Climate Explorer
(https://climexp.knmi.nl/). The variables were extracted at a 0.5 spatial resolution over land.
Elevation data at a 0.5 spatial resolution was obtained from JISAO, University of Washington
(http://research.jisao.washington.edu/data_sets/elevation/).
Following New et al., (2002), relative humidity (RH) was estimated using the formula:
 =




x 100,

where  is vapour pressure and  is saturated vapour pressure (in hPa) at mean air temperature
T in C, given by:
 = 6.108 exp[17.27  /(237.3 + )] .

Climatic suitability was defined as the coincidence of precipitation accumulation greater than 80
mm, average temperature between 18C and 32C, and relative humidity greater than 60% for P.
falciparum (Grover-Kopec et al. 2006). Suitability for P. vivax was calculated using the same
thresholds with the exception of a lower average temperature limit of 15C (Gilles, 1999; Patz and
Olson, 2006). The combined values are an indication of the lower limit for potential malaria
transmission for each species.
The mean number of months per year with suitable climate conditions for malaria transmission
was then calculated across 3 continents (Africa, Asia and the Americas) according to the dominant
parasite
present
(Africa
=
P
falciparum,
other
regions
=
P.
vivax)
(https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/malaria/index.html). We further subdivided the analysis by
malaria management status, following country classifications from Newby et al., (2016) who
classified countries in the following categories: malaria controlling, malaria eliminating, or malaria
free. Here we include outputs for the category malaria controlling (Main Text and Supp. Materials)
and malaria eliminating countries. In addition to management status, we stratified the analysis by
elevation to contrast trends in highland areas (>=1500m) and lowland areas (<1500m). The
percentage change figures reported in the main text were calculated relative to a 1950s baseline
(5 year average, 1950-54), either as an average for the 2010s (5 year average, 2012-2016) to
illustrate the overall trend accounting for interannual variability or for the most recent year for
which data were available (2016).

Publication trends
Methods for the analysis of publication trends on climate-sensitive infectious diseases follow Lu
and Peng (2017), updated to the most recent complete year for which data were available
(2017). Briefly, we conducted a systematic review of the literature using bibliographic databases

including the ISI Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PubMed. We used a multi-step
approach, first searching abstract/title/keywords using strings of [(`climate change' or `climate')
and `infectious disease'], followed by retention of articles focussing on disease in humans. Then,
a second round of searching using further keywords describing more specific climate-disease
elements was conducted. Finally, a manual screen according to specific rules (namely, we
removed duplicated, non-English, non-peer reviewed, non-human related articles and those
that did not report a health outcome related to climate change, such as review, editorial, or
commentary articles) was performed. Essential article information was extracted from each
paper for the summary, including: 1) direct information including the title, journal, publishing
year, authors; 2) place name and spatial scale of the study area; 3) study period; 4) research
methods used; 5) types of infectious disease studied; 6) types of climatic variable studied; and 7)
the conclusions made about the direction of impacts of climate change on human infectious
disease.

Data
Caveats

As above.
Each of the disease indicators reported here focus on environmental suitability, as determined
by climatic conditions known to enhance infection risks. For malaria and Vibrio these are based
on the intersection of climatic thresholds known to be limiting for the growth or transmission of
the respective pathogens. For dengue, the vectorial capacity (VC) output is derived from a
mechanistic model that includes parameters that are both climate-sensitive and insensitive to
climate. The VC model thus reflects the contribution of vector, pathogen and host traits to
disease transmission in addition to capturing the climatic components of disease risk.
Dengue
Key caveats and limitations of the VC model and its parameterisation are fully described in LiuHelmersson et al., (2014, 2016). VC should not be confused with actual dengue cases, although
it is an indicator of the risk of infection.

Vibrio
The results are derived on the basis of suitable SST and SSS conditions only, and do not include
other potentially important drivers (e.g. globalisation), environmental predictors of pathogenic
Vibrio infections (e.g., cholorphyll-a, turbidity) nor disease case data. Nevertheless, these
associations have been explored and are reported in the supporting references included above.
In the global analysis, the slope of the trendlines over the time series is mostly flat for the
tropical/subtropical region and the southern hemisphere. However, the SST-only suitability
shows a strong upward trend in the southern hemisphere, indicating that on average
temperature conditions are also improving growth conditions for Vibrio in these areas, while SSS
is generally limiting. However, locally suitable SSS conditions will also occur in these regions on
the basis of, for example, variation in local rainfall and river runoff, which can make these
regions sporadically suitable for Vibrio infections.

Malaria
These results are based on climatic data, not malaria case data. The malaria suitability climate
thresholds used are based on a consensus of the literature. In practice, the optimal and limiting
conditions for transmission are dependent on the particular species of the parasite and vector
(Grover-Kopec et al. 2006). Control efforts might limit the impact of these climate changes on
malaria or conversely, the climate suitability may either enhance or hamper control efforts
(Snow et al. 2017).
The disease indicators will be reported upon annually and assessed against the baseline data
and trends presented here. Other climate-sensitive infectious diseases in addition to malaria,
Vibrio and dengue will be added through time and the current indicators refined. In future, we
intend to expand efforts to project trends (as for dengue) using available models (e.g., RCPs
from AR5). In addition we may expand efforts to link environmental suitability information to
disease outcomes e.g., via disease case or surveillance data. Numerous jurisdictions currently
already undertake indicator- (e.g., annual country- or regional-level reporting of confirmed
human cases), event-based (e.g., outbreak investigation and `epidemic intelligence'), and
biosecurity (e.g., sentinel site) surveillance for infectious diseases, vectors or key zoonotic hosts.
Many of these datasets and methods of analysis could be made available and leveraged in
future for the Lancet Countdown. For example, EU member states already report cases of
notifiable diseases, zoonotic diseases, and outbreaks of food-borne and zoonotic disease, while
vector surveillance remains voluntary (Lindgren et al., 2012).
1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability
1.9 Food security and undernutrition
1.9.1 Terrestrial food security and undernutrition
Ten-year average yields
Data for trends in yield by country, are calculated in the following way. First, time series yield
data for grains (aggregated) were collected for all countries from 1960 to 2016 from FAOSTAT.
To enable consistency across time, where countries have become independent/split after 1960,
data from their pre-independence status are used. Thus, for Slovakia, for example, pre-1989,
Soviet Union data are used; 1989-1992 Czechoslovakia data are used; and from 1993 onwards,
Slovakia data are used. A moving ten-year average yield was then calculated for each country.

Finally, whether that average has been trending upwards or downwards over a ten-year period
was determined.
Prevalence and number of people under-nourished
Data are sourced directly from FAOSTAT.
Crop duration loss
Actual crop yields vary from year to year not only with variations in weather, but also with
changes in variety, farming practices and the occurrence of pest and disease. Crop yields as
estimated by crop models are sensitive to the precise form of the crop model, and many models
do not account for the short-term extremes that can significantly affect yields. The effect of
year-to-year climatic variability on crop yields is therefore here represented by an agriclimatological proxy indicator, calculated from observed climate data and characterising
potential variability in maize yield. Maize is selected because it is an important traded and
subsistence crop.
There are several potential proxies for maize yield, including the number of hot days during
critical periods in the growing season (e.g. Lobell et al., 2011a;b; Gourdji et al., 2013; Challinor et
al., 2016) and the accumulated temperature between lower and upper thresholds over the
growing season (e.g. Challinor et al., 2016). The proxy used here is based on crop duration,
defined as the time taken in a year to accumulate the average growing season accumulated
temperature (Challinor et al., 2016). If the accumulated temperature total is reached early, then
the crop matures quickly and yields are lower than average. Here, we define the crop duration
loss as the difference in the time taken to accumulate the average growing season accumulated
temperature.
The index is calculated at a spatial resolution of 0.5x0.5o, across the area of land under maize
cultivation (Monfreda et al., 2008). It is assume that the growing season is 110 days long, and
starts each year at the average planting date (Sacks et al., 2010). Accumulated temperature is
calculated between a lower threshold of 7oC and an upper threshold of 30oC (Challinor et al.,
2016), with higher temperature capped at 30oC. Climate data are taken from the CRU TS4
gridded monthly observed climate data set (Harris et al., 2014), and synthetic daily data are
estimated for each grid cell by applying a regional average daily anomaly to the monthly value.
The regional average daily anomaly is calculated from the WATCH (Weedon et al., 2011) daily
climatology.

Different ways of calculating the agri-climate index using different data sets would produce
slightly different time series, as would the use of different agri-climate proxies. However, the

1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability
1.9 Vulnerability of food systems and under-nutrition
1.9.2 Marine food security and undernutrition
Thirteen large marine basins (FAO fishing areas) which are important in terms of projected
impacts and vulnerabilities associated with climate change were selected (Table S2). The
basins analysed represent major marine ecosystems in terms of climate, ecosystem and
geographical diversity (tropical, subtropical, and arctic zones) and are major FAO fishing
areas; thus changes in SST and marine primary productivity can have significant impacts on
marine life and fish stocks. Twenty-one countries located in these basins were selected in
order to attribute the impacts of climate change (more specifically sea surface temperature;
SST) to deterioration of major coral reef sites (internationally protected areas) and the
consequent decreased consumption of capture-based fish. SST data availability ranged from
2003 to 2015 and therefore, to obtain the highest data alignment possible, the data
considered on coral reef sites (NOAA Coral Reef Watch Zones) were those of 31 August 2009
and 2015. Moreover, the data concerning both capture-based and farmed-based per capita
fish consumption in the investigated countries from 1980-2015 were collected and analysed.
There is a lack of information in the available databases such as FAO on fish species
composition of the captured and farmed fish products. This could in turn lead to some
concerns about the methodological approach used to calculate 3 intake. More specifically,
most of the approaches are based on fish intake, which usually ignore or underestimate

variations in 3 contents of different types of fishes, and especially capture-based compared
with farmed-based fish.
Given the unfavourable variations in fish capture over the last three decades, it seems that
countries in general have implemented strategies toward increased fish farming to
compensate for decreased capture-based per capita fish consumption. However, owing to
the substantially lower 3 contents of farmed fish compared with captured fish, positive
health impacts of this approach is in question. Therefore, it is suggested to obtain the
composition of the captured and farmed fish products. Such findings could assist in more
accurately assessing 3 intake and the consequent human health-related impacts as
influenced by climate change through jeopardizing marine primary production or in another
word, marine-based food security and nutrition. Moreover, the resultant implications could
serve as guidelines for the policy makers and the authorities of the agriculture &
fisheries/import & export departments to more effectively plan in favour of high 3 content
fish species. For instance, future efforts could be directed toward shifting the existing fish
farming activities from fresh water (in-land waters) to marine water (mariculture systems).

Note: As quoted from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch
Operational Near-real-time Twice-weekly Global 50 km
Satellite Coral Bleaching Thermal Stress Monitoring
Product Suite, "Bleaching Degree Heating Weeks (DHW)
is the 12-week accumulation of HotSpot values that are
at least 1oC. A DHW value of one is equivalent to one
week of HotSpot at 1oC and a DHW of two is equivalent
to two weeks of HotSpot at 1oC or one week of HotSpot
at 2oC. The Bleaching HotSpot is a special type of SST
anomaly showing the difference between the nighttime
SST and the maximum monthly mean (MMM) SST
climatology. The HotSpot data contain only positive
values for identifying potential thermal stress conducive
to coral bleaching."

1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability
1.10 Migration and population displacement
This Appendix covers two sets of case studies for which climate change is the sole
contributing factor for forced migration, as described in peer-reviewed academic
papers. First, updates from the list of case studies in Watts et al. (2017). Second, any
new case studies listed in the literature.
For the Carteret Islands of Papua New Guinea, some authors (e.g. Schwerdtle et al.
2018) continue to attribute the forced migration to climate change, even suggesting
that sea wall construction failed to protect the islands from erosion. Conversely,
Connell (2016) downplays climate change impacts for the moment, instead
considering natural cycles and local human changes including sea wall construction
as causing witnessed erosion. The Carteret Islands are thus no longer considered by
the literature as being a clear case study of climate change migration. Connell (2016)
reinforces that Takuu, Papua New Guinea would also not be considered such a case
study.
Coastal Fijian villages including Vunidogoloa, Narikoso, and Denimanu continue to be
mentioned as relocating due to climate change (McNamara and Des Combes, 2016
with this discourse critiqued in Hermann and Kempf 2017). While evidence is
presented of coastal changes necessitating relocation, evidence is not presented to
link those coastal changes to climate change impacts. Again, it might be that sea
walls have caused or exacerbated the observed erosion.
Coastal Alaskan villages remain highlighted as case studies for climate change
migration, although with no updates to the numbers (Albert et al. 2018). Louisiana's
Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments Program (LA SAFE) has started to be
described in peer-reviewed papers (Herrmann 2017; King 2017), suggesting that the
numbers of people considered as climate change migrants from Louisiana might
increase slightly from this location. Nonetheless, human changes other than climate
change affecting this coastline include river engineering, pollution, dredging,
infrastructure construction, and resource extraction.
Continuing empirical observations of low-lying atolls, such as for Tuvalu (Kench et al.
2018), currently confirm that, with measurable sea-level rise, prospects nonetheless
remain for habitation through adaptation, which means that appropriate action is
needed to avoid forced migration. For Kiribati, Hermann and Kempf (2017)
deconstruct the country's land purchase in Fiji which has been attributed to the
intention for all people of Kiribati to become climate change migrants. They explain
how the official governmental rendering of the purchase is for economic and food
reasons related to climate change, but not migration, even though several authors
presume the migration link without evidence. Meanwhile, Solomon Islands villages
relocating were reaffirmed to have non-climate change factors as major influences
on the environmental changes which are forcing movement, along with decisions
being made to relocate now due to assumptions that sea-level rise would eventually
force movement in the future (Albert et al. 2018). Countries with low-lying atolls
remain ambiguous as case studies for climate change migration.

Meanwhile, projections for sea-level rise under climate change continue to be crosschecked and refined (Mengel et al. 2018; Nerem et al. 2018) with little substantive
changes in the values or underlying mechanisms summarised in Watts et al. (2018).

Caveats from the literature regarding sea-level rise estimates:
(a) Sea-level rise will not be the same everywhere, with significant regional variations
from the global mean (Carson et al. 2016; Clarke et al. 2016).
(b) The rate of sea-level rise is expected to accelerate in coming years (Fasllo et al.
2016; Watson 2016).

(c) Sea-level is 0.71  0.20 mm/y slower than expected because the climate is driving
increasing water storage on land (Reager et al., 2016).
(d) Sea level might have natural, multi-decadal oscillations (Serazin et al., 2016).
People from many locations are assumed to be migrating due to the possibilities given
as being climate change only, but analysis shows that the assumptions are not always
supported (Table 3). In fact, no outcome is certain. Even for coral reefs, Perry et al.
(2015) postulate that coral growth under some scenarios could keep up with sea-level
rise and other ecosystem changes. Corals' ability to flourish under rapid sea-level
changes was demonstrated empirically in the Solomon Islands by Saunders et al.
(2016) after sudden tectonic subsidence. Similarly, mangroves so far are
demonstrating robustness to sea-level changes while nevertheless being damaged by
human activity (Woodroffe et al. 2010).
A linear cause-effect assumption is made of:
climate change (impacts)  migration  health impacts
Each step has nuances, subtleties, and provisos.
For the first step, migration due to climate change (impacts) only is hard to discern
because migration has always happened throughout human history for multiple
reasons, some climate- and environment- related; some not linked at all to climate or
environmental factors; and most often due to a combination of factors. Many
assumptions behind migration potentially linked to climate change are hard to prove
as being climate change only or are challenging to differentiate from many other
environmental factors, such as specific natural hazards or changes to food, water,
and/or livelihood conditions which manifest for multiple reasons.
For the second step, migration itself, no matter how or why migration occurs, does
not necessarily induce specific health outcomes. Migrant and host health could be
improved, worsened, or not affected, depending on how the migration is handled.

Future
Form of
Indicator

Consequently, the main caveats for this indicator is that no linear cause-effect
sequence happens, mainly because the outcomes from a situation depends much
more on how a situation is dealt with than on climate change or migration per se.
Two main prospects exist for this indicator's future. The first is observational. As
estimates and observations of sea-level rise, ocean acidification, sea ice, and coastal
erosion continue, the indicator's thresholds might change. The second is how the
indicator is constructed. Consideration could be given to how managing migration
affects health in order to overcome a principal caveat. Irrespective, this caveat can
never be fully overcome because health impacts can be managed, if we choose to do
so, irrespective of climate change or migration scenarios or realities.
In later iterations of this indicator, descriptions can be provided of locations which
have switched categories, been removed entirely, or been added as new. As these
iterations approach 2030, the tables given for each indicator are likely to expand
substantially because the number of studies is expanding immensely on (i) observed
climate change impacts with confirmed attribution, (ii) projecting such impacts into
the future; and (iii) migration linked to climate change. Consequently, the potential
impacts of climate change on migration are likely to become much clearer towards
2030, including possible case studies where such migration has occurred. Caution is
still needed regarding numerous cases where attribution is stated with confidence,
but the link upon closer examination is not robust. While the indicator here is

presented in a highly focused and rigid manner, in order to keep it scientifically
precise and robust, expanding knowledge and observations might permit the
indicator in 2030 to be much more comprehensive and less narrow without losing
robustness.
Given the complexity of the observational science and the challenges articulated by
the caveats, the ideal form of this indicator given adequate time and resource would
be a map of all potential migration location origins under different climate change
scenarios, animated over time to 2100. Although climate change projections are
published for the next 10,000 years (Clarke et al., 2016), social and technological
changes will be immense over such time scales, making it difficult to provide any
confidence for suggestions regarding how and where people will live and be
responding to environmental stimuli long into the future. If people choose to settle
other planets, solar systems, or galaxies over the next several millennia in order to
escape a dying Earth--as much science fiction (not peer reviewed) has postulated--
would they be climate (change) migrants? Such questions are beyond the scope of
Lancet Countdown. Consequently, to achieve this proposed map with scientific
value, it should not go beyond 2100 and at least one dedicated post-doctoral
researcher would be needed, preferably with a GIS and migration specialty because
the number of caveats, provisos, uncertainties, and attribution challenges would
lead to multiple layers and indicators on a map.

Suppleme
ntary
Informati
on

To improve the estimates, other than specific case study updates, further research
would aim to model (i) the percentage contribution of climate change to migrationrelated decisions and (ii) the length of time which migration-related decisions are
brought forward due to climate change impacts. A third area for further work is to
compile and estimate the number of people worldwide who are forced not to
migrate with climate change as the sole contributing factor.
Locations possibly needing to migrate due to climate change only
The proviso `possibly' in this title refers to technical solutions being developed to help
the people stay in or near their current locations, irrespective of the climate change
factors mentioned. These schemes include artificial settlements floating above or built
directly on the current locations (Yamamoto et al., 2014), whether above an island
being submerged, an eroding coastline, or destabilised permafrost. Financing for these
technical proposals has so far been absent and does not seem likely in the near future,
plus technical challenges remain.
Nonetheless, they are possibilities and it is difficult to project the social and political
make-up of the world over the coming decades. The range of possibilities covers
shifting the trillions of dollars per year in military spending and fossil fuel subsidies to
tackling climate change all the way through to abandoning anyone affected by climate
change through refusing to permit them entry into other countries. The most likely
outcomes are somewhere in between such extremes. Consequently, the migration of
these territories remains `possibly' rather than `definitely'.
Additionally, defining `migrating' for this category is not straightforward. Does it mean
moving house, street, municipality, island, or country? Would it include moving 5 m,
50 m, 500 m, or 5 km? For example Pingelap atoll in the Federated States of Micronesia
has significant area above 15 m above sea level but all land is within 300 m of the
coast. If the people of Pingelap move their houses or move to different houses due to

sea-level rise, is that migration, because they are still living in effectively the same
location? If so, then a street-by-street census would be needed of Pingelap and every
other coastline in the world to determine exactly who would need to migrate, due to
regional and local variations in how sea-level rise manifests.
Consequently, a country rather than community level is presented (Table 4),
identifying the countries which might (not definitely) not be able to remain as
countries under thermal expansion. Apart from those people already migrating due to
climate change, this indicator yields four countries totalling a population of 584,000
people possibly needing to migrate due to thermal expansion. All four are small island
developing states (SIDS), but this is coincidental; all countries have been considered.

As a guess, the countries in Table 4 would need to migrate between 2040 and 2050.
This statement is a guess, because the decision to migrate will most likely be political
strongly influenced by specific extreme events rather than a strategic analysis of
possible futures and outcomes from those futures. This statement is made on the basis
of history and how societies have typically dealt with disasters and creeping
environmental changes.
As well, other countries could rapidly be added to Table 4. If coral reefs around Fiji or
Seychelles experience high mortality, then near-coastal areas could potentially
experience rapid erosion. Two provisos preclude large numbers of people in each
country, or significant parts thereof, from being forced to migrate. First, while far from
an ideal approach, extensive coastal engineering (which both countries already
implement) could forestay major coastal erosion. Second, plenty of land is available in
those countries which could theoretically take migrants--although with practical
problems regarding access, ownership, and heritage protection--and few people
would necessarily need to migrate far in theory, leading to the problem of defining
`migration' mentioned above. If land tenure or ecosystem protection precludes
settling in areas, is the root cause of migration farther afield climate change or local
human decisions regarding land?
All these factors emphasise the `possibly' word in this indicator's title. They also
highlight that this indicator's value is a minimum, from Table 5's numbers, but many
more possibilities for migrants exist under this category--most notably erosion linked
to sea ice disappearance.
Locations which might possibly need to migrate only due to climate change, if ice sheet
collapse occurs
In the coming decades, the numbers of people migrating due to ice sheet collapse is
likely to be near zero. The reason is that the collapse process itself followed by ice melt
and sea-level rise takes a minimum of decades and possibly up to centuries. As we

move from the decade scale to the century scale, it is impossible to project social and
technological developments. It is too simplistic and it would be indefensible to just
calculate the number of people living within a certain elevation above sea level--
especially since over the coming decades, these population numbers will change.
Nonetheless, some websites host data on population in coastal zones such as
Columbia University http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu and the World Bank
http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.POP.EL5M.ZS but these are not part of the
peer-reviewed literature. The UN has also developed the indicator `Percentage of

http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/natlinfo/indicators/methodology_sheets/oceans_se
as_coasts/pop_coastal_areas.pdf into which the World Bank and Columbia University
data input, but again, it is not published in the peer-reviewed literature. Instead, peerreviewed publications provide the following analyses:
* In 1990, 450 million people lived within 20 km coast and below 20 m above sea level
(Small and Nicholls, 2003). The provided plots permit higher resolution estimates to
be obtained with reasonable precision, but accuracy is questionable.
* In 1994, 1.88 billion people (33.5% of the global population) lived below 100 m above
sea level (Cohen and Small, 1998), which was the highest vertical resolution
investigated.
* In 2000, 634 million (10% of the global population), of whom 360 million are urban,
lived below 10 m above sea level (McGranahan et al., 2007), which was the highest
vertical resolution investigated.
* With 2000 as a baseline, the population living below 10 m above sea level and
connected to the ocean will change from 638 million to, depending on the societal
scenario chosen, 1,005-1,091 million by 2050 and 830-1,184 million by 2100
(Merkins et al., 2016).
* With 2000 as a baseline, the population living below 10 m above sea level on
contiguous land which borders a major body of water will change from 702.167
million to, depending on the societal scenario chosen, 492.74-1,145.946 million by
2100 (Jones and O'Neill, 2016).
* The number of people living below 5 m above sea level is calculated to be 290 million
(5.4%) in 1990, 380 million (5.6%) in 2010, and 460 million (5.5%) in 2030 (Kummu
et al. 2016).
* For 2000-2006, 67.1-153.1 million people live below 1 m above sea level; 308.1391.4 million people live below 5 m above sea level; and 557.1-709.1 million people
live below 10 m above sea level (values are also available for below 2, 3, and 4 m
above sea level) depending on the models used (Lichter et al. 2011). This paper also
provides a review of similar literature to date, which plenty of further estimates of
the coastal population.
Consequently, this indicator yields zero extra people migrating due to ice sheet
collapse by 2100; that is, no one would need to migrate who are not already
migrating. After 2100 and in ensuing centuries--without appropriate action--based
on the above literature, as an order of magnitude, perhaps over one billion people
+/- 50% might need to migrate due to ice sheet collapse. This estimate is based on
ice sheet collapse only; as noted above, has low robustness because it is mainly
guesswork with large errors; and has no relation to the estimates of `climate
migrants' and `climate change refugees' which have been debunked by Gemenne
(2011) and Hartmann (2010). Instead, it simply states that if ice sheets collapse and
in the absence of major social and technological changes (an unlikely situation by

2100), then in the decades and centuries after 2100, over one billion people +/- 50%
might need to migrate due to climate change only.

Mental health indicator proposal

Data

Death rates due to self-harm (suicide) data for females and males for each
state and territory were taken from the Australian Bureau of Statistics
standardised death rates for every year of the decade 2007-16 (latest
available year at the time of writing). Standardised rates are deaths per
100,000 of estimated mid-year population adjusted for age structures (see
http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/3303.0~20
16~Main%20Features~Intentional%20selfharm:%20key%20characteristics~7). With 28 (5.71%) missing values, we were
able to extract a total of 132 observations for the decade (8 jurisdictions * 10
years * 2 sexes, less 28 missing values). We did not impute missing values
primarily because death rates are highly variable across years and jurisdictions
and imputation would have led to the introduction of too much error. We
identified two extreme outliers in suicide rates, both from the NT, one for
males in 2007 and one for females in 2015. These outliers heavily biased initial
results and were removed.
To match the death rates time series, mean annual maximum temperatures
for each state and territory were calculated from Bureau of Meteorology
climate data archives for every year of the same decade, 2007-16 (see
http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/statement_archives.shtml).
Maximum annual recorded temperatures for each weather station in each
district in each jurisdiction were summed and the total value was divided by
the number of observations to derive a mean annual maximum temperature
for that year. This process was repeated for all eight jurisdictions for each of
ten years, delivering a total of 77 observations (there were no data for WA for
2007-09). An identical process was used to derive the mean difference
between each annual temperature observation and the long-term moving
mean (calculated from all available data). This delivered 76 observations with
four missing data points. In both cases, there were missing values for a very
small number of weather stations in some jurisdictions in some years. We did
not impute these missing values but used the available data from the weather
stations in that district and all the other districts to calculate mean scores for
that state/territory for that year. Following initial exploratory analyses, data
for Antarctica (district 300, Macquarie Island) were removed from the dataset
for Tasmania because these data were extreme outliers and heavily biased
initial results. For example, in 2015 (an average year with no deviation from
the long-term mean), the maximum temperature from the Macquarie Island
station was 6.6C when the equivalent value for the rest of Tasmania was
16.57C with a mean variation of +0.18C.

Methods

We began by conducting one-way analyses of variance to test whether mean
suicide rates and mean maximum annual temperatures differed significantly
by jurisdiction. All means on both variables differed significantly from all other
means indicating that each state and territory had its own unique heat and
suicide profile for the decade 2007-16.
Pearson Product Moment correlations indicated that, nationally over the
decade, suicide rates were significantly but weakly positively correlated with
mean maximum annual temperatures (r=.23, p-value<.05). In a multiple linear
regression model, sex and temperature each made statistically independent
contributions to explaining variance in suicide rates. A scatterplot was
produced to examine the shape of the relationship; in contrast to a linear
regression line, which fit the data significantly but weakly for males and nonsignificantly for females (Figure 1a), a cubic regression line fit the data
optimally and well for both females and males (Figure 1b). It also appeared
evident from the scatterplot that the pattern of associations between suicide
and temperature differed by sex (two clearly separate groups of observations
were evident as shown below; blue markers = males, green markers =
females).
To test this, we conducted a linear regression analysis using sex and mean
maximum annual temperature as simultaneous predictors of suicide rate,
controlling for annual state-level temperature anomalies to hold constant
annual deviation from the long-term mean. Standardised beta coefficients
indicated that both predictors significantly independently predicted suicide
rate, sex particularly strongly, such that higher temperatures and being male
predicted a higher suicide rate. Standardised residuals statistics indicated the
possible presence of two different groups (reflecting the findings from the
scatterplots). The sample was therefore split by sex and separate analyses
were conducted for males and females. These analyses fit the data slightly
better for males but not for females, for whom the results were nonsignificant. This was inconsistent with the findings from the scatterplots.
The introduction into the regression analysis of dummy variables for seven of
the states and territories (NSW, the most populous state, was the reference
category) produced a strong model, adding substantively to the model fit, and
revealed that, when accounting for state/territory, temperature was a much
stronger predictor of suicide than the previous models indicated. We noticed
that some of the beta coefficients were negative (indicating higher suicide
rates in the presence of cooler weather). Based on exploratory analyses, the
states were allocated to one of two groups based on their mean maximum
annual temperatures, warm (NSW, VIC, QLD, SA, WA, NT) or cool (TAS, ACT).
Separate regression analyses by warm or cool state/territory categories
produced well-fitting linear associations between mean maximum annual
temperature and suicide rate, and revealed sex differences in the nature and
strength of this relationship (see main text).

Caveats

The use of standardised rates rather than raw data overcomes errors in
suicide rates due to inter-year and between-jurisdiction variations in

population size and age profile. However, there are well-rehearsed problems
with suicide data, problems that cannot easily be overcome (such as
suspected substantial under-reporting). Thus, to establish patterns of
relationship between unusually hot or cool weather and mental health,
investigations using other mental health outcomes will be needed.
Using mean maximum annual temperature is a crude measure of exposure to
unusually hot or cool weather, especially in states and territories with
substantial climate variation (e.g., NSW has hot dry desert, wet sub-tropical,
cold mountainous and temperate coastal climate zones). Annual temperature
also fails to account for seasonal variation in weather, which is associated
with mental health and suicide. Further, only ten years of data have been
analysed and so we cannot account for longer-term trends or for exposures
and impacts in previous years. Additionally, population size, characteristics
and dispersion vary enormously among jurisdictions. The use of more finegrained (but still substantively meaningful) geographic resolution will help
address these problems and also permit within-year analyses which are not
possible with a cell size of eight states and territories. This indicator, if used in
future years, will be refined to account for these data limitations and
opportunities.
We found preliminary evidence of important interactions between gender,
location, underlying climate and suicide. This is not the appropriate place to
analyse these factors but they need to be investigated in detail because they
have substantive implications for policy and service development and,
ultimately, for human health and wellbeing. In this respect, the jurisdictionlevel analysis that we have conducted is useful and appropriate because state
and territory governments are key actors in adaptation planning and
implementation, and in health and related service delivery. Finally, we found
no clear upward or downward trend nationally in the strength of the
association between mean maximum annual temperature and rates of death
by self-harm over the decade and the reason for this will need to be
investigated at finer spatial resolution.

2. Adaptation, planning and resilience for health
2.1 National adaptation strategies or plans for health
The collection of data for the number of countries having a national health and climate
strategy or plan approved by the relevant government was explained in the Lancet
Countdown report in 2017 (Watts et al, 2017). Briefly, WHO has been actively engaged with
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in developing tools for more
systematic provision of country specific information and monitoring of progress on
protecting human health from climate change. This collaboration, which involves working
closely with national health authorities, has led to the development of the WHO UNFCCC
climate and health country profiles. The country profiles present evidence on the climate
hazards, expected health impacts, potential health co-benefits of mitigation actions and
national policy response in countries. In 2015, WHO launched a biennial national survey,
entitled the "WHO Climate and Health Country Survey" to monitor national progress on
climate and health action. Findings from the survey are reported in the climate and health
country profiles and were used to report on health adaptation indicators in the 2017 Lancet
Countdown report. The survey was conducted for the second time in 2017/2018 yet the
results are currently pending publication. Consequently, an update for this indicator, based
on the 2017/2018 WHO Climate and Health Country Survey, is planned for the 2019 Lancet
Countdown report. The interim information provided in this report therefore focuses on a
qualitative analysis of national strategies and plans to gain insight into key questions
regarding the development, content and quality of these documents.
Sixteen national health adaptation strategies/plans were collected and analysed for the
following countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Cook Islands, Egypt, Ethiopia,
Jordan, Laos, Madagascar, Morocco, Nepal, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania and Tunisia.
It should be noted that the aim of this review was to collect the most recent and available
documents and therefore, the strategies and plans assessed do not necessarily correspond
directly to those reported in the 2017 Lancet Countdown Report.
The countries with H-NAPS were Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nepal, Seychelles, South Africa,
and Tanzania. It is anticipated that with the availability of necessary resources, support
and key guidance tools, such as the WHO Operational framework for building climate
resilient health systems, the number of low and middle income countries developing HNAPs as part of the NAP process will steadily increase in coming years (WHO, 2015).
The qualitative analysis evaluated the available national health adaptation strategies/plans
through the use of a standard assessment tool. The assessment tool consisted of nine key
questions, outlined below:
1. The title of the document (to gain more understanding of the nature and scope of
the document, e.g. strategy, plan, health component of the NAP).
2. The timeframe identified in the document.
3. Identifying if the document was developed as part of the UNFCCC NAP process. If
so, was there a clear plan of coordination and synergy with health determining
sectors to ensure that the H-NAP was established in a coherent manner with regard
to the overall NAP.
4. Were gaps in capacity and knowledge identified?
5. The prioritized health outcomes.

6. Which of the ten health system components outlined in the WHO Operational
framework for building climate resilience were addressed in the document (WHO,
2015)?
7. Was a clear implementation strategy developed for integrating climate change
adaptation into health-related planning processes at all levels?
8. Was the development of a national monitoring and evaluation system for health
adaptation to climate variability and change anticipated?
9. Would the strategy/plan be subjected to regular revision and updating in future?
Collection of national health adaptation strategy/plan documents was based on voluntary
submission through the WHO Climate and Health Country Survey combined with outreach
to ministry of health and national health authority focal points through WHO country and
regional offices to request the most recent and publicly available documents.
The collected national health strategies/plans do not represent an exhaustive search of all
national health adaptation documents for all WHO Member States and new documents or
revised documents may be available at the time of publication. As such, the results of this
evaluation should be considered indicative not conclusive.
The WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will be conducted biennially and will continue
to be the primary source of data to track this indicator. This indicator will be updated
biennially as new data from the survey is published. The goal over the long-term is to gather
data from all WHO member States, however as the coverage of the survey will expand over
time, the next update of data from the 2017/2018 WHO Climate and Health Country Survey
will aim to provide data on approximately 80 WHO Member States. The future evolution of
this indicator will explore the monitoring and review of the existing strategies/plans and
progress on level of implementation of strategies/plans. With more countries initiating the
NAP process, alignment of the health component with the overall NAP will also be more
closely monitored. Interim information regarding the specific content of national
strategies/plans, as explored in this qualitative analysis, may be re-assessed in the future.

2.2 City assessments of climate change risks
CDP serves as an official reporting platform for the Compact of Mayors, and
administrates, collects and analyses a global survey of city based environmental and
climate change data on an annual basis. In 2016, 553 cities participated in the survey,
with 449 reporting publically that included questions on emissions, adaptation
assessments and plans. Respondents to the surveys to describe the magnitude of the
impact of climate based hazards (extremely serious, serious, less serious) and identify
three critical assets or services that may be most impacted.
7 regions were represented in the survey (Africa (n = 45, 9%), East Asia (n = 16, 3%),
Europe (n = 118, 25%), Latin America (n = 123, 26%), North America (n = 137, 29%), South
and West Asia (n = 9, 2%) and South Asia & Oceania (n = 30, 6%). There were no
respondents from the Middle East. Respondents to the surveys to describe the magnitude
of the impact of climate based hazards (extremely serious, serious, less serious) and
identify three critical assets or services that may be most impacted.
Based on this data two indicators can be developed. The first is a global cities-based
indicator of government areas that have undertaken a climate change risk or vulnerability
assessment. The second is global cities-based indicator of the perceived vulnerability of
health infrastructure to climate change. In terms of trend analysis for the indicators, it is

important to note that there was a change in the options offered for the variable that the
perceived vulnerability of health infrastructure to climate change indicator is based. In
2016 the health infrastructure option was labelled "Health and Community"
infrastructure. To make the option more specific to health infrastructure, in 2017 this
option was divided into "Public Health" and "Community & Culture". In terms of
comparability and continuity, in 2016, 49% of cities chose Community and Culture as the
infrastructure they perceived to be most vulnerable to climate change. This rate was held
constant in 2017 with 51% of cities noting that they perceived climate change would
seriously impact Public Health infrastructure. Furthermore only 2% indicated that they
believed Community and Culture Infrastructure would be vulnerable to climate change.
This would further indicate that the majority of cities choosing the Health & Community
indicator in 2016 were selecting this option as they perceived the greatest threat was to
public health infrastructure rather than community infrastructure.
Using the World Bank (WB) country income category groupings (High, Upper middle,
Lower Middle and Low income) Table 1 indicates that 58% of cities that responded to the
survey are from High Income countries, 30% are from Upper Middle-Income countries,
8% from Lower Middle Income countries and 4% are from Low Income countries.

In future, this indicator will aim to expand the number of cities included in the survey and
to have a more regionally representative sample. Also, the quality of the climate change
risk assessments and implementation rate of any associated plans would be important to
analyse.

2: Health Resilience and Adaptation
2.3 Implementation of IHR Core Capacity Requirements
Under the International Health Regulations (IHR (2005)) all States Parties are required to
have or to develop minimum core public health capacities to implement the IHR (2005)
effectively. IHR (2005) also states that all States Parties should report to the World Health
Assembly annually on the implementation of IHR (2005). In order to facilitate this process,
WHO developed an IHR Monitoring questionnaire2, interpreting the Core Capacity
Requirements in Annex 1 of IHR (2005) into 20 indicators for 13 capacities. Since 2010,
this self-reporting IHR monitoring questionnaire is sent annually to National IHR Focal
Points (NFPs) for data collection. It contains a checklist of 20 indicators specifically
developed for monitoring the development and implementation of 13 IHR capacities. The
method of estimation calculates the proportion/percentage of attributes (a set of specific
elements or functions which reflect the level of performance or achievement of a specific
indicator) reported to be in place in a country.
The core capacities to implement the International Health Regulations (2005) have been
established by a technical group of experts, as those capacities required to detect, assess,
notify and report events, and to respond to public health risks and emergencies of
national and international concern. To assess the development and strengthening of core
capacities, a set of components are measured for each of the core capacities, by
considering a set of one to three indicators that measure the status and progress in
developing and strengthening the IHR core capacities. Each indicator is assessed by using a
group of specific elements referred to as `attributes' that represents a complex set of
activities or elements required to carry out this component. As it is difficult to measure
these indicators with a simple question that requires one `yes' or `no' answer, one to three
questions are derived from each attribute, and these are administered through a
questionnaire. The status of performance for an indicator, component and core capacity is
determined by the presence of attributes. If a country does not indicate a particular
attribute as absent or present, it is counted as absent for scoring purposes. The annual
questionnaire has been conducted since 2010 with a response rate of 72% in 2012, 66% in
2016 and 85% in 2017, and 100% of countries reporting at least once since 2010. Annual
reporting results are complemented by after action reviews, exercises, and joint external
evaluation (JEE).
International Health Regulations (2005) Annual Reporting. Data are available through the
Global Health Observatory Data Repositoryhttp://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.IHR?lang=en
Human resources capacity reflects human resources available to implement the
International Health Regulations Core Capacities. Amongst other attributes, this capacity
includes having conducted a human resource needs assessment, as well as having
developed appropriate training and staff development plans.
Surveillance capacity summarizes two indicators in the IHR questionnaire `Indicator-based
surveillance includes an early warning function for early detection of a public health
event', and `Event-Based Surveillance is established and functioning'. This capacity score is
used here as a proxy for a health system's ability to anticipate and identify outbreaks and
changing patterns of climate-sensitive infectious diseases, such as zoonosis and food
related outbreaks.
Preparedness capacity reflects `Multi-hazard National Public Health Emergency
Preparedness and Response Plan is developed and implemented', comprised of the

Caveats

n

presence of a plan, the implementation of the plan, and the ability for this plan to operate
under unexpected stress. It also reflects whether `Priority public health risks and resources
are mapped and utilized' which includes conducting national risk assessment of various
hazards, disease outbreak patterns, local disease transmission patterns, contaminated
food or water sources, etc.; as well as mapping of local infrastructure, health facilities,
major equipment and supplies, staff, funding sources, experts, equipment, laboratories,
institutions, NGOs to assist with community-level work, and transport.
Response capacity reflects the availability and functioning of public health emergency
response mechanisms, and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) at national and hospital
levels.' This capacity is an important proxy for the ability of the health system to mobilize
effective response when shocks or stresses are detected
There are some limitations to considering these capacities as proxies of health-system
adaptive capacity and system resilience. Most importantly, IHR monitoring questionnaires
responses are self-reported. Secondly, the countries that report IHR implementation
annually differ from year to year within these regional aggregate scores. Thirdly, IHR Core
Capacity Requirements are not specific to climate change, and hence whilst they provide a
proxy baseline, they do not directly measure a country's adaptive capacity in relation to
climate driven risk changes. Fourthly, these findings capture potential capacity - not
action. Finally, the quality of surveillance for early detection and warning is not shown and
neither is the impact of that surveillance on public health. Response systems have been
inadequate in numerous public health emergencies and thus the presence of such plans is
not a proxy for their effectiveness. Nonetheless, these four capacities provide a useful
starting point to consider the potential adaptive capacity of health systems globally.
At the beginning of 2018, in compliance with the recommendations of the IHR Review
Committee on Second Extensions for Establishing National Public Health Capacities and on
IHR Implementation , and following formal global consultations with States Parties held in
2015, 2016, and 2017, and 2018, the WHO Secretariat replaced the IHR Monitoring
questionnaire by the "IHR State Party Self-assessment Annual Reporting Tool" (SPAR).
This has strong implication for the future of this indicator: preparedness and response
capacities have now been merged into one capacity called "C8: National health emergency
framework"; one capacity relevant to climate adaptation and resilience has been added (
"C9: Health services provision"); and a in change capacity grading has been introduced,
which requires countries to grade their capacity indicators in progressive levels from 1 to 5
as pose to the previous "Yes/No/Not know answers options.
Hence, a new baseline will be generated next year for this indicator and capacity levels will
be reported from 1 to 5, instead of in percentage values.

2. Adaptation, planning and resilience for health
2.4 Progress on the adaptive capacity to the health-risks of climate change

Methods

This indicator computes adaptive capacity of a given country to manage threats posed by
infectious diseases taking into account core competency in key areas. The key areas are
in surveillance, legislation, Food safety, human resources, laboratory, point of entry,
response, preparedness, risk communication and zoonosis which form part of
International Health Regulations (IHR) Core Capacity Monitoring Framework5,6.
Specifically, this indicator displays how the core capacities influence the abundance of
Aedes aegypti vector for each country and aggregated by WHO regions. The IHR core
capacities data covers the period 2010-2016, so we present trends for this period. We
compute adaptive capacity by taking the product of vectorial capacity (VC) and vector
abundance and dividing by the average core capacity. The derived abundance is
normalized to range between 0 and 1 before taking the product. The formula below is
used for the computation of adaptive capcity.
Vulnerability = Impact / Adaptive Capacity
We used the temperature dependent dynamic models developed by Jing et al 7to
compute Vectorial capacity and the rainfall and temperature dependent abundance
model for Aedes aegypti vector abundance computation, an extension of the model
developed by Yang et al 8.
Computation of VC and abundance estimates was done for each 0.5x0.5 grid points in the
CRU dataset and subsequently aggregated to country level using shapefiles.
The CRU TS 4.01 9climate data drives both the VC and the abundance models.

The abundance models generates predictions and not observed frequencies in relation to
climate conditions, and by so should be considered a potential abudance estimate. The
IHR data is self-reported by countries and may therefore include reporting bias which
would affect this indicator. A reduction of this indicator while keeping the vector hazard
constant does not correspond to full protection, but indicates rather that the situation
has improved by important improvements in core capacities.
The future indicator will make use of the estimated protective effect (relative risk) of the
IHR core capacities in modifying the climate induced hazard on vectors and virus
interactions.

from the 47 countries that provided additional detail on the status of climate
service provision to the health sector: 10 reported to have initiated
engagement with the health sector (Chile, Guinea- Bissau, Kuwait, Mexico,
Mozambique, Malawi, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Tunisia and Ukraine), 13 reported
to be undergoing health sector needs definition (Barbados, Cote d'Ivoire,
Dominica, Egypt, France, Kazakhstan, The former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, Peru, Philippines, Senegal, Swedish, Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela and South Africa), 7 reported to be co-designing climate products
with the health sector (Belgium, Finland, Georgia, Hungary, Niger, Singapore
and United Republic of Tanzania), 14 reported that tailored products are
accessible to the health sector(Antigua and Barbuda, China, Cameroon, Spain,
Fiji, Croatia, Kenya, Latvia, Morocco, Mali, Russia, El Salvador, Serbia, Trinidad
and Tobago), and 3 reported that climate services are guiding health sector's
policy decisions and investments plans (Austria, Indonesia, United States of
America).
The current data source from WMO only considers climate services provided
by NMS. It is unclear the degree to which other providers, such as academic

institutions and research projects, private sector products, products from other
Ministries, or regional and global products and services are being used, in
proportion to services made available by NMS.
The open questionnaire can be updated at any time by WMO members,
therefore the figures here reported may change over the year. As each country
may update their profile information at different moments in time, snap shots
do not reflect progress for any given year but rather information provided until
a certain date.
The current questionnaire does not record the number of WMO members that
do not provide climate services to the health sector.
The questionnaire captures information on the provision of climate services,
the status of service provision to the health sector (divided in 5 categories) and
the type of services provided (divided in 5 categories as well). However, only
the provision and status of climate service has been reported here due to
uncertainties over the quality of the data on the type of services provided.
Questions do not capture the source or quality of the service and only one of
the answer option covers the utility of the climate services. They do not
capture whether data originates from national meteorological observations or
is resulting from regional or global products. They do not capture the potential
use of all-sector forecasts or outlooks which are accessed and used by the
health sector.
The WMO and WHO have some differences in their individual Member States.
Responses collected from WMO Member States, were reclassified according to
WHO Region. WMO members that are not individual WHO members were
excluded from the analyses and include Macao and Hong Kong (reported as
China), Curacao and St. Maartens. The following WHO Members are not
Members of WMO, therefore representative data is not available:
Andorra, Equatorial Guinea, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, San Marino.
Future Form of
Indicator

The WMO Country Profile Database Integrated questionnaire is expected to be
improved to capture binary yes/no responses, reflecting affirmative nonprovision of climate services. This will allow comparison with the 2017 baseline
indicator, citing the rate of climate service provision to the health sector
among respondents.
Future versions are likely to provide greater insight on the status of climate
service provision for the health sector, and the type of service provided.. Other
complementary WMO surveys capturing specific product types, user
satisfaction, and application areas, may be publically available in the future to
inform future editions of this indicator.
The World Health Organization (WHO) conducts a regular climate and health
country survey with ministries of health or national health authorities in its 194
Member States. In 2017, this survey added indicators on the inclusion of
meteorological information in integrated risk monitoring and early warning
systems for climate-sensitive diseases. The 2017 WHO climate and health
survey findings are expected to be reported in the 2019 Lancet report and may
be used to improve this indicator.

2.6 National assessments of climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation
for health
Similar to the methods provided for indicator 2.1, national assessments of
vulnerability, impacts and adaptation for health (health V&As) were monitored
through the 2015 WHO Climate and Health Country Survey. A subset of 34 existing
health V&As were collected either through the WHO Climate and Health Country
Survey or through WHO-assisted country and regional projects. These countries
include: Albania, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso,
Cambodia, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, India, Iran, Kazakhstan,
Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Malta, Mongolia,
Morocco, Nepal, Russia, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Zambia.
As mentioned for indicator 2.1, since the WHO Climate and Health Country Survey
findings will only be updated every two years, the interim information provided in
this report focuses on a qualitative analysis of the available national health V&As in
order to gain insight into key questions regarding the development and content of
these documents. It should be noted that the aim of this review was to collect the
most recent and available documents and therefore, the national assessments
included do not necessarily correspond directly to those reported on in the 2017
Lancet Countdown Report.
The focus of this qualitative analysis was to evaluate available national health V&As
considering the following key questions:
* The geographic coverage of the assessment (national or subnational);
* The prioritized climate-sensitive health outcomes;
* Prioritized health outcomes; quantitative or qualitative sensitivity analysis
towards climate change and variability; quantitative or qualitative
projections of future disease burden; and description of the most vulnerable
populations;
* Whether the adaptive capacity of the health sector was evaluated; The
adaptation options outlined and an assessment of the linkages between
adaptation needs and measures identified.
Collection of national assessments of vulnerability, impacts and adaptation for health
were based on voluntary submission through the 2015 WHO Climate and Health
Country Survey combined with outreach to ministry of health and national health
authority focal points through WHO country and regional offices to request the most
recent and publicly available documents.
The collected national health V&As do not represent an exhaustive search of all
national scientific assessments for health vulnerability to climate change for all
WHO Member States and new documents or revised documents may be available
at the time of publication. As such, the results of this evaluation should be
considered indicative not conclusive. In addition, some of the documents included
were not strictly vulnerability and adaptation assessments (nine included only
vulnerability or adaptation in their titles, and six were entitled in other ways, e.g.
Climate Change and Health) hence the scope and structure were not perfectly

Future Form of

aligned with that of a health V&A. Nonetheless, the evaluation provided valuable
insight on some of the aspects included in a health V&A assessment.
The WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will be conducted biennially and will
continue to be the primary source of data to track this indicator. This indicator will
be updated biennially as new data from the survey is published. The goal over the
long-term is to gather data from all WHO member States, however as the coverage
of the survey will expand over time, the next update of data from the 2017/2018
WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will aim to provide data on approximately
80 WHO Member States. Interim information regarding the specific content of
national assessments of vulnerability, impacts and adaptation for health, as explored
in this qualitative analysis, may be re-assessed in the future.

2. Adaptation, planning and resilience for health
2.7 Spending on adaptation for health and health-related activities
The `Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change' dataset is the same data source
that used in the previous Lancet Countdown report. It measures spending on
economic activities related to adaptation and resilience to climate change. It was
developed by data research firm kMatrix in partnership with numerous
stakeholders, and includes the key adaptation measures identified by the IPCC. This
classification of adaptation activities was originally developed from attempts by the
UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to measure adaptation in
2009/2010. The definition of adaptation activities was extended through
collaboration with the Greater London Authority in 2014, and updated through a
project with Climate-KIC in 2017. This added several new industrial sectors as well as
significantly expanding the activities under health and healthcare.
The methodology used for data acquisition and analysis is based on a system called
as `profiling', which was originally developed at Harvard Business School to track
and analyse technical and industrial change. This is the basis for building taxonomies
of economic activities and value chains, which can then be populated with estimates
of key economic metrics like sales value and employment by triangulating
transactional and operational business data to estimate economic values. This
methodology is particularly valuable in areas where government statistics and
standard industry classifications are not available. When measuring an industry or
sector, the new taxonomy is populated from the bottom up, searching for evidence
for the ideal definition and including only economic activities where sufficient
evidence is available.
For each transaction listed in the adaptation economy data, a minimum of seven
separate sources must independently record the transaction for it to be confirmed
and included in the database. Triangulating data from multiple sources permits large
volumes of unsorted, fragmented data of different types from different sources to
be processed to arrive at more accurate estimates of transactional value that would
not be possible using a single source. For the adaptation economy, data are
produced to a confidence level of around 80%. Accessing and analysing multiple
types of data is also key to identifying the `purpose' behind an economic activity,
which is key for accurately assigning economic activities to the adaptation dataset.

Developing the new definition of adaptation and resilience to climate change
involved the top-down taxonomy of the entire make and mend' economy, and then
adaptation and resilience in all forms. Then these categories were filtered to isolate
economic activities that can be strictly identified as being relevant to adaptation and
resilience to climate change. The taxonomy of A&RCC is drawn from 11 sectors of
the economy at-large: Agriculture & Forestry, Built Environment, Disaster
Preparedness, Energy, Health/Health Care, ICT, Natural Environment, Professional
Services, Transport, Waste and Water.
There are a number of activities across different sectors that are `health-related' in
the adaptation and resilience to climate change dataset, outside of the strictlydefined healthcare sector. The indicator design therefore required the definition of
those activities from the other 10 sectors of the A&RCC data that can be clearly
related to health, and thus should be included in a definition of `health-related'
adaptation spending. The robust interim approach used for last year's Lancet
Countdown was again adopted for this year's Lancet Countdown. The 'healthrelated' activities consists of the activities of the Healthcare/Health Sector, Disaster
Preparedness and Agriculture adaptation activities from the kMatrix dataset. A
methodology is under development to define a full health-related adaptation
definition across the entire A&RCC dataset.
Geographical Coverage

Data

The A&RCC dataset has global coverage for 226 countries and territories. Data has
been reported for a subset of countries and territories for whom adaptation
spending data, regional and income classifications, and population estimates are
available. This year's indicator covers 188 countries and territories with data
reported in the A&RCC dataset, and that are assigned a region in the WHO regional
classification and an income group in the World Bank income group classification.
Per Capita values are based on 183 countries that also have population estimates
from the IMF World Economic Outlook.

Comparison Data:
The classification of WHO Regions was taken from the WHO Data Repository
Metadata.
WHO metadata reports the World Bank Income Grouping values from 2016
(released July 2016, based on 2015 calendar year data). Therefore, World Bank
income groups have been taken from the Bank's June 2017 update, which was
based on 2016 calendar year data.
2016 and 2017 Population and GDP estimates from the April 2018 update of the IMF
World Economic Outlook were used to calculate a fiscal year values for 2016/17.
For comparability, global total values present the global total for countries or
territories that are included in the regional and world bank analysis - it does not
include the 38 countries and territories which have neither a WHO Region nor a
World Bank Income Group. Most of these are overseas territories or sub-national
jurisdictions with relatively lower levels of adaptation spending. However, several

larger states or jurisdictions that are not included in this global total are: Hong Kong,
Taiwan and Puerto Rico.

Caveats

Data in this year's indicator covers 188 countries and territories that have data
reported in the A&RCC dataset, and that are assigned a region in the WHO regional
classification and an income group in the World Bank income and lending groups
(Per Capita values are based on 183 countries with population estimates from the
IMF World Economic Outlook).
Economic activity or transactions are only measured where there is an economic
`footprint', i.e. where there is transactional/financial data available to be measured.
Therefore, public sector spending without an economic `footprint' (government
spending on salaries, for example), cannot be measured. It also not possible to
directly identify what percentage of measured spending is public versus private.
Values are not currently adjusted for inflation. Values of sales generated are not
directly comparable with values derived from national statistics.
The reference period is the financial years 2015/16 and 2016/17. Further historical
data is likely to be available in the future.

Future Form of
Indicator

There will be three major developments in the future form of the indicator.
The first will be the development of the `three-tier' definition of;
1) adaptation activities with direct, important health impacts
2) those with less direct or more minor health impacts
3) those with no health impact or too tenuous a health impact.
Secondly, in the future it is likely to possible to present historical data for the
indicator, in order to provide trend data on change in spend over time.
Finally, in the future the aim is to develop an indicator of adaptation spending as a
percentage of the overall health sector spend and health-related spend as a
percentage of the entire economy (represented by 24 industries), compiled using
transactional data.

2.8 Health adaptation funding from global climate financing mechanisms
This indicator used the Climate Funds Update (CFU
http://www.climatefundsupdate.org) 20data on total gross flows of all multilaterally
governed funds focused on climate change from January 1 2003 to December 31
2017. The data also includes funds from bilateral organisations, but excludes funding
from bilateral to multinational organisations, to avoid double counting of funds. For
this indicator, the CFU data selected was for adaptation only and the "approved
funding" figure was used to calculate adaptation funding. To calculate the adaptation
funding that has been allocated to health, the following sectors were selected: "basic
health", "health" and "health, general". Although it is recognised that other
adaptation measures can have important health co-benefits, drawing out how
effectively adaptation projects benefitted and accounted for health is complex and
developing a consistent methodology for doing so would require more resource.
Therefore, only those projects earmarked specifically as health were included in the
analysis here.

Data
Caveats

Future Form of
Indicator

Climate Funds Update
Some of the data was incomplete and so those adaptation projects that did not have
the year noted could not be included, as it would then not be possible to accurately
show the annual funding for adaptation and health adaptation, or changes in funding
over time. To counter this, project documents were searched for and, where
available, the project approval date updated in the CFU data. However, this was not
possible for all projects. Furthermore, these results show funding through global
climate financing mechanisms only and do not show the additional funding support
given to these adaptation projects (for example, from UN agencies or national
governments). The funding mechanisms included in the CFU data are shown in Web
Table 1. Climate funding from Canada, the US, Japan and Denmark is not included in
the CFU data; as such the figures presented here are likely to be underestimates.
Additionally, the data presented in Figure 1 is not cumulative. Although most projects
run for more than one year, there was insufficient information in the CFU data
detailing the allocated spending for each project year and so only the total approved
adaptation funding in each given year was shown.
In future, this indicator could show all funding streams that fund adaptation
generally and health adaptation specifically. The contributions of different funding
streams could then be analysed and new funding streams (such as national
governments) shown.

3.1: Carbon intensity of the energy system
Technical definition is the tonnes of CO emitted for each unit (TJ) of
primary energy supplied.
The rationale for the indicator choice is that carbon intensity of the energy
system will provide information on the level of fossil fuel use, which has
associated air pollution impacts. Higher intensity values indicate a more
fossil dominated system, and one that is likely to have a higher coal share.
As countries pursue climate mitigation goals, the carbon intensity is likely
to reduce with benefits for air pollution.
The indicator is calculated based on total CO2 emissions from fossil fuel
combustion divided by Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES). TPES reflects
the total amount of primary energy used in a specific country, accounting
for the flow of energy imports and exports.

The data are available for most countries of the world, for the period 19712015.
This indicator is based on based on the International Energy Agency (2017)
dataset CO2 Emissions From Fuel Combustion: CO2 Indicators, via the UK
data service (http://stats.ukdataservice.ac.uk/).
The indicator does not provide information on the share of different fossil
fuels, their use in different sectors, and the absolute levels of usage. These
are all important elements in understanding the air pollution emissions,
and their impacts. Therefore, additional indicators (3.2 & 3.3) provide
additional complimentary information.
This indicator will need to be updated to provide the data for the most
recent years, which have seen important shifts in the use of fossil fuels,
particularly coal.

3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits
3.2. Coal phase-out
Two indicators are used here; i) Total primary coal supply by region / country (in EJ
units), and ii) Share of electricity generation from coal (% of total generation from
coal).
These indicators are important to enable tracking of change in coal consumption at a
regional and country level. Due to the level of coal used for power generation, a
second indicator tracks the contribution to electricity generation from coal power
plants in selected countries. As countries pursue climate mitigation goals, the use of
coal is likely to reduce with resulting benefits for air pollution.
The indicator on primary energy coal supply is an aggregation of all coal types used
across all sectors (from the IEA energy balances). The indicator on the share of

electricity generation from coal is estimated based on electricity generated from coal
plant as a percentage of total electricity generated.

Future
Form of

The data are available for most countries of the world, for the period 1971-2015. Only
the period from 1990 has been used, due to data gaps for selected countries prior to
1990. Countries or regions with large levels of coal use (as a share of generation, or in
absolute terms), have been selected.
This indicator is based on based on the extended energy balances from the
International Energy Agency (2017). The specific dataset is called World Extended
Energy Balances, and is sourced via the UK data service
(http://stats.ukdataservice.ac.uk/).
These indicators provides a proxy for air quality emissions associated with the
combustion of coal. Further work is required to convert coal use by sector and type
into emissions of different air quality pollutants.
In the future, this indicator set could be developed to also estimate the actual air
pollutant emissions associated with coal use. This will require sectoral use, coal type
(both of which are available) and appropriate emission factors.
As per 3.1, this indicator will need to be updated to provide the data for the most
recent years, which have seen important shifts in the use of coal.

3.3. Zero-carbon emission electricity
Two indicators are used here, and presented in two ways; i) Total low
carbon electricity generation, in absolute terms (TWh) and as a % share of
total electricity generated (to include nuclear, and all renewables), and ii)
Total renewable generation (excluding hydro), in TWh, and as a % share of
total electricity generated.

The increase in the use of low carbon and renewable energy for electricity
generation will push other fossil fuels, such as coal, out of the mix over
time, resulting in an improvement in air quality, with benefits to health.
The renewables (excluding hydro) indicator has been used to allow for the
tracking of rapidly emergent renewable technologies. For both indicators,
generation, rather than capacity, has been chosen as a metric as the
electricity generated from these technologies is what actually displaces
fossil-based generation. Countries with large levels of low carbon
generation (as shares, or in absolute terms), or with higher fossil
dependency, have been selected.
The data are again taken from the IEA extended energy balances. The
absolute level indicators are total gross electricity generated aggregated
from the relevant technology types. The share indicators are estimated as
the low carbon or renewable generation as a % of total generation.

This set should be developed to include an indicator to assess the direct

approach being to compare the emission intensity of the current system
with a counterfactual case, which does not have the additional share of RE

3.4. Access to clean energy
The 2017 report used the SDG 7.1.2, which is:
"The proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology
is calculated as the number of people using clean fuels and technologies for
cooking, heating and lighting divided by total population reporting that any
cooking, heating or lighting, expressed as percentage.
"Clean" is defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations
(i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance
WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion." As defined by
the SDG Metadata: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-07-0102.pdf.
The SDG indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO.
Estimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban and rural population for a

given year are obtained separately using a multilevel model (Bonjour et al., 2013).
This is done at the country level.

Data

In the 2018 report, as no update to the SDG indicator has been provided, further
information around the access and use of energy in the household sector has been
shown. The use of energy in the residential sector is drawn from the IEA extended
global.
This SDG indicator is based on data from the UN SDG database:
https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/.
The additional energy usage and access is based on data from the International
Energy Agency 2018: World Energy Balances 2017. UK Data Service. DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.5257/iea/web/2017.

Caveats

The energy access data is from the IEA energy access database:
https://www.iea.org/energyaccess/database/.
The indicator is based on the main type of fuel and technology used for cooking as
cooking occupies the largest share of overall household energy needs.
However, this will not reflect household fuel use activities when multiple fuels are
used through the day or year. There is also a lack of data on the type of fuel and
technologies used for home heating and lighting.

Share of energy type for households

Future
Form of
Indicator

The data from the IEA on residential energy flows and energy access provide an
indication of both the access to electricity and the proportion of the different types
of energy used within the residential sector. These provide an important picture on
how access and use might be interacting.
An ideal indicator going forward be further details on the fuel mix used by
households for different demands (heating, cooling, cooking, hot water, lighting
and other plug loads) for a range of income groupings within the country. The
pressures of interest are the GHG and air pollution emissions that contribute to
climate change and health outcomes, but also the increased access to energy use,
which has broader socio-economic benefits.

3.5 Exposure to ambient air pollution

Sub-Indicator

3.5.1 Exposure to air pollution in cities

Methods

This indicator represents annual average concentrations of fine particulate
matter (PM2.5) air pollution in selected cities. The estimates are modelled
outputs from the Data Integration Model for Air Quality (DIMAQ) (Shaddick
et al, 2018).

Data

DIMAQ incorporates data from multiple sources in order to provide
estimates of exposures to PM2.5 at high spatial resolution (0.1x0.1)
globally. The model has been further developed to account for time in the
calibration of satellite with ground measurements. Sources of data include:
ground measurements from more than 6,000 monitoring locations in some
3,000 cities around the world, satellite remote sensing; population
estimates; topography; and information on local monitoring networks and
measures of specific contributors of air pollution from chemical transport
models
The DIMAQ model calibrates data from these sources with ground
measurements. The relationships between the various sources of data may
be complex and will vary between regions due to differences in the
composition of PM2.5 and other factors. DIMAQ has a hierarchical structure

within which calibration equations are produced for individual countries
using, as a priority, data from that country where available. Where data
within a country is insufficient to produce accurate estimates, it is
supplemented with regional information.
The cities included in this indicator are 308 (out of a total of 309) globallyrepresentative cities from the Sustainable Healthy Urban Environments
(SHUE) database for which an air pollution estimate was obtained from
DIMAQ, extracted for the 0.1x0.1 grid square containing the city's central
coordinates. The data represent median estimates for each SHUE city.
SHUE is an initiative, funded by the Wellcome Trust, to support policy
development in areas relating to environmental and health challenges and
opportunities in cities. It aims to test the feasibility and methods of
assembling data about the characteristics of a globally distributed sample
of cities, and the populations within them, for comparative analyses, and
to use such data to assess how policies may contribute to sustainable
urban development and human health.

In the 2017 report, indicator 3.5.1 was based on data from the WHO's
Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database (2016 update), the latest version of
which was released in May 2018. This was too late for inclusion in this
year's report.

(the present indicator represents only the levels of air pollution to which
urban populations are exposed).

3.5.2. Sectoral contributions to fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) and its
health impacts

Methods

This indicator quantifies contributions of individual source sectors to
ambient PM2.5 exposure and its health impacts. This year, coal has been
highlighted as a fuel across all sectors.

Data

Estimates of sectoral source contributions to annual mean exposure to
ambient PM2.5 were calculated using the GAINS model (Amann et al.,
2011), which combines bottom-up emission calculations with atmospheric
chemistry and dispersion coefficients.

Energy statistics are taken from the IEA World Energy Outlook 2017 (IEA,
2017), merged with GAINS information on application of emission control
technologies and their emission factors.
Atmospheric transfer coefficients are based on full year simulations with
the EMEP Chemistry Transport Model (Simpson et al. 2012) at 0.5x0.5
resolution using meteorology of 2015 and include a downscaling to capture
sub-grid urban concentration gradients. Calculated ambient PM2.5
concentrations have been validated against in-situ observations from the
latest version of the WHO's Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database (2016
update), and other sources where available (e.g. Chinese statistical
yearbook).
Premature deaths from total ambient PM2.5 for regions other than Europe
are calculated using the methodology of the WHO (2016) assessment on
the burden of disease from ambient air pollution, which relies on disease
specific integrated exposure response relationships (IERs) developed within
the Global Burden of Disease 2013 study (Forouzanfar et al., 2015). Disease
and age specific baseline mortality rates are taken from the GBD Results
database (http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool). For Europe, we
follow the WHO Europe methodology and apply dose-response
relationships for all cause mortality among population over 30 years of age
as reported under the REVIHAAP assessment (WHO, 2013). Details are
described in Kiesewetter et al. (2015).
Attribution of estimated premature deaths from AAP to polluting sectors
was done proportional to the contributions of individual sectors to
population-weighted mean PM2.5 in each country.

Future development
of indicator

The indicator relies on model calculations which are currently
available for a limited set of countries (Europe, South Asia, East Asia)
uncertainty in the shape of integrated exposure-response
relationships (IERs) make the quantification of health burden
inherently uncertain
Different dose-response relationships are used for Europe (REVIHAAP,
recommended by WHO-Europe) and Asia (WHO-Global)
The non-linearity of the IERs used for Asia complicates the translation
between the mortality burden attributed to an individual source,
which is calculated proportional to the source contribution to ambient
PM2.5, and the effect of mitigating this source. While a reduction of
emissions would lead to a (roughly) proportional reduction of ambient
PM2.5, this would not necessarily result in a proportional reduction of
the health burden. In highly polluted environments, the health
benefits of a marginal reduction of emissions would be
disproportionately smaller than the relative change in concentrations.

The spatial coverage is currently being expanded to global coverage. Other
health indicators than premature deaths should be included for a more
complete assessment of the health burden, particularly Years of Life Lost
(YLLs) and Years Lived with Disability (YLDs).
An ideal indicator would provide a marker of benefits for air quality and/or
health that are directly attributable to climate change mitigation action,

which requires scenario analysis. Going beyond coal, a more explicit
quantification of effects of fossil-fuel versus non-fossil fuel based activities
could be undertaken.

Data on city-level GDP for SHUE cities were compiled from various sources,
including the Brookings Institute, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), and World Bank. Where city-level data was unavailable,
regional or national data was used.
Caveats

*
*
*
*
*

Survey data for some cities is up to 10 years old and may not represent
current conditions.
The indicator presents data on only 48 cities, i.e., one fifth of the cities in
SHUE data base.
Data for some cities is likely to be of poor quality (particularly in low
income settings).
Data may not be comparable due to differences in data quality, methods of
data collection, and purpose of survey.
Some parts of the world are under-represented (especially Africa, South
and South-East Asia, and the Middle East).

Future
development
of indicator

The data currently included in this indicator come from an initial scoping of
available data. An ideal indicator would include data from a systematic search of
travel data in all selected cities and countries. This may involve contacting survey
teams in different countries to provide estimates or access to the desired data.
To more fully capture sustainable uptake a future indicator could collate data on
the proportion of total distance travelled made by different modes of transport.
Other data on sustainable travel infrastructure, for instance, the presence of cycle
schemes would be useful.

3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits

Indicator

3.8. Ruminant meat for human consumption

Methods

Total amount of ruminant meat available for consumption (kg/capita/year)
and proportion of energy available from ruminant meat for human
consumption (%) compared to all sources of energy, aggregated by WHO
region from country-specific data over 1990-2013.

Data

Data comes from UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Food
Balance Sheets (FAOSTAT, 2017). The country-specific data was compiled
by the statistics division of the FAO from the national supply and utilization
accounts of primary foods and processed commodities, adding food
imports, subtracting food exports, food fed to animals, and waste/losses
(assumed as 10%), adjusting for changes in food stocks, and dividing
country population (mostly mid-year population estimates).

Caveats

The proposed indicator focuses on reduction of red meat consumption, due
to the high GHG emissions; a lot of the evidence available comes from high-

income countries, rather than from low-middle income, where the
livelihoods and resilience of millions of households are dependent on
livestock, and the livestock production systems are quite different. (For
example, in many arid, pastoralist systems there is no viable agricultural
alternative to keeping livestock.)
Although we used the amount and proportion of energy from ruminant
meat as a proxy indicator for food groups with some of the highest levels of
GHG emissions, it is important to note that emissions are also high for
other food groups, especially from other meat and dairy products. The
graphs below show the proportion of energy available from animal
products and the proportion of protein available from animal products. The
proportion of energy available from animal products is highest in the
Americas, where trends suggest a slight increase, and Europe, where trends
suggest a slight decrease. Proportions are notably low in South East Asia.
Trends suggest proportion of energy from animal products is increasing
most rapidly in the Western Pacific with slower increases apparent in the
Eastern Mediterranean and South East Asia. The proportion of protein
available from animal products follows similar trends to the proportion of
energy from animal products: highest in the Americas and Europe, lowest
in South East Asia, and growing most rapidly in the Western Pacific.
These measures on animal product availability may be useful for tracking
progress on shifting away from animal intensive products to more a more
plant based diets. However, since the evidence relating consumption of
non-red meat and dairy products to adverse health outcomes is currently
less clear than for consumption of red meat, we did not include any
measure of animal product availability in the core indicators.

Future development
of indicator

A comprehensive view of sustainability of livestock production systems in
both developed and developing context is needed, to ensure indicators are
equitable.
Tracking progress towards more sustainable diets requires standardised
and continuous data on food consumption and related GHG emissions
throughout food product life cycles. This would require annual nationally
representative detailed dietary survey data on food consumption.
However, due to the complexity and cost of such data collection, dietary
surveys are available for a limited number of countries and years only.
Efforts to compile data and ensure comparability are underway, but their
current format is not suitable for global monitoring of progress towards
optimal dietary patterns. On the other hand, nearly 800 million suffer from
hunger while 2 billion people are overweight or obese, and while part of
the world overconsumes livestock-derived foods, the poorest populations
consume hardly any. In this indicator we look at the proportion of energy
from meat, but excessive energy consumption needs to be reduced for
good health. Other nutrient requirements need to be met through diverse
diets, including a wide range of food groups, including nutrient-rich foods
such as fruits and vegetables and animal-source foods. These requirements
vary substantially during the life-cycle and are particularly high in growing
young children and pregnant and lactating women. For this reason,
targeting consumption and redistribution rather than promoting
generalized reduction seems a more rational approach.

3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits

Indicator

3.9. Healthcare sector emissions

Methods

This indicator collects data on the MtCO2e attributable to the health care
sector from published reports.

Data source

Data from the UK comes from published reports from the Sustainable
Development Unit (NHS, 2016). Estimates of GHG emissions include
emissions from building energy use, travel to and from sites, and goods
and services purchased from the health care sector.
Data from the US comes from an article by Eckelman & Sherman (2016).
Estimates are modelled using data on health care expenditures.
Data from Australia comes from a published report from the Department
of Health in Victoria (Malik et al.2018). Estimates take into account GHG
associated with products and food purchased by one municipality
(Southern Health), waste, and transportation. To extrapolate to the whole
Victorian Health system estimates from Southern Health were scaled up to
all of Victoria using separations (as a measure of activity) and floor area
(Malik et al, 2018).

Caveats

All sources of data have notable limitations. Estimates from each country
use different calculation methods and include different elements, limiting
comparability. In the UK, there have been changes in the method of
estimating emissions over time. Finally, the indicator does not adjust for
the size (or changes in the size) of the health care system.

The future (ideal)
indicators

A future set of indicators would reflect country-wide GHG emissions of
health care systems with denominators of the system size and volume of
health care service provision. Indicators should be available at each level of
policy and managerial decision-making to inform choices and facilitate
selection of policies and organizational operations with lowest GHG
emission levels.
Additionally, efficiency of health care system performance in relation to
climate change can be evaluated by modelling global health risks
attributed to the GHG emissions of each health care system as a
proportion of their contribution to the health of the population. Mitigation
strategies could be designed in collaboration with relevant sectors, such as
the insurance sector or health care commissioners and providers.

4.1 Economic Losses due to Climate-Related Events
Munch Re NatCatSERVICE provided the data for this indicator. The NatCatSERVICE is
a global database of natural catastrophe data. Munich Re has been systematically
recording information on natural catastrophe loss events from around the world
since 1994. This has developed into one of the world's most comprehensive
databases for information on natural catastrophe loss events. Data suitable for
systematic and analytical evaluation on a worldwide scale are available from 1980
onwards. For this paper, data from 1990 are presented in order to align with the base
year against which GHG emission reduction targets are commonly set.
NatCatSERVICE collect a range of information for around 1,200 events each year. For
this paper only data on direct economic loss (physical/tangible losses, expressed in
US$2017), insured losses (all paid-out insured physical/tangible losses) are used.
Please refer to the online NatCatSERVICE Methodology document, which may be
found
online
(http://natcatservice.munichre.com/assets/pdf/180220_NCS_Methodology_en.pdf)
The Table below illustrates the `peril classification' provided by NatCatSERVICE. Perils
classified as Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological have been included in
the analysis. Geophysical perils are excluded, due to their general independence from

Each natural catastrophe event recorded is assigned a direct economic loss, and
where applicable, an insured loss, expressed in nominal US$ values. Where these are
available, data are taken from official institutions, but where not, estimates are
calculated. The process for estimation depends on what data is available. For
example, if loss estimates from insurance market data is available, this data may be
combined with data on insurance penetration and other event-specific information
to estimate total economic losses. If only low-quality information is available, such as
a description of the number of homes damaged or destroyed, assumptions on value
and costs are made.
Loss values are presented in US$, or if initially expressed in local currency, converted
to US$ using the market exchange rates at the end of the month when the event
occurred. Values for 1990-2016 are converted to US$2016 using country-specific
Consumer Price Indices (CPI), and then inflated to US$2017.
Once data was received from the NatCatSERVICE economic losses (insured and
uninsured) were divided by annual GDP values for each income grouping, sourced
from the World Bank Database and inflated to US$2017 using data sourced from the
US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis. In Watts et al (2017),
2016 GDP data was estimated. For this report, this has been replaced by reported
data.
Data
The data below differs from that reported in Watts et al (2017), as monetary values
have been updated to US$2017, actual rather than estimated GDP data for 2016 is
now used, and absolute losses and fatality data are not reported.

4.2 Investments in zero-carbon energy and energy efficiency
The data for this indicator are sourced from the annual IEA World Energy
Investment publication. Four categories of investment are defined:
Renewables & Nuclear - investment in all renewable and nuclear electricity
generation, and renewable transport and heating (including biofuels and solar
thermal heating)
Energy Efficiency - See below.
Electricity Networks - investment in electricity transmission and distribution
infrastructure.
Fossil Fuels - including oil, gas and coal, upstream mining, drilling and pipeline
infrastructure, and coal, gas and oil power and other energy generation capacity.
For most sectors, `investment' is defined as overnight capital expenditures on new
assets. For some sectors, such as power generation, this investment is attributed to
the year in which a new plant or the upgrade of an existing one becomes
operational. For other sources, such as upstream oil and gas and LNG projects,
where sufficient data are available, investment reflects the capital spending
incurred over time as production from a new source ramps up to maintain output
from an existing asset. For energy efficiency, `investment' is defined as incremental
spending by companies, governments and individuals to acquire equipment that
consumes less energy than that which they would otherwise have bought.
Other areas of expenditure, including operation and maintenance, research and
development, financing costs, mergers and acquisitions or public markets

transactions, are not included. Investment estimates are derived from IEA data for
energy demand, supply and trade, and estimates of unit capacity costs, For more
information, see IEA (2018).i

Bioenergy includes liquid biofuels, soil biomass and biogas. `Other
technologies' includes geothermal energy, small hydropower, concentrated
solar power, municipal and industrial waste, and ocean energy. Fossil fuel
extraction values include direct employment, whereas renewable energy jobs
include direct and indirect employment (e.g. equipment manufacturing),
except for large hydropower (direct employment only).
Due to a change in data collection and estimation methodology, employment
values reported for fossil fuel extraction are substantially higher than those
reported in Watts et al (2017).
Caveats

Future Form of
Indicator

Working Group
Indicator
Methods

Fossil fuel extraction values include direct employment, whereas renewable
energy jobs include direct and indirect employment (e.g. equipment
manufacturing).
An ideal future form of this indicator would track both direct and indirect
employment from the renewables and fossil fuel extraction industries, along
with the geographical distribution in their change over time. This would allow
for an assessment of substitution. However, at present such data is
unavailable, and impractical to collect for the purposes of the Lancet
Countdown alone.

4. Economics and finance
4.5 Funds divested from fossil fuels
The data for this indicator are collected and provided by 350.org.v They
represent the total assets (or assets under management, AUM) for institutions
that have publicly committed to divest in 2017 (for which data is available),
with non-US$ values converted using the market exchange rate when the
commitment was made, and thus do not directly represent the actual sums
divested from fossil fuel companies. A company is committed to `divestment'
if it falls into any of the following five categories:
- `Fossil Free' - An institution or corporation that does not have any
investments (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual funds containing
shares, corporate bonds) in fossil fuel companies (coal, oil, natural gas) and
committed to avoid any fossil fuel investments in the future
- `Full' - An institution or corporation that made a binding commitment to
divest (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual funds containing shares,
corporate bonds) from any fossil fuel company (coal, oil, natural gas).
- `Partial' - An institution or corporation that made a binding commitment to
divest across asset classes from some fossil fuel companies (coal, oil, natural

gas), or to divest from all fossil fuel companies (coal, oil, natural gas), but only
in specific asset classes (e.g. direct investments, domestic equity).
- `Coal and Tar Sands' - An institution or corporation that made a binding
commitment to divest (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual funds
containing shares, corporate bonds) from any coal and tar sands companies.
- `Coal only' - An institution or corporation that made a binding commitment
to divest (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual funds containing
shares, corporate bonds) from any coal companies.
Four organisations that were originally recorded as non-healthcare institutions
have been considered as such for the purpose of this indicator (London School
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, SSM Health, HESTA and HCF). In addition,
the Health Alliance on Climate Change has been removed from the data (as no
explicit divestment commitment has been made).
Data

Caveats
Future Form of
Indicator

Due to confidentiality issues, the full dataset is not available for publication.
However, interested readers may visit the 350.org website for further
information.
See `Methods'.
The ideal future form of this indicator would have two elements. The first
element would track the value of institutional investments in fossil fuels assets,
both in absolute terms and as a proportion of their total portfolios. This would
also allow for tracking of associated funds that are moved out of fossil fuels,
but are not explicitly advertised as `divesting'. However, such data is unlikely
to be available.
The second element of this indicator would more explicitly track the value of
funds divested from fossil fuels by healthcare institutions. The data provided
for the indicator in this paper may be improved upon through, for example,
the issuance of annual surveys either as part of other data collection efforts
from healthcare institutions, or independently.

4.6 - Fossil fuel subsidies
The data for this indicator are taken from the International Energy Agency (IEA),
and is calculated using the price-gap approach, for 42 mostly non-OECD
countries (see data below). The `price-gap' approach is the most commonly
applied methodology for quantifying consumption subsidies. It compares
average end-user prices paid by consumers with reference prices that
correspond to the full cost of supply. The price gap is the amount by which an
end-use price falls short of the reference price and its existence indicates the
presence of a subsidy. Prices are converted to US2017 using data sourced from
the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis. To view the
original data (presented in US$ 2016), please see IEA (2018)vi
Data are presented in US$2017 billion. Data for historic years have altered
compared to the 2017 Countdown publication due to improved information

(including breakdown by fossil fuel for 2009-2011), alongside rebased currency
year.

Fossil fuel production subsidies and consumption subsidies for most OECD
countries are not included, due to the lack of consistent data.
An ideal future form of this indicator would have two key elements. The first
element would be the consistent inclusion of production and consumption
subsidies for all countries, available on an annual basis. The second element
would be the use of this data, along with that of carbon pricing data (see
Indicator 4.9), to create a `net carbon price' indicator. The future practicality of
this indicator will depend on the availability of data at the appropriate level of
granularity.

4. Economics and finance
4.7. Coverage and strength of carbon pricing
The World Bank provides the data for this indicator, through the interactive `Carbon
Pricing Dashboard'.viii Prices are those as of 1st August 2016, 1st December 2017, and
1st April 2018, respectively. For 2018, the indicator includes only instruments that
had been introduced by 1st April 2018. Baseline-and-credit systems are excluded
from the analysis. GHG coverage data is presented as a proportion of 2012 global
anthropogenic GHG emissions (53, 937 MTCO2e) as calculated by EDGAR (Emissions
Database for Global Atmospheric Research)ix. Monetary values are presented in US$,
in current prices.
Note: see Watts et al (2017) for 2016 data.

Instrument coverage of GHG emissions, in both absolute and proportional term, are
based on total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2012 - the last year in which
consistent data was available. `Baseline and Credit' instruments are not included
due to a lack of price data. Some instruments experience an overlap in coverage.
For example, the UK Carbon Price Floor applies to the power sector in the UK,
which is also subject to carbon pricing under the EU ETS. Other instruments
experience partial overlap. As such, total emissions coverage is likely to be
overestimated (ceteris paribus), although this effect is likely to be minor (<2.5%
total coverage). The price used to calculate the weighted average prices are the

prevailing prices on a single day. The prices for many instruments (particularly ETS
instruments) are likely to alter over the course of a year, however the effect on the
final summary values is likely to be minor. Prices are presented in current values.

4.8 - Use of carbon pricing revenues
Data on revenue generated is provided by the World Bank's interactive `Carbon
Pricing Dashboard'.x
The method of revenue expenditure classification is adapted from Carl and Fedor
(2016)xi. Definitions and assumptions regarding the categories as applied in this
paper are as follows:

Climate Change Mitigation - revenues are explicitly allocated to activities or
infrastructure that seeks to reduce, or enable the reduction, of greenhouse gas
emissions, from any source, within or outside of the sectors or jurisdiction in which
the carbon price is applied.
Climate Change Adaptation - as above, but for adaptation activities or
infrastructure.
Revenue Recycling - revenues are explicitly returned to some broad portion of the
population through individual or business tax rate cuts, tax eliminations, or rebates
in order to achieve broad revenue neutrality. Revenue returned to directly
compensate for the cost of GHG emissions (through free permit allocation or
targeted assistance for energy-intensive, trade-exposed firms) are not included).
General Funds - revenues are explicitly used for purposes other than those
described above, or the use of revenues is unspecified or information is unavailable.
Only revenue that may be considered government income is included. For example,
revenue generated by sale of permits issued to utilities under the Californian cap
and trade instrument, which much then be used to finance discounts on household
energy bills through `carbon credits', are not considered, as this revenue does not
pass through the State government. Instruments for which price data is not
available, either due to the type of instrument or simply lack of data, are not
included.
Other assumptions as applied to individual instruments are described below.

5.1 Media coverage of health and climate change
Global newspaper reporting on health and climate change
Coverage of climate change and public health tracks consistently with
several trends in media coverage of climate change or global warming,
where political, scientific, cultural and ecological/meteorological themes
provide news hooks for stories over time. For example, the increase in
coverage in late 2009 is associated with news regarding the United Nations
Conference of Parties climate change negotiations.
Media serve as critical inputs for public discourse on contemporary climate
challenges. Consequently, it is important to conduct methodologically
consistent and high-quality monitoring and aggregation of media
treatments to help understand public discourse on climate change and
health over the past eleven years. Through this monitoring, we have found
that there is room for further increases in the quantity of public health and
climate change media coverage in various WHO regions. Going forward, it
would be of interest to conduct further research to understand why
coverage of climate change and health is significantly higher in SE Asia than
in other regions. This could, in turn, foster ongoing and vital discussions of
these links for everyday people around the world.
The 2018 work here expanded analyses through 2017 and added forty-four
sources. In 2018, we monitored climate change coverage across sixty-two
sources (in English, Spanish, Portuguese and German) in thirty-six countries
covering regions around the world over an eleven-year period, from
January 2007 through December 2017. Therefore, this work provides a
more robust assessment of climate change/global warming and public
health indicators than before. These sources have been selected through a
decision processes involving weighting of four main factors: (1)
geographical diversity (favouring a greater geographical range), (2)
circulation (favouring higher circulating publications), (3) national sources
(rather than local/regional), and (4) reliable access to archives over time
(favouring those accessible consistently for longer periods). While this
improved methodology does provide a more robust sample of sources, due
to the change in methodologies across 2017 and 2018, it is not possible to
compare these analyses in real terms. However, it remains possible to
examine relative trends.

Findings from 62 sources in 36 countries around the world over an elevenyear period, from January 2007 through December 2017.
Findings from these searches must be interpreted with some caution.
Prominently, with this extensive Boolean string, there are some returns that
do not centrally address climate change and health together. For example,
the search term "temperature" often generates a hit, but articles may be
addressing a fever related to some illness, rather than climate change or
global warming. As another example, there may be some overlap between
articles discussing climate change legislation and health care legislation
respectively without meaningfully linking climate change and health. Also,
in working with newspapers, rather than, for example, UN
communications/documents, a narrower or more tailored approach might
more effectively reduce the possibilities for false positives in the dataset.
While we find that these shortcomings garner some caution, we do not

think that they are significant enough to need changes and we find this to
be the most effective approach given the tools available.

5: Public and political engagement
5.1.2: In-depth analysis of newspaper coverage on health and climate
change
In 2018, this indicator analyses the trends in media coverage of the climate
change and health nexus, in three selected national newspapers, from
January 2009 to December 2017. Although some tabloids have a broader
readership, Le Monde, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and The New York
Times continue to set the tone of public debates, and therefore are a good
prism through which the perceptions of these issues in society can be
analysed. In order to not only find articles which would give valuable
information about the topic of climate and health but also to evaluate this
information most efficiently, we used a combination of quantitative and
qualitative methods.
Articles from the newspapers were searched in online search databases (Le
Monde, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung) and in Factiva (The New York
Times) using specific search syntax to track the number of articles on climate
change and health each year. Articles were then screened, identified and
categorized according to specified criteria (type of article, author's profession,
type of source, tone of the article, studied health impact, geographical focus,
context, recommendation, targeted audience).
In the work for the 2017 publication, analysis had already been completed for
two of the newspapers, Le Monde and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,
for the time period 2007-2016. For the 2018 Countdown report, we have
expanded the time period to 2007-2017 and, in addition, added a third
newspaper, The New York Times, to our analysis. This addition is in
recognition of the relevance of the USA to the global climate change picture
(recent withdrawal of the USA from the Paris Agreement, major contribution
to GHG emissions globally and frequency of extreme climatic event such as
wildfires and hurricanes).
In addition, for the 2018 Countdown report, we provide a comparison of two
trends: the media coverage of "health and climate change", using our specific
search syntax and screening process, and the media coverage of "climate
change", without screening process. This allowed us to calculate a ratio of
articles mentioning the link with health among articles about climate change.
We provide the following table to show how we adapted the French &
German search terms used for the 2017 report to English:

For consistency and feasibility reasons, we maintained approximately the
same search terms in the 2018 Countdown report as we used for the 2017
publication. We did not find any significant problems with them. That said,
findings from these searches had to be screened carefully. Prominently, with
this extensive Boolean string, there were some returns that did not centrally
address climate change and health together (false positives). For example,
there may be some overlap between articles discussing climate change
legislation and health care legislation respectively without meaningfully
linking climate change and health. We tackled this issue by a high-quality
screening of all positive results, in order to identify and analyse only relevant
articles.
Since different researchers handled the analysis of the different newspapers,
we also address a certain number of potential biases and shortcomings by
limiting the comparison of absolute numbers. Rather, we compare trends.
Moreover, we provide here the detail of the screening process. The articles
were identified if one or more of the following criteria were met: the article
stated a link between health and climate change; explained the link between
health and climate change; or attributed a climatic event to climate change
and linking this climatic event to health impacts. In all cases, health refers to
one of the health terms mentioned in the table above, the health impact
being either positive or negative. Also, all articles do not establish a definite
link between health and climate change: some only mention a potential or
possible link.
Context of publication
Despite the fact that articles are mostly clustered around international
political events, great attention also seems to be given to the release of
scientific reports or publications, as well as various other events, marking the
broadening of "media windows" and ensuring more regular publications on
the issue of health and climate change. For example, in Le Monde, many
`tribunes' (pages provided by newspapers in which points of view can be
expressed by the public) demonstrate commitment from various
communities (researchers, Nobel prices, business leaders); more space is also
dedicated to articles presenting one specific impact on health (for example

mental health and extreme climate events or coccidioidomycosis and climate
change in Le Monde).
Geographical range of reference
Although global events are covered in all three newspapers, articles in 2017
still focused mostly on national contexts (58% of articles focusing on the US
for The New York Times, 30% focusing on France for Le Monde, and 11%
focusing on Germany for the FAZ).

5.2: Coverage of health and climate change in scientific journals
We tracked the use of climate-related terms and their co-occurrence with health
terms using a bibliometric search in both PubMed and Web of Science databases.
The search terms were the following and adapted according to the database:
Climate change related terms

This list of search terms were found to be exhaustive and appropriate for scientific
databases. A more detailed search syntax, including the diseases of poverty used
by indicator 5.3 was not necessary as with the use of medical subject headings
(MeSH-Terms) for instance in PubMed those diseases are covered through the
MeSH Term "Communicable diseases". Different search syntaxes were applied and
the final number of overall publications did not show to vary significantly
underlining that the search strategy was robust and able to capture most relevant
articles.
Titles and abstracts of identified papers for relevance to the topic were screened
three times. The results were then merged using the Endnote reference manager
software and duplicates removed. Conflicts were resolved within the research
team and a final selection of articles were prepared for analysis. The stepwise
process of the selection of articles is presented in the flow chart below.

Numbers indicate the article count retained at each step of the process. With the
applied search terms more than 9000 scientific articles on climate change and
health were identified for the period of 2007-2017. After the screening process only
25,8% (n=2547) were retained and found to be relevant. Indeed, a majority just
mentioned climate change in the abstract and did not focus on the link between
climate change and health. Other articles explored ecological health or animal
health but not human health and were therefore excluded. A minority of papers

Data

Other results

were excluded as these were book chapters or conference proceedings referenced
in both databases.
After the screening process, data was extracted, categorized and coded to allow for
statistical analysis of the results.
Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied in order to capture the most
relevant literature. Only peer-reviewed scientific articles on climate change and
population health in English were included. This means that all articles including
original quantitative and qualitative studies, reviews, editorials, viewpoints or
comments are covered in this indicator. Also, no restriction to country or
population was applied.
Moreover, articles that mention climate-related or health-related terms in titles
or abstracts but did not have a specific focus or direct link between climate
change and health were excluded.
Geographical coverage
Geographically, the majority of publications address the impact of climate change
and health in Europe, the Americas and the Western Pacific Region. Except for the
region the Americas, all other regions did not show a significantly increase in the
number of scientific publications in 2017.

For comparison, we also display the total number of scientific publications on

Future Form
of Indicator

This indicator only used two databases, which may be a limitation even though
both databases are complementary and cover together the majority of the
scientific publications in the area of climate change and human health. Moreover,
grey literature is not captured in this indicator and may bias the results. The
restriction to publications in English language only may be a caveat. Also the
number of scientific publications on climate change in general were not screened
manually for relevance due to their volume. Finally, the quality of identified
scientific publications are not assessed and analysis was conducted using the title
and abstract of articles due to the restrictions in locating full texts for the large
volume of articles included.
This indicator aims to provide a mapping of existing scientific publications in the
area of climate change and health. It will offer a better understanding of the
research gaps and trends as well as researchers engagements on this crucial issue
over time.
The search syntax can be used each year to track the number of scientific articles
on climate change and health. In the future, each identified scientific publication
will be categorized according to different criteria (geographical focus, type of
article, health outcome, type of climate change measurement, etc.) in order to
provide more details over time on the research trends and engagements.
Other contents, such as the growth trend of this field, the productive institutions,
countries that contribute to those papers, citations and cooperations could also be
analyzed in the future.

5.3 Engagement in health and climate change in the United Nations General
Assembly
In order to produce the measure of high level political engagement with climate
change and health in the UN General Assembly, we use a new dataset of UN
General Debate statements, which we discuss below. Our approach to using GD
statements to produce the indicators is based on the application of natural
language processing to the corpus of GD statements. We identify references to
key search terms linked to (a) health, and (b) climate change (table 2).

In order to produce an indicator of engagement with the intersection of
climate change and health, we focused on whether any of the climate change
related terms appeared immediately before or after any health terms in the
GD statements. This was based on a search of the 25 words before and after a
reference to a climate change related term. The choice of 25-word window
context corresponds to approximately half a paragraph of text. Given that GD
statements are highly structured and methodically developed by governments
over prolonged periods of time, we assume that half a paragraph of text
around public health terms captures a sufficiently narrow context. We then
search and count the number of climate change term references in these
contexts to produce the measure of engagement with the link between health
and climate change. We conducted a robustness analysis by varying the size of
the context (5, 10, and 50 words). This substantively produced the same
trends over time. We also further examined a sample of the references
produced by the search as an additional check to ensure that the references
identified reflect engagement with the health impacts of climate change.
To produce this indicator, we draw on a new and updated dataset of GD
statements: the United Nations General Debate corpus, in which the annual GD
statements have been pre-processed and prepared for the application of
natural language processing to the official English versions of the statements.1
The dataset contains all of the country speeches made in the UN General
Debate between 1970 and 2017. Table X0 presents summary of the data by
year.

The data was pre-processed for analysis by removing punctuation, symbols,
numbers, and URLs. We also removed any tokens smaller than three characters
to reduce typos and mistakes from the document digitisation process. In
addition, all tokens were normalised (lowercased). All pre-processing and
analysis was carried out in R using "quanteda" package.1
Caveats

The search for climate change terms in the context of public health references
is a proxy for the semantic linkage between the two sets of terms in GD
statements. This approach produces a scalable and reproducible measure with
a high degree of reliability that does not involve human judgement or subjective
biases. However, there may be examples of governments referring to climate
change and health but not the direct linkages between the two, which are
included in the count; and there may be examples of governments discussing
the health impacts of climate change in their GD statements, which are not
included in our measure because the distance between the mention of the
climate change term and the health term exceeds 25 words. Based on an
analysing a sample of the speeches and references, such cases are rare and do
not have a significant bearing on the indicator or the trends uncovered.
It is also worth noting that the analysis here is based on a narrow range of search
terms, which excludes reference to many of indirect links between climate
change and health. A number of GD statements in this time period refer to such
indirect connections, such as the effects of climate change on water and
agriculture - however, these are not included here. Therefore, the results
present a somewhat conservative estimate of high level political engagement
with the intersection of climate change and health. Future work in this area will
consider engagement with these indirect links.

Future Form of
Indicator

In the future, we plan on looking more closely at the references to indirect
links between climate change and health. For example, what are the main
ways in which governments view climate change impacting on health? We will
consider whether this changes over time based on awareness of the multiple
ways in which climate change and health are connected.
We will also look to expand this indicator by considering private sector
engagement with climate change and health. Specifically, for next iteration of
the indicator we will examine annual corporate social responsibility and

sustainability reports ("Triple Bottom Line Reports") of major international
corporations. Using these report, we will perform similar searches
(engagement with health, climate change, and intersection of the two) based
on these reports.
We present some additional findings and breakdowns in this section. Figure 1
below presents the proportion of countries that engage with the intersection of
climate change and health by WHO region. It is worth noting that the relatively
higher level of political engagement by countries in the Western Pacific is
especially driven by the small island development states (SIDS) in this region. It
also worth noting that North America WHO region contains only two countries,
USA and Canada. As neither of these countries refer to the health impacts of
climate change (the US statement made no reference to climate change), the
North America region has zero proportion of countries engaged with the climate
change-health links.

Figure 4 below shows the level of political engagement with climate change and

change and health. This is measured by the references to the key search terms
associated with climate change and health in General Debate speeches. Figure
5 shows the proportion of countries that refer to public health in their GD
statements between 1970 and 2017, while Figure 6 shows the proportion of
countries that make a reference to climate change during this period. The
figures show that in general there is higher levels of engagement with climate

change than health. Figures 4 and 6 also show a sharp increase in engagement
with climate change in the General Debate around 2006, followed by a decline
in 2009 after the COP 15 in Copenhagen that year. However, there has been an
increase in engagement with climate change in recent years around the Paris
Agreement. Engagement with health has in comparison been lower. However,
there has broadly been increasing engagement with public health during this
time period, and a sharp increase in 2000 with the launch of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). There is also an increase in the salience of global
health from 2012 onwards, which coincides with the transition from the MDGs
to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Figure 7 below presents a world map, which shows the countries that refer to

low level of engagement with the health impacts of climate change around the
world in 2017. However, due to their size the SIDS do not show up on the map.
As we have noted, the SIDS tend to be highly represented among nations
engaging with the health-climate change links.
Figures 8 and 9 present world maps, which show the countries that refer to
public health and climate change respectively in their 2017 GD statements, as
well as indicating the number of references made by each country. The figures
demonstrate that while there is relatively low engagement with the intersection
of health and climate change, there is considerable engagement with the issues
of climate change and health separately. Figures 8 and 9 show that as well as a
much larger share of countries around the world discussing climate change and
health in their GD statements compared to those discussing the intersection,
there is also much deeper engagement with these two areas individually, in that
countries tend to make a number of references to climate change and health in
their GD statements.

In order to produce an indicator of engagement with the intersection of climate
change and health, we focused on whether any of the climate change related terms
appeared immediately before or after any public health terms in the COP reports.
This was based on a search of the 25 words before and after a reference to a public
health related term. Table X0 presents total number of references identified in COP
reports per year, where the column "Intersection" is the count of climate change
terms appearing in the context (25 words before and after) of health terms.

For the development of our indicator we focused only on the reports available in
English (16,290), or around 48 per cent of the total number of UN Global Compact COP
reports. A number of the English language files were corrupt or could not be converted
into plain text format for analysis. The distribution of available English-language
reports over time is presented in Table 8.

There are only single COP report submissions before 2011, thus we limit the sample of
COP reports to the period 2011-2017, and the final sample of 15,220 documents. We
pre-processed and prepared these documents for the application of natural language
processing by converting the reports to plain text format; removing punctuation and
numbers; removing stopwords; regularising (lowercasing); and stemming. All of the
preprocessing was conducted using the Python NLTK toolkit.
Caveats

As noted above, we have only considered COP reports that were submitted in English.
This means we have analysed just under half of all available UN General Compact COP
reports.

This analysis here is based on a narrow range of search terms, which excludes
reference to many of indirect links between climate change and health. Reports may
also discuss indirect connections, such as the effect of climate change on agriculture,
however, these are not included here. Therefore, the results present a somewhat
conservative estimate of high corporate engagement with the intersection of climate
change and health. Future work in this area will consider engagement with these
indirect links, as well as providing additional forms of analysis.
In the future, we aim to increase the number of reports we analyse by translating our
key search terms into several other key languages, and incorporating reports
submitted in languages other than English into our sample. Translation of key terms
has been implemented in WG5 into Spanish, Portuguese, and German. We plan to
expand our analysis using these translations for next year's report.
We present some additional findings and breakdowns in this section. Figure 11 below
presents the levels of corporate engagement with the intersection of climate change
and health by WHO region. The graphs shows the proportion of companies based in
the different WHO regions that refer to the health impacts of climate change in their
annual COP report. As noted in the main report, we see the highest engagement from
companies based in the Western Pacific and North America. In contrast, the lowest
engagement is from companies based in the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean
regions.

health and climate change in COP reports, 2011-2017.

Figure 11. Proportion of companies referring to intersection of health and climate
change by region, 2011-2014.

Figure 12 below shows the total number of references to the health impacts of climate
change in companies UN General Compact COP reports between 2011 and 2017. The
graph shows an increase in the number of mentions of the intersection of health and
climate change during this period. This is likely to be in part driven by the increased
number of COP reports submitted during this time. However, there is also an increase
in engagement between 2014 and 2017 irrespective of the increased number of
reports submitted.

Figure 12. Total number of references to the intersection of health and climate change
in COP reports, 2011-2017.

Figure 13 below shows the total number of references to public health and climate
change (separately) in COP reports between 2011 and 2017. The graph shows that
references to health-related issues in the COP reports tends to be higher than climate
change issues, and that references to both are much higher than references to the
intersection of health and climate change. The graph also shows an increase in
references to both health and climate change. However, this is likely to be driven by
the increase in the number of reports submitted during this period.

Figure 13. Total number of references to public health and climate change in COP
reports, 2011-2017.

Figure 14 below shows the proportion of COP reports across the entire time period
(2011-2017) the make reference to the health impacts of climate change (and climate
change and health separately) by the sector in which the company operates. It is worth
noting that the sector categories have been determined by the UN Global Compact.
There are some significant differences in engagement with the health impacts of

climate change by sector. The highest engagement comes from companies based in
telecommunications where over 40 per cent of COP reports make reference to the
intersection of climate change and health.

Figure 14. Proportion of companies referring to intersection of health and climate
change by sector, 2011-2014.

Figure 15 below presents a world map showing the proportion of companies in
different countries that engage with the intersection of climate change and health in
their 2017 COP reports. The map shows the relatively low level of engagement with
the health impacts of climate change around the world in 2017. The map shows the
relatively high level of engagement with climate change-health linkages in the Western
Pacific and North America. The map also shows particularly high levels of engagement
in Russia and Central Asia, and Saudi Arabia, although this is in part due to fewer
companies based in the regions being signed up to the UN Global Compact, and
submitting reports in English.
Figures 16 and 17 present world maps that show the proportion of companies in
different countries that refer to public health and climate change respectively in their
2017 COP reports. The maps show that there is typically more engagement with health
and climate change (separately) than with the intersection of the two. Broadlyspeaking, the maps show similar country trends to Figure 15. However, there is
significantly higher corporate engagement with health across Asia and Africa than
there is with climate change or the intersection of the two.
