"Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis" presents clear and robust conclusions in a global assessment of climate change science-- not the least of which is that the science now shows with 95 percent certainty that human activity is the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century. The report confirms that warming in the climate system is unequivocal, with many of the observed changes unprecedented over decades to millennia: warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, diminishing snow and ice, rising sea levels and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850.	0
The Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report  considers new evidence of climate change based on many independent scientific analyses from observations of the climate system, paleoclimate archives, theoretical studies of climate processes and simulations using climate models. It builds upon the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report , and incorporates subsequent new findings of research. As a component of the fifth assessment cycle, the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation  is an important basis for information on changing weather and climate extremes.	0
This Summary for Policymakers  follows the structure of the Working Group I report. The narrative is supported by a series of overarching highlighted conclusions which, taken together, provide a concise summary. Main sections are introduced with a brief paragraph in italics which outlines the methodological basis of the assessment. The degree of certainty in key findings in this assessment is based on the author teams' evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confidence  and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood . Confidence in the validity of a finding is based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence  and the degree of agreement1. Probabilistic estimates of quantified measures of uncertainty in a finding are based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgment2. Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers. . The basis for substantive paragraphs in this Summary for Policymakers can be found in the chapter sections of the underlying report and in the Technical Summary. These references are given in curly brackets.	0
In this Summary for Policymakers, the following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium, or high. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high, and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. For a given evidence and agreement statement, different confidence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing confidence .	0
Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950 . It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale6. It is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. There are likely more land regions where the number of heavy precipitation events has increased than where it has decreased. The frequency or intensity of heavy precipitation events has likely increased in North America and Europe. In other continents, confidence in changes in heavy precipitation events is at most medium. 	0

* The direct comparison of assessment findings between reports is difficult. For some climate variables, different aspects have been assessed, and the revised guidance note on uncertainties has been used for the SREX and AR5. The availability of new information, improved scientific understanding, continued analyses of data and models, and specific differences in methodologies applied in the assessed studies, all contribute to revised assessment findings. Notes: a Attribution is based on available case studies. It is likely that human influence has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of some observed heat waves in some locations. b Models project near-term increases in the duration, intensity and spatial extent of heat waves and warm spells. c In most continents, confidence in trends is not higher than medium except in North America and Europe where there have been likely increases in either the frequency or intensity of heavy precipitation with some seasonal and/or regional variation. It is very likely that there have been increases in central North America. d The frequency and intensity of drought has likely increased in the Mediterranean and West Africa, and likely decreased in central North America and north-west Australia. e AR4 assessed the area affected by drought. f SREX assessed medium confidence that anthropogenic influence had contributed to some changes in the drought patterns observed in the second half of the 20th century, based on its attributed impact on precipitation and temperature changes. SREX assessed low confidence in the attribution of changes in droughts at the level of single regions. g There is low confidence in projected changes in soil moisture. h Regional to global-scale projected decreases in soil moisture and increased agricultural drought are likely  in presently dry regions by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Soil moisture drying in the Mediterranean, Southwest US and southern African regions is consistent with projected changes in Hadley circulation and increased surface temperatures, so there is high confidence in likely surface drying in these regions by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. i There is medium confidence that a reduction in aerosol forcing over the North Atlantic has contributed at least in part to the observed increase in tropical cyclone activity since the 1970s in this region. j Based on expert judgment and assessment of projections which use an SRES A1B  scenario. k Attribution is based on the close relationship between observed changes in extreme and mean sea level. l There is high confidence that this increase in extreme high sea level will primarily be the result of an increase in mean sea level. There is low confidence in region-specific projections of storminess and associated storm surges. m SREX assessed it to be very likely that mean sea level rise will contribute to future upward trends in extreme coastal high water levels.	0
The annual mean Arctic sea ice extent decreased over the period 1979 to 2012 with a rate that was very likely in the range 3.5 to 4.1% per decade , and very likely in the range 9.4 to 13.6% per decade  for the summer sea ice minimum . The average decrease in decadal mean extent of Arctic sea ice has been most rapid in summer ; the spatial extent has decreased in every season, and in every successive decade since 1979  . There is medium confidence from reconstructions that over the past three decades, Arctic summer sea ice retreat was unprecedented and sea surface temperatures were anomalously high in at least the last 1,450 years. 	0

All time-series  show annual values, and where assessed, uncertainties are indicated by coloured shading. See Technical Summary Supplementary Material for a listing of the datasets. 	0
Since the early 1970s, glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion from warming together explain about 75% of the observed global mean sea level rise . Over the period 1993 to 2010, global mean sea level rise is, with high confidence, consistent with the sum of the observed contributions from ocean thermal expansion due to warming  mm yr-1), from changes in glaciers  mm yr-1), Greenland ice sheet  mm yr-1), Antarctic ice sheet  mm yr-1), and land water storage  mm yr-1). The sum of these contributions is 2.8  mm yr-1. 	0
There is very high confidence that maximum global mean sea level during the last interglacial period  was, for several thousand years, at least 5 m higher than present, and high confidence that it did not exceed 10 m above present. During the last interglacial period, the Greenland ice sheet very likely contributed between 1.4 and 4.3 m to the higher global mean sea level, implying with medium confidence an additional contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet. This change in sea level occurred in the context of different orbital forcing and with high-latitude surface temperature, averaged over several thousand years, at least 2C warmer than present . 	0
Natural and anthropogenic substances and processes that alter the Earth's energy budget are drivers of climate change. Radiative forcing14  quantifies the change in energy fluxes caused by changes in these drivers for 2011 relative to 1750, unless otherwise indicated. Positive RF leads to surface warming, negative RF leads to surface cooling. RF is estimated based on in-situ and remote observations, properties of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and calculations using numerical models representing observed processes. Some emitted compounds affect the atmospheric concentration of other substances. The RF can be reported based on the concentration changes of each substance15. Alternatively, the emission-based RF of a compound can be reported, which provides a more direct link to human activities. It includes contributions from all substances affected by that emission. The total anthropogenic RF of the two approaches are identical when considering all drivers. Though both approaches are used in this Summary for Policymakers, emission-based RFs are emphasized.	0
The strength of drivers is quantified as Radiative Forcing  in units watts per square metre  as in previous IPCC assessments. RF is the change in energy flux caused by a driver, and is calculated at the tropopause or at the top of the atmosphere. In the traditional RF concept employed in previous IPCC reports all surface and tropospheric conditions are kept fixed. In calculations of RF for well-mixed greenhouse gases and aerosols in this report, physical variables, except for the ocean and sea ice, are allowed to respond to perturbations with rapid adjustments. The resulting forcing is called Effective Radiative Forcing  in the underlying report. This change reflects the scientific progress from previous assessments and results in a better indication of the eventual temperature response for these drivers. For all drivers other than well-mixed greenhouse gases and aerosols, rapid adjustments are less well characterized and assumed to be small, and thus the traditional RF is used. 	0
Figure SPM.5 | Radiative forcing estimates in 2011 relative to 1750 and aggregated uncertainties for the main drivers of climate change. Values are global average radiative forcing , partitioned according to the emitted compounds or processes that result in a combination of drivers. The best estimates of the net radiative forcing are shown as black diamonds with corresponding uncertainty intervals; the numerical values are provided on the right of the figure, together with the confidence level in the net forcing . Albedo forcing due to black carbon on snow and ice is included in the black carbon aerosol bar. Small forcings due to contrails , and HFCs, PFCs and SF6  are not shown. Concentration-based RFs for gases can be obtained by summing the like-coloured bars. Volcanic forcing is not included as its episodic nature makes is difficult to compare to other forcing mechanisms. Total anthropogenic radiative forcing is provided for three different years relative to 1750. For further technical details, including uncertainty ranges associated with individual components and processes, see the Technical Summary Supplementary Material. 	0
The observed reduction in surface warming trend over the period 1998 to 2012 as compared to the period 1951 to 2012, is due in roughly equal measure to a reduced trend in radiative forcing and a cooling contribution from natural internal variability, which includes a possible redistribution of heat within the ocean . The reduced trend in radiative forcing is primarily due to volcanic eruptions and the timing of the downward phase of the 11-year solar cycle. However, there is low confidence in quantifying the role of changes in radiative forcing in causing the reduced warming trend. There is medium confidence that natural internal decadal variability causes to a substantial degree the difference between observations and the simulations; the latter are not expected to reproduce the timing of natural internal variability. There may also be a contribution from forcing inadequacies and, in some models, an overestimate of the response to increasing greenhouse gas and other anthropogenic forcing . 	0
The equilibrium climate sensitivity quantifies the response of the climate system to constant radiative forcing on multicentury time scales. It is defined as the change in global mean surface temperature at equilibrium that is caused by a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 1.5C to 4.5C , extremely unlikely less than 1C , and very unlikely greater than 6C 16. The lower temperature limit of the assessed likely range is thus less than the 2C in the AR4, but the upper limit is the same. This assessment reflects improved understanding, the extended temperature record in the atmosphere and ocean, and new estimates of radiative forcing. 	0
Various metrics can be used to compare the contributions to climate change of emissions of different substances. The most appropriate metric and time horizon will depend on which aspects of climate change are considered most important to a particular application. No single metric can accurately compare all consequences of different emissions, and all have limitations and uncertainties. The Global Warming Potential is based on the cumulative radiative forcing over a particular time horizon, and the Global Temperature Change Potential is based on the change in global mean surface temperature at a chosen point in time. Updated values are provided in the underlying Report. 	0
Greenhouse gases contributed a global mean surface warming likely to be in the range of 0.5C to 1.3C over the period 1951 to 2010, with the contributions from other anthropogenic forcings, including the cooling effect of aerosols, likely to be in the range of -0.6C to 0.1C. The contribution from natural forcings is likely to be in the range of -0.1C to 0.1C, and from natural internal variability is likely to be in the range of -0.1C to 0.1C. Together these assessed contributions are consistent with the observed warming of approximately 0.6C to 0.7C over this period. 	0
Figure SPM.6 | Comparison of observed and simulated climate change based on three large-scale indicators in the atmosphere, the cryosphere and the ocean: change in continental land surface air temperatures , Arctic and Antarctic September sea ice extent , and upper ocean heat content in the major ocean basins . Global average changes are also given. Anomalies are given relative to 1880-1919 for surface temperatures, 1960-1980 for ocean heat content and 1979-1999 for sea ice. All time-series are decadal averages, plotted at the centre of the decade. For temperature panels, observations are dashed lines if the spatial coverage of areas being examined is below 50%. For ocean heat content and sea ice panels the solid line is where the coverage of data is good and higher in quality, and the dashed line is where the data coverage is only adequate, and thus, uncertainty is larger. Model results shown are Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  multi-model ensemble ranges, with shaded bands indicating the 5 to 95% confidence intervals.

Projections of changes in the climate system are made using a hierarchy of climate models ranging from simple climate models, to models of intermediate complexity, to comprehensive climate models, and Earth System Models. These models simulate changes based on a set of scenarios of anthropogenic forcings. A new set of scenarios, the Representative Concentration Pathways , was used for the new climate model simulations carried out under the framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  of the World Climate Research Programme. In all RCPs, atmospheric CO2 concentrations are higher in 2100 relative to present day as a result of a further increase of cumulative emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere during the 21st century . Projections in this Summary for Policymakers are for the end of the 21st century  given relative to 1986-2005, unless otherwise stated. To place such projections in historical context, it is necessary to consider observed changes between different periods. Based on the longest global surface temperature dataset available, the observed change between the average of the period 1850-1900 and of the AR5 reference period is 0.61  C. However, warming has occurred beyond the average of the AR5 reference period. Hence this is not an estimate of historical warming to present  .	0
Projected climate change based on RCPs is similar to AR4 in both patterns and magnitude, after accounting for scenario differences. The overall spread of projections for the high RCPs is narrower than for comparable scenarios used in AR4 because in contrast to the SRES emission scenarios used in AR4, the RCPs used in AR5 are defined as concentration pathways and thus carbon cycle uncertainties affecting atmospheric CO2 concentrations are not considered in the concentration-driven CMIP5 simulations. Projections of sea level rise are larger than in the AR4, primarily because of improved modelling of land-ice contributions. 	0

Based on the CMIP5 ensemble; anomalies calculated with respect to 1986-2005. Using HadCRUT4 and its uncertainty estimate , the observed warming to the reference period 1986-2005 is 0.61  C from 1850-1900, and 0.11  C from 1980-1999, the reference period for projections used in AR4. Likely ranges have not been assessed here with respect to earlier reference periods because methods are not generally available in the literature for combining the uncertainties in models and observations. Adding projected and observed changes does not account for potential effects of model biases compared to observations, and for natural internal variability during the observational reference period 	0
Based on 21 CMIP5 models; anomalies calculated with respect to 1986-2005. Where CMIP5 results were not available for a particular AOGCM and scenario, they were estimated as explained in Chapter 13, Table 13.5. The contributions from ice sheet rapid dynamical change and anthropogenic land water storage are treated as having uniform probability distributions, and as largely independent of scenario. This treatment does not imply that the contributions concerned will not depend on the scenario followed, only that the current state of knowledge does not permit a quantitative assessment of the dependence. Based on current understanding, only the collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause global mean sea level to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. There is medium confidence that this additional contribution would not exceed several tenths of a meter of sea level rise during the 21st century.	0
Calculated from projections as 5-95% model ranges. These ranges are then assessed to be likely ranges after accounting for additional uncertainties or different levels of confidence in models. For projections of global mean surface temperature change in 2046-2065 confidence is medium, because the relative importance of natural internal variability, and uncertainty in non-greenhouse gas forcing and response, are larger than for 2081-2100. The likely ranges for 2046-2065 do not take into account the possible influence of factors that lead to the assessed range for near-term  global mean surface temperature change that is lower than the 5-95% model range, because the influence of these factors on longer term projections has not been quantified due to insufficient scientific understanding. 	0
In the RCP projections, thermal expansion accounts for 30 to 55% of 21st century global mean sea level rise, and glaciers for 15 to 35%. The increase in surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet will exceed the increase in snowfall, leading to a positive contribution from changes in surface mass balance to future sea level . While surface melting will remain small, an increase in snowfall on the Antarctic ice sheet is expected , resulting in a negative contribution to future sea level from changes in surface mass balance. Changes in outflow from both ice sheets combined will likely make a contribution in the range of 0.03 to 0.20 m by 2081-2100 . 	0
Limiting the warming caused by anthropogenic CO2 emissions alone with a probability of >33%, >50%, and >66% to less than 2C since the period 1861-188022, will require cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources to stay between 0 and about 1570 GtC , 0 and about 1210 GtC , and 0 and about 1000 GtC  since that period, respectively23. These upper amounts are reduced to about 900 GtC , 820 GtC , and 790 GtC , respectively, when accounting for non-CO2 forcings as in RCP2.6. An amount of 515  GtC  GtCO2), was already emitted by 2011. 	0
A large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial time scale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period. Surface temperatures will remain approximately constant at elevated levels for many centuries after a complete cessation of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Due to the long time scales of heat transfer from the ocean surface to depth, ocean warming will continue for centuries. Depending on the scenario, about 15 to 40% of emitted CO2 will remain in the atmosphere longer than 1,000 years. 	0
It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue beyond 2100, with sea level rise due to thermal expansion to continue for many centuries. The few available model results that go beyond 2100 indicate global mean sea level rise above the pre-industrial level by 2300 to be less than 1 m for a radiative forcing that corresponds to CO2 concentrations that peak and decline and remain below 500 ppm, as in the scenario RCP2.6. For a radiative forcing that corresponds to a CO2 concentration that is above 700 ppm but below 1500 ppm, as in the scenario RCP8.5, the projected rise is 1 m to more than 3 m . 	0
Figure SPM.10 | Global mean surface temperature increase as a function of cumulative total global CO2 emissions from various lines of evidence. Multimodel results from a hierarchy of climate-carbon cycle models for each RCP until 2100 are shown with coloured lines and decadal means . Some decadal means are labeled for clarity . Model results over the historical period  are indicated in black. The coloured plume illustrates the multi-model spread over the four RCP scenarios and fades with the decreasing number of available models in RCP8.5. The multi-model mean and range simulated by CMIP5 models, forced by a CO2 increase of 1% per year , is given by the thin black line and grey area. For a specific amount of cumulative CO2 emissions, the 1% per year CO2 simulations exhibit lower warming than those driven by RCPs, which include additional non-CO2 forcings. Temperature values are given relative to the 1861-1880 base period, emissions relative to 1870. Decadal averages are connected by straight lines. For further technical details see the Technical Summary Supplementary Material. 	0
Sustained mass loss by ice sheets would cause larger sea level rise, and some part of the mass loss might be irreversible. There is high confidence that sustained warming greater than some threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a global mean sea level rise of up to 7 m. Current estimates indicate that the threshold is greater than about 1C  but less than about 4C  global mean warming with respect to pre-industrial. Abrupt and irreversible ice loss from a potential instability of marinebased sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to climate forcing is possible, but current evidence and understanding is insufficient to make a quantitative assessment. 	0
Methods that aim to deliberately alter the climate system to counter climate change, termed geoengineering, have been proposed. Limited evidence precludes a comprehensive quantitative assessment of both Solar Radiation Management  and Carbon D ioxide Removal  and their impact on the climate system. CDR methods have biogeochemical and technological limitations to their potential on a global scale. There is insufficient knowledge to quantify how much CO2 emissions could be partially offset by CDR on a century timescale. Modelling indicates that SRM methods, if realizable, have the potential to substantially offset a global temperature rise, but they would also modify the global water cycle, and would not reduce ocean acidification. If SRM were terminated for any reason, there is high confidence that global surface temperatures would rise very rapidly to values consistent with the greenhouse gas forcing. CDR and SRM methods carry side effects and long-term consequences on a global scale. 	0
Box SPM.1: Representative Concentration Pathways  Climate change projections in IPCC Working Group I require information about future emissions or concentrations of greenhouse gases, aerosols and other climate drivers. This information is often expressed as a scenario of human activities, which are not assessed in this report. Scenarios used in Working Group I have focused on anthropogenic emissions and do not include changes in natural drivers such as solar or volcanic forcing or natural emissions, for example, of CH4 and N2O. For the Fifth Assessment Report of IPCC, the scientific community has defined a set of four new scenarios, denoted Representative Concentration Pathways . They are identified by their approximate total radiative forcing in year 2100 relative to 1750: 2.6 W m-2 for RCP2.6, 4.5 W m-2 for RCP4.5, 6.0 W m-2 for RCP6.0, and 8.5 W m-2 for RCP8.5. For the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  results, these values should be understood as indicative only, as the climate forcing resulting from all drivers varies between models due to specific model characteristics and treatment of short-lived climate forcers. These four RCPs include one mitigation scenario leading to a very low forcing level , two stabilization scenarios , and one scenario with very high greenhouse gas emissions . The RCPs can thus represent a range of 21st century climate policies, as compared with the no-climate policy of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios  used in the Third Assessment Report and the Fourth Assessment Report. For RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, radiative forcing does not peak by year 2100; for RCP2.6 it peaks and declines; and for RCP4.5 it stabilizes by 2100. Each RCP provides spatially resolved data sets of land use change and sector-based emissions of air pollutants, and it specifies annual greenhouse gas concentrations and anthropogenic emissions up to 2100. RCPs are based on a combination of integrated assessment models, simple climate models, atmospheric chemistry and global carbon cycle models. While the RCPs span a wide range of total forcing values, they do not cover the full range of emissions in the literature, particularly for aerosols. Most of the CMIP5 and Earth System Model simulations were performed with prescribed CO2 concentrations reaching 421 ppm , 538 ppm , 670 ppm , and 936 ppm  by the year 2100. Including also the prescribed concentrations of CH4 and N2O, the combined CO2-equivalent concentrations are 475 ppm , 630 ppm , 800 ppm , and 1313 ppm . For RCP8.5, additional CMIP5 Earth System Model simulations are performed with prescribed CO2 emissions as provided by the integrated assessment models. For all RCPs, additional calculations were made with updated atmospheric chemistry data and models  using the RCP prescribed emissions of the chemically reactive gases . These simulations enable investigation of uncertainties related to carbon cycle feedbacks and atmospheric chemistry.	0

Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis is the contribution of Working Group I  to the Fifth Assessment Report  of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . This comprehensive assessment of the physical aspects of climate change puts a focus on those elements that are relevant to understand past, document current and project future climate change. The assessment builds on the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report 1 and the recent Special Report on Managing the Risk of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation 2 and is presented in 14 chapters and 3 annexes. The chapters cover direct and proxy observations of changes in all components of the climate system; assess the current knowledge of various processes within, and interactions among, climate system components, which determine the sensitivity and response of the system to changes in forcing; and quantify the link between the changes in atmospheric constituents, and hence radiative forcing 3, and the consequent detection and attribution of climate change. Projections of changes in all climate system components are based on model simulations forced by a new set of scenarios. The Report also provides a comprehensive assessment of past and future sea level change in a dedicated chapter. Regional climate change information is presented in the form of an Atlas of Global and Regional Climate Projections . This is complemented by Annex II: Climate System Scenario Tables and Annex III: Glossary.	0
the scientific studies considered4. Confidence is expressed qualitatively. Quantified measures of uncertainty in a finding are expressed probabilistically and are based on a combination of statistical analyses of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgement. Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers . The Technical Summary is structured into four main sections presenting the assessment results following the storyline of the WGI contribution to AR5: Section TS.2 covers the assessment of observations of changes in the climate system; Section TS.3 summarizes the information on the different drivers, natural and anthropogenic, expressed in terms of RF; Section TS.4 presents the assessment of the quantitative understanding of observed climate change; and Section TS.5 summarizes the assessment results for projections of future climate change over the 21st century and beyond from regional to global scale. Section TS.6 combines and lists key uncertainties from the WGI assessment from Sections TS.2 to TS.5. The overall nine TFEs, cutting across the various components of the WGI AR5, are dispersed throughout the four main TS sections, are visually distinct from the main text and should allow stand-alone reading. The basis for substantive paragraphs in this Technical Summary can be found in the chapter sections of the underlying report. These references are given in curly brackets.	0
The primary purpose of this Technical Summary  is to provide the link between the complete assessment of the multiple lines of independent evidence presented in the 14 chapters of the main report and the highly condensed summary prepared as the WGI Summary for Policymakers . The Technical Summary thus serves as a starting point for those readers who seek the full information on more specific topics covered by this assessment. This purpose is facilitated by including pointers to the chapters and sections where the full assessment can be found. Policy-relevant topics, which cut across many chapters and involve many interlinked processes in the climate system, are presented here as Thematic Focus Elements , allowing rapid access to this information. An integral element of this report is the use of uncertainty language that permits a traceable account of the assessment . The degree of certainty in key findings in this assessment is based on the author teams' evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a level of confidence that results from the type, amount, quality and consistency of evidence and the degree of agreement in	0
Box TS.1 | Treatment of Uncertainty Based on the Guidance Note for Lead Authors of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report on Consistent Treatment of Uncertainties, this WGI Technical Summary and the WGI Summary for Policymakers rely on two metrics for communicating the degree of certainty in key findings, which is based on author teams' evaluations of underlying scientific understanding: * Confidence in the validity of a finding, based on the type, amount, quality and consistency of evidence  and the degree of agreement. Confidence is expressed qualitatively. * Quantified measures of uncertainty in a finding expressed probabilistically . The AR5 Guidance Note refines the guidance provided to support the IPCC Third and Fourth Assessment Reports. Direct comparisons between assessment of uncertainties in findings in this Report and those in the AR4 and the SREX are difficult, because of the application of the revised guidance note on uncertainties, as well as the availability of new information, improved scientific understanding, continued analyses of data and models and specific differences in methodologies applied in the assessed studies. For some climate variables, different aspects have been assessed and therefore a direct comparison would be inappropriate.	0
Each key finding is based on an author team's evaluation of associated evidence and agreement. The confidence metric provides a qualitative synthesis of an author team's judgement about the validity of a finding, as determined through evaluation of evidence and agreement. If uncertainties can be quantified probabilistically, an author team can characterize a finding using the calibrated likelihood language or a more precise presentation of probability. Unless otherwise indicated, high or very high confidence is associated with findings for which an author team has assigned a likelihood term. The following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium, or high. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers very low, low, medium, high, and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. Box TS.1, Figure 1 depicts summary statements for evidence and agreement and their relationship to confidence. There is flexibility in this relationship; for a given evidence and agreement statement, different confidence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement correlate with increasing confidence.	0
Despite the robust multi-decadal warming, there exists substantial interannual to decadal variability in the rate of warming, with several periods exhibiting weaker trends  . The rate of warming over the past 15 years  C per decade) is smaller than the trend since 1951  C per decade). Trends for short periods are uncertain and very sensitive to the start and end years. For example, trends for 15-year periods starting in 1995, 1996, and 1997 are 0.13  C per decade, 0.14  C per decade and 0.07  C per decade, respectively. Several independently analysed data records of global and regional land surface air temperature obtained from station observations are in broad agreement that land surface air temperatures have increased. Sea surface temperatures  have also increased. Intercomparisons of new SST data records obtained by different measurement methods, including satellite data, have resulted in better understanding of errors and biases in the records. 	0
Observations of the climate system are based on direct physical and biogeochemical measurements, and remote sensing from ground stations and satellites; information derived from paleoclimate archives provides a long-term context. Global-scale observations from the instrumental era began in the mid-19th century, and paleoclimate reconstructions extend the record of some quantities back hundreds to millions of years. Together, they provide a comprehensive view of the variability and long-term changes in the atmosphere, the ocean, the cryosphere and at the land surface. The assessment of observational evidence for climate change is summarized in this section. Substantial advancements in the availability, acquisition, quality and analysis of observational data sets for the atmosphere, land surface, ocean and cryosphere have occurred since the AR4. Many aspects of the climate system are showing evidence of a changing climate. 	0
TS.2.2.1 Surface It is certain that global mean surface temperature  has increased since the late 19th century . Each of the past three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any the previous decades in the instrumental record, and the decade of the 2000's has been the warmest. The globally averaged combined land and ocean temperature data as calculated by a linear trend5, show a warming of 0.85  C6, over the period 1880-2012, when multiple independently produced datasets exist, about 0.89  C over the period 1901-2012, and about 0.72  C over the period 1951-2012 when based on three independently-produced data sets. The total increase between the average of the 1850-1900 period and the 2003-2012 period is 0.78  C, based on the Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit gridded surface temperature data set 4 , the global mean surface temperature dataset with the longest record of the three independently-produced data sets. The warming from 1850-1900 to 1986-2005  is 0.61  C, when calculated using HadCRUT4 and its uncertainty estimates. It is also virtually certain that maximum and minimum temperatures over	0
It is unlikely that any uncorrected urban heat island effects and land use change effects have raised the estimated centennial globally averaged land surface air temperature trends by more than 10% of the reported trend. This is an average value; in some regions that have rapidly developed urban heat island and land use change impacts on regional trends may be substantially larger. There is high confidence that annual mean surface warming since the 20th century has reversed long-term cooling trends of the past 5000 years in mid-to-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere . For average annual NH temperatures, the period 1983-2012 was very likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years  and likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years . This is supported by comparison of instrumental temperatures with multiple reconstructions from a variety of proxy data and statistical methods, and is consistent with AR4. Continental-scale surface temperature reconstructions show, with high confidence, multidecadal periods during the Medieval Climate Anomaly  that were in some regions as warm as in the mid-20th century and in others as warm as in the late 20th century. With high confidence, these regional warm periods were not as synchronous across regions as the warming since the mid-20th century. Based on the comparison between reconstructions and simulations, there is high confidence that not only external orbital, solar and volcanic forcing, but also internal	0
In the WGI contribution to the AR5, uncertainty is quantified using 90% uncertainty intervals unless otherwise stated. The 90% uncertainty interval, reported in square brackets, is expected to have a 90% likelihood of covering the value that is being estimated. The upper endpoint of the uncertainty interval has a 95% likelihood of exceeding the value that is being estimated and the lower endpoint has a 95% likelihood of being less than that value. A best estimate of that value is also given where available. Uncertainty intervals are not necessarily symmetric about the corresponding best estimate.	0
Large variability on interannual to decadal time scales hampers robust conclusions on long-term changes in atmospheric circulation in many instances. Confidence is high that the increase of the northern midlatitude westerly winds and the North Atlantic Oscillation  index from the 1950s to the 1990s, and the weakening of the Pacific Walker Circulation from the late 19th century to the 1990s, have been largely offset by recent changes. With high confidence, decadal and multidecadal changes in the winter NAO index observed since the 20th century are not unprecedented in the context of the past 500 years. 	0

Trends have been calculated only for those grid boxes with greater than 70% complete records and more than 20% data availability in the first and last 10% of the time period. Black plus signs  indicate grid boxes where trends are significant . Differences in coverage primarily reflect the degree of interpolation to account for data void regions undertaken by the data set providers ranging from none beyond grid box averaging ) to substantial ).

Recent observations have strengthened evidence for variability in major ocean circulation systems on time scales from years to decades. It is very likely that the subtropical gyres in the North Pacific and South Pacific have expanded and strengthened since 1993. Based on measurements of the full Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation  and its individual components at various latitudes and different time periods, there is no evidence of a long-term trend. There is also no evidence for trends in the transports of the Indonesian Throughflow, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current  or in the transports between the Atlantic Ocean and Nordic Seas. However, a southward shift of the ACC by about 1 of latitude is observed in data spanning the time period 1950-2010 with medium confidence. 	0
TS.2.5.2 Ocean and Surface Fluxes It is very likely that regional trends have enhanced the mean geographical contrasts in sea surface salinity since the 1950s: saline surface waters in the evaporation-dominated mid-latitudes have become more saline, while relatively fresh surface waters in rainfall-dominated tropical and polar regions have become fresher. The mean contrast between high- and low-salinity regions increased by 0.13  from 1950 to 2008. It is very likely that the inter-basin contrast in freshwater content has increased: the Atlantic has become saltier and the Pacific and Southern Oceans have freshened. Although similar conclusions were reached in AR4, recent studies based on expanded data sets and new analysis approaches provide high confidence in this assessment. 	0
TS.2.5.3 Sea Ice Continuing the trends reported in AR4, there is very high confidence that the Arctic sea ice extent  decreased over the period 1979-2012 . The rate of the annual decrease was very likely between 3.5 and 4.1% per decade . The average decrease in decadal extent of annual Arctic sea ice has been most rapid in summer and autumn , but the extent has decreased in every season, and in every successive decade since 1979 . The extent of Arctic perennial and multi-year ice decreased between 1979 and 2012 . The rates are very likely 11.5 % per decade  for the sea ice extent at summer minimum  and very likely 13.5  % per decade for multi-year ice. There is medium confidence from reconstructions that the current  Arctic summer sea ice retreat was unprecedented and SSTs were anomalously high in the perspective of at least the last 1,450 years. 	0
There is very high confidence that the Greenland ice sheet has lost ice during the last two decades. Combinations of satellite and airborne remote sensing together with field data indicate with high confidence that the ice loss has occurred in several sectors and that large rates of mass loss have spread to wider regions than reported in AR4 . There is high confidence that the mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet has accelerated since 1992: the average rate has very likely increased from 34  Gt yr-1 over the period 1992-2001  mm yr-1), to 215  Gt yr-1 over the period 2002-2011  mm yr-1). There is high confidence that ice loss from Greenland resulted from increased surface melt and runoff and increased outlet glacier discharge, and these occurred in similar amounts. There is high confidence that the area subject to summer melt has increased over the last two decades. 	0
TFE.1 | Water Cycle Change The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water through the climate system in its liquid, solid and vapour forms, and storage in the reservoirs of ocean, cryosphere, land surface and atmosphere. In the atmosphere, water occurs primarily as a gas, water vapour, but it also occurs as ice and liquid water in clouds. The ocean is primarily liquid water, but the ocean is partly covered by ice in polar regions. Terrestrial water in liquid form appears as surface water , soil moisture and groundwater. Solid terrestrial water occurs in ice sheets, glaciers, snow and ice on the surface and permafrost. The movement of water in the climate system is essential to life on land, as much of the water that falls on land as precipitation and supplies the soil moisture and river flow has been evaporated from the ocean and transported to land by the atmosphere. Water that falls as snow in winter can provide soil moisture in springtime and river flow in summer and is essential to both natural and human systems. The movement of fresh water between the atmosphere and the ocean can also influence oceanic salinity, which is an important driver of the density and circulation of the ocean. The latent heat contained in water vapour in the atmosphere is critical to driving the circulation of the atmosphere on scales ranging from individual thunderstorms to the global circulation of the atmosphere. 	0
Observations of Water Cycle Change Because the saturation vapour pressure of air increases with temperature, it is expected that the amount of water vapour in air will increase with a warming climate. Observations from surface stations, radiosondes, global positioning systems and satellite measurements indicate increases in tropospheric water vapour at large spatial scales . It is very likely that tropospheric specific humidity has increased since the 1970s. The magnitude of the observed global change in tropospheric water vapour of about 3.5% in the past 40 years is consistent with the observed temperature change of about 0.5C during the same period, and the relative humidity has stayed approximately constant. The water vapour change can be attributed to human influence with medium confidence. 	0

TS.2.5.5 Snow Cover, Freshwater Ice and Frozen Ground There is very high confidence that snow cover extent has decreased in the NH, especially in spring . Satellite records indicate that over the period 1967-2012, snow cover extent very likely decreased; the largest change, -53% , occurred in June. No month had statistically significant increases. Over the longer period, 1922- 2012, data are available only for March and April, but these show very likely a 7%  decline and a negative correlation  with March to April 40N to 60N land temperature. In the Southern Hemisphere , evidence is too limited to conclude whether changes have occurred. 	0
The primary contributions to changes in the volume of water in the ocean are the expansion of the ocean water as it warms and the transfer to the ocean of water currently stored on land, particularly from glaciers and ice sheets. Water impoundment in reservoirs and ground water depletion  also affect sea level. Change in sea level relative to the land  can be significantly different from the global mean sea level  change because of changes in the distribution of water in the ocean, vertical movement of the land and changes in the Earth's gravitational field. For an overview on the scientific understanding and uncertainties associated with recent  sea level change see TFE.2. During warm intervals of the mid Pliocene , when there is medium confidence that GMSTs were 1.9C to 3.6C warmer than for pre-industrial climate and carbon dioxide  levels were between 350 and 450 ppm, there is high confidence that GMSL was 46	0
Recent analyses of extreme events generally support the AR4 and SREX conclusions . It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale between 1951 and 2010. Globally, there is medium confidence that the length and frequency of warm spells, including heat waves, has increased since the middle of the 20th century, mostly owing to lack of data or studies in Africa and South America. However, it is likely that heat wave frequency has increased over this period in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. 	0
Observations indicate that the Greenland ice sheet has very likely experienced a net loss of mass due to both increased surface melting and runoff, and increased ice discharge over the last two decades . Regional climate models indicate that Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance showed no significant trend from the 1960s to the 1980s, but melting and consequent runoff has increased since the early 1990s. This tendency is related to pronounced regional warming, which may be attributed to a combination of anomalous regional variability in recent years and anthropogenic climate change. High confidence in projections of future warming in Greenland and increased surface melting is based on the qualitative agreements of models in projecting amplified warming at high northern latitudes for well-understood physical reasons. 	0

The black line is the mean of the grey lines plus a correction of thermal expansion for the omission of volcanic forcing in the Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model  control experiments . The dashed black line  is the sum of the corrected model mean thermal expansion, the change in land water storage, the glacier estimate using observed  climate , and an illustrative long-term ice-sheet contribution . The dotted black line is the adjusted model mean but now including the observed ice-sheet contributions, which begin in 1993. Because the observational ice-sheet estimates include the glaciers peripheral to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets , the contribution from glaciers to the adjusted model mean excludes the peripheral glaciers  to avoid double counting. 	0
GMSL rise for 2081-2100  for the Representative Concentration Pathways  will likely be in the 5 to 95% ranges derived from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  climate projections in combination with process-based models of other contributions , that is, 0.26 to 0.55 m , 0.32 to 0.63 m , 0.33 to 0.63 m , 0.45 to 0.82  m . For RCP8.5 the range at 2100 is 0.52 to 0.98 m. Confidence in the projected likely ranges comes from the consistency of process-based models with observations and physical understanding. It is assessed that there is currently insufficient evidence to evaluate the probability of specific levels above the likely range. Based on current understanding, only the collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause GMSL to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. There is a lack of consensus on the probability for such a collapse, and the potential additional contribution to GMSL rise cannot be precisely quantified, but there is medium confidence that it would not exceed several tenths of a metre of sea level rise during the 21st century. It is virtually certain that GMSL rise will continue beyond 2100. 	0
TS.2.7.2 Oceans It is likely that the magnitude of extreme high sea level events has increased since 1970 . Most of the increase in extreme sea level can be explained by the mean sea level rise: changes in extreme high sea levels are reduced to less than 5 mm yr-1 at 94% of tide gauges once the rise in mean sea level is accounted for. There is medium confidence based on reanalysis forced model hindcasts and ship observations that mean significant wave height has increased since the 1950s over much of the North Atlantic north of 45N, with typical winter season trends of up to 20 cm per decade. 	0
TS.2.8.1 Carbon Dioxide Between 1750 and 2011, CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production are estimated from energy and fuel use statistics to have released 375  PgC9. In 2002-2011, average fossil fuel and cement manufacturing emissions were 8.3  PgC yr-1 , with an average growth rate of 3.2% yr-1 . This rate of increase of fossil fuel emissions is higher than during the 1990s . In 2011, fossil fuel emissions were 9.5  PgC. Of the 555  PgC released to the atmosphere from fossil fuel and land use emissions from 1750 to 2011, 240  PgC accumulated in the atmosphere, as estimated with very high accuracy from the observed increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration from 278  ppm10 in 1750 to 390.5  ppm in 2011. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere grew by 4.0  PgC yr-1 in the first decade of the 21st century. The distribution of observed atmospheric CO2 increases with latitude clearly shows that the increases are driven by anthropogenic emissions that occur primarily in the industrialized countries north of the equator. Based on annual average concentrations, stations in the NH show slightly higher concentrations than stations in the SH. An independent line of evidence	0

Fossil fuel and cement CO2 emissions by category, estimated by the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center .  Fossil fuel and cement CO2 emissions as above. CO2 emissions from net land use change, mainly deforestation, are based on land cover change data . The atmospheric CO2 growth rate prior to 1959 is based on a spline fit to ice core observations and a synthesis of atmospheric measurements from 1959. The fit to ice core observations does not capture the large interannual variability in atmospheric CO2 and is represented with a dashed line. The ocean CO2 sink is from a combination of models and observations. The residual land sink  is computed from the residual of the other terms. The emissions and their partitioning include only the fluxes that have changed since 1750, and not the natural CO2 fluxes  between the atmosphere, land and ocean reservoirs that existed before that time and still exist today. The uncertainties in the various terms are discussed in Chapter 6 and reported in Table 6.1 for decadal mean values. 	0
TS.2.8.3 Methane The concentration of CH4 has increased by a factor of 2.5 since preindustrial times, from 722  ppb in 1750 to 1803  ppb in 2011 . There is very high confidence that the atmospheric CH4 increase during the Industrial Era is caused by anthropogenic activities. The massive increase in the number of ruminants, the emissions from fossil fuel extraction and use, the expansion of rice paddy agriculture and the emissions from landfills and waste are the dominant anthropogenic CH4 sources. Anthropogenic emissions account for 50 to 65% of total emissions. By including natural geological CH4 emissions that were not accounted for in previous budgets, the fossil component of the total CH4 emissions  is now estimated to amount to about 30% of the total CH4 emissions . 	0

Human activities have changed and continue to change the Earth's surface and atmospheric composition. Some of these changes have a direct or indirect impact on the energy balance of the Earth and are thus drivers of climate change. Radiative forcing  is a measure of the net change in the energy balance of the Earth system in response to some external perturbation , with positive RF leading to a warming and negative RF to a cooling. The RF concept is valuable for comparing the influence on GMST of most individual agents affecting the Earth's radiation balance. The quantitative values provided in AR5 are consistent with those in previous IPCC reports, though there have been some important revisions . Effective radiative forcing  is now used to quantify the impact of some forcing agents that involve rapid adjustments of components of the atmosphere and surface that are assumed constant in the RF concept . RF and ERF are estimated from the change between 1750 and 2011, referred to as `Industrial Era', if other time periods are not explicitly stated. Uncertainties are given associated with the best estimates of RF and ERF, with values representing the 5 to 95%  confidence range. 	0
in well-mixed greenhouse gas  concentrations during the Industrial Era . As historical WMGHG concentrations since the pre-industrial are well known based on direct measurements and ice core records, and WMGHG radiative properties are also well known, the computation of RF due to concentration changes provides tightly constrained values . There has not been significant change in our understanding of WMGHG radiative impact, so that the changes in RF estimates relative to AR4 are due essentially to concentration increases. The best estimate for WMGHG ERF is the same as RF, but the uncertainty range is twice as large due to the poorly constrained cloud responses. Owing to highquality observations, it is certain that increasing atmospheric burdens of most WMGHGs, especially CO2, resulted in a further increase in their RF from 2005 to 2011. Based on concentration changes, the RF of all WMGHGs in 2011 is 2.83  W m-2 . This is an increase since AR4 of 0.20  W m-2, with nearly all of the increase due to the increase in the abundance of CO2 since 2005. The Industrial Era RF for CO2 alone is 1.82  W m-2. Over the last 15 years, CO2 has been the dominant contributor to the increase in RF from the WMGHGs, with RF of CO2 having an average growth rate slightly less than 0.3 W m-2 per decade. The uncertainty in the WMGHG RF is due in part to its radiative properties but mostly to the full accounting of atmospheric radiative transfer including clouds. Atmospheric N2O has increased by 6% since AR4, causing an RF of 0.17  W m-2. N2O concentrations continue to rise while those of dichlorodifluoromethane , the third largest WMGHG contributor to RF for several decades, are decreasing due to phaseout of emissions of this chemical under the Montreal Protocol.

observations cover a limited area) and flattened over Europe during the last decade. The total RF due to changes in O3 is 0.35  W m-2 , with RF due to tropospheric O3 of 0.40  W m-2  and due to stratospheric O3 of -0.05  W m-2 . O3 is not emitted directly into the atmosphere; instead it is formed by photochemical reactions. In the troposphere these reactions involve precursor compounds that are emitted into the atmosphere from a variety of natural and anthropogenic sources. Tropospheric O3 RF is largely attributed to increases in emissions of CH4, carbon monoxide, volatile organics and nitrogen oxides, while stratospheric RF results primarily from O3 depletion by anthropogenic halocarbons. However, there is now strong evidence for substantial links between the changes in tropospheric and stratospheric O3 and a total O3 RF of 0.50  W m-2 is attributed to tropospheric O3 precursor emissions and -0.15  W m-2 to O3 depletion by halocarbons. There is strong evidence that tropospheric O3 also has a detrimental impact on vegetation physiology, and therefore on its CO2 uptake. This reduced uptake leads to an indirect increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Thus a fraction of the CO2 RF should be attributed to ozone or its precursors rather than direct emission of CO2, but there is a low confidence on the quantitative estimates. RF for stratospheric water vapour produced from CH4 oxidation is 0.07  W m-2. Other changes in stratospheric water vapour, and all changes in water vapour in the troposphere, are regarded as a feedback rather than a forcing. 	0
There is robust evidence that anthropogenic land use changes such as deforestation have increased the land surface albedo, which leads to an RF of -0.15  W m-2. There is still a large spread of quantitative estimates owing to different assumptions for the albedo of natural and managed surfaces . In addition, the time evolution of the land use change, and in particular how much was already completed in the reference year 1750, are still debated. Furthermore, land use change causes other modifications that are not radiative but impact the surface temperature, including modifications in the surface roughness, latent heat flux, river runoff and irrigation. These are more uncertain and they are difficult to quantify, but they tend to offset the impact of albedo changes at the global scale. As a consequence, there is low agreement on the sign of the net change in global mean temperature as a result of land use change. Land use change, and in particular deforestation, also has significant impacts on WMGHG concentrations. It contributes to the corresponding RF associated with CO2 emissions or concentration changes. 	0
Anthropogenic aerosols are responsible for an RF of climate through multiple processes which can be grouped into two types: aerosol-radiation interactions  and aerosol-cloud interactions . There has been progress since AR4 on observing and modelling climate-relevant aerosol properties  and their atmospheric distribution. Nevertheless, substantial uncertainties remain in assessments of long-term trends of global aerosol optical depth and other global properties of aerosols due to difficulties in measurement and lack of observations of some relevant parameters, high spatial and temporal variability and the relatively short observational records that exist. The anthropogenic RFari is given a best estimate of -0.35  W m-2  using evidence from aerosol models and some constraints from observations. The RFari is caused by multiple aerosol types . The rapid adjustment to RFari leads to further negative forcing, in particular through cloud adjustments, and is attributable primarily to black carbon. As a consequence, the ERFari is more negative than the RFari  and given a best estimate of -0.45  W m-2. The assessment for RFari is less negative than reported in AR4 because of a re-evaluation of aerosol absorption. The uncertainty estimate is wider but more robust. Improved understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions has led to a reduction in the magnitude of many global aerosol-cloud forcings estimates. The total ERF due to aerosols  is assessed to be -0.9  W m-2 . This estimate encompasses all rapid adjustments, including changes to the cloud lifetime and aerosol	0
The RF from black carbon  on snow and ice is assessed to be 0.04  W m-2 . Unlike in the previous IPCC assessment, this estimate includes the effects on sea ice, accounts for more physical processes and incorporates evidence from both models and observations. This RF causes a two to four times larger GMST change per unit forcing than CO2 primarily because all of the forcing energy is deposited directly into the cryosphere, whose evolution drives a positive albedo feedback on climate. This effect thus can represent a significant forcing mechanism in the Arctic and other snow- or ice-covered regions. 	0
of total solar irradiance  changes since 1978 show quasi-periodic cyclical variation with a period of roughly 11 years. Longer term forcing is typically estimated by comparison of solar minima . This gives an RF change of -0.04  W m-2 between the most recent  minimum and the 1986 minimum. There is some diversity in the estimated trends of the composites of various satellite data, however. Secular trends of TSI before the start of satellite observations rely on a number of indirect proxies. The best estimate of RF from TSI changes over the industrial era is 0.05  W m-2 , which includes greater RF up to around 1980 and then a small downward trend. This RF estimate is substantially smaller than the AR4 estimate due to the addition of the latest solar cycle and inconsistencies in how solar RF was estimated in earlier IPCC assessments. The recent solar minimum appears to have been unusually low and long-lasting and several projections indicate lower TSI for the forthcoming decades. However, current abilities to project solar irradiance are extremely limited so that there is very low confidence concerning future solar forcing. Nonetheless, there is a high confidence that 21st century solar forcing will be much smaller than the projected increased forcing due to WMGHGs. 	0
to AR4, the confidence level has been elevated for seven forcing agents owing to improved evidence and understanding. Although the WMGHGs show a spatially fairly homogeneous forcing, other agents such as aerosols, ozone and land use changes are highly heterogeneous spatially. RFari showed maximum negative values over eastern North America and Europe during the early 20th century, with large negative values extending to East and Southeast Asia, South America and central Africa by 1980. Since then, however, the magnitude has decreased over eastern North America and Europe due to pollution control, and the peak negative forcing has shifted to South and East Asia primarily as a result of economic growth and the resulting increase in emissions in those areas. Total aerosol ERF shows similar behaviour for locations with maximum negative forcing, but also shows substantial positive forcing over some deserts and the Arctic. In contrast, the global mean whole atmosphere ozone forcing increased throughout	0
the 20th century, and has peak positive amplitudes around 15N to 30N but negative values over Antarctica. Negative land use forcing by albedo changes has been strongest in industrialized and biomass burning regions. The inhomogeneous nature of these forcings can cause them to have a substantially larger influence on the hydrologic cycle than an equivalent global mean homogeneous forcing. Over the 21st century, anthropogenic RF is projected to increase under the Representative Concentration Pathways . Simple model estimates of the RF resulting from the RCPs, which include WMGHG emissions spanning a broad range of possible futures, show anthropogenic RF relative to 1750 increasing to 3.0 to 4.8 W m-2 in 2050, and 2.7 to 8.4 W m-2 at 2100. In the near term, the RCPs are quite similar to one another , with RF at 2030 ranging only from 2.9 to 3.3 W m-2 , but they show highly diverging values for the second half of the 21st century driven largely by CO2. Results based on	0
the RCP scenarios suggest only small changes in aerosol ERF between 2000 and 2030, followed by a strong reduction in the aerosols and a substantial weakening of the negative total aerosol ERF. Nitrate aerosols are an exception to this reduction, with a substantially increased negative forcing which is a robust feature among the few available models. The divergence across the RCPs indicates that, although a certain amount of future climate change is already `in the system' due to the current radiative imbalance caused by historical emissions and the long lifetime of some atmospheric forcing agents, societal choices can still have a very large effect on future RF, and hence on climate change. 	0

temperature increase. Snow and ice albedo feedbacks are known to be positive. The combined water vapour and lapse rate feedback is extremely likely to be positive and now fairly well quantified, while cloud feedbacks continue to have larger uncertainties . In addition, the new Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  models consistently estimate a positive carbon-cycle feedback, that is, reduced natural CO2 sinks in response to future climate change. In particular, carbon-cycle feedbacks in the oceans are positive in the models. Carbon sinks in tropical land ecosystems are less consistent, and may be susceptible to climate change via processes such as drought and fire that are sometimes not yet fully represented. A key update since AR4 is the introduction of nutrient dynamics in some of the CMIP5 land carbon models, in particular the limitations on plant growth imposed by nitrogen availability. The net effect of accounting for the nitrogen cycle is a smaller projected land sink for a given trajectory of anthropogenic CO2 emissions . 	0
Different metrics can be used to quantify and communicate the relative and absolute contributions to climate change of emissions of different substances, and of emissions from regions/countries or sources/sectors. Up to AR4, the most common metric has been the Global Warming Potential  that integrates RF out to a particular time horizon. This metric thus accounts for the radiative efficiencies of the various substances, and their lifetimes in the atmosphere, and gives values relative to those for the reference gas CO2. There is now increasing focus on the Global Temperature change Potential , which is based on the change in GMST at a chosen point in time, again relative to that caused by the reference gas CO2, and thus accounts for climate response along with radiative efficiencies and atmospheric lifetimes. Both the GWP and the GTP use a time horizon , the choice of which is subjective and context dependent. In general, GWPs for near-term 58	0
climate forcers are higher than GTPs due to the equal time weighting in the integrated forcing used in the GWP. Hence the choice of metric can greatly affect the relative importance of near-term climate forcers and WMGHGs, as can the choice of time horizon. Analysis of the impact of current emissions  shows that near-term climate forcers, such as black carbon, sulphur dioxide or CH4, can have contributions comparable to that of CO2 for short time horizons , but their impacts become progressively less for longer time horizons over which emissions of CO2 dominate . With these emission metrics, the climate impact of past or current emissions attributable to various activities can be assessed. Such activity-based accounting can provide additional policy-relevant information, as these activities are more directly affected by particular societal choices than overall emissions. A single year's worth of emissions  is often used to quantify the impact on future climate. From this perspective and with the absolute GTP metric used to illustrate the results, energy and industry have the largest contributions to warming over the next 50 to 100 years . Household fossil and biofuel, biomass burning and on-road transportation are also relatively large contributors to warming over these time scales, while current emissions from sectors that emit large amounts of CH4  are also important over	0

The units are `CO2 equivalents', which reflects equivalence only in the impact parameter of the chosen metric , given as Pgeq  and PgCeq .

Several advances since the AR4 have allowed a more robust quantification of human influence on surface temperature changes. Observational uncertainty has been explored much more thoroughly than previously and the assessment now considers observations from the first decade of the 21st century and simulations from a new generation of climate models whose ability to simulate historical climate has improved in many respects relative to the previous generation of models considered in AR4. Observed GMST anomalies relative to 1880-1919 in recent years lie well outside the range of GMST anomalies in CMIP5 simulations with natural forcing only, but are consistent with the ensemble of CMIP5 simulations including both anthropogenic and natural forcing  even though some individual models overestimate the warming trend, while others underestimate it. Simulations with WMGHG changes only, and no aerosol changes, generally exhibit stronger warming than has been observed . Observed temperature trends over the period 1951-2010, which are characterized by warming over most of the globe with the most intense warming over the NH continents, are, at most observed locations, consistent with the temperature trends in CMIP5 simulations including anthropogenic and natural forcings and inconsistent with the temperature trends in CMIP5 simulations including natural forcings only. A number of studies have investigated the effects of the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation  on GMST. Although some studies find a significant role for the AMO in driving multi-decadal variability in GMST, the AMO exhibited little trend over the period 1951-2010 on which the current assessments are based, and the AMO is assessed with high confidence to have made little contribution to the GMST trend between 1951 and 2010 . It is extremely likely that human activities caused more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010. This assessment is supported by robust evidence from multiple studies using different methods. In particular, the temperature trend attributable to all anthropogenic forcings combined can be more closely constrained in multi-signal detection and attribution analyses. Uncertainties in forcings and in climate models' responses to those forcings, together with difficulty in distinguishing the patterns of temperature response due to WMGHGs and other anthropogenic forcings, prevent as precise a quantification of the temperature changes a ttributable to 60	0

Box TS.3 | Climate Models and the Hiatus in Global Mean Surface Warming of the Past 15 Years The observed GMST has shown a much smaller increasing linear trend over the past 15 years than over the past 30 to 60 years . Depending on the observational data set, the GMST trend over 1998-2012 is estimated to be around one third to one half of the trend over 1951-2012. For example, in HadCRUT4 the trend is 0.04C per decade over 1998-2012, compared to 0.11C per decade over 1951-2012. The reduction in observed GMST trend is most marked in NH winter. Even with this `hiatus' in GMST trend, the decade of the 2000s has been the warmest in the instrumental record of GMST. Nevertheless, the occurrence of the hiatus in GMST trend during the past 15 years raises the two related questions of what has caused it and whether climate models are able to reproduce it. 	0
Internal Climate Variability Hiatus periods of 10 to 15 years can arise as a manifestation of internal decadal climate variability, which sometimes enhances and sometimes counteracts the long-term externally forced trend. Internal variability thus diminishes the relevance of trends over periods as short as 10 to 15 years for long-term climate change. Furthermore, the timing of internal decadal climate variability is not expected to be matched by the CMIP5 historical simulations, owing to the predictability horizon of at most 10 to 20 years . However, climate models exhibit individual decades of GMST trend hiatus even during a prolonged phase of energy uptake of the climate system, in which case the energy budget would be balanced by increasing subsurface-ocean heat uptake. Unlike the CMIP5 historical simulations referred to above, some CMIP5 predictions were initialized from the observed climate state during the late 1990s and the early 21st century. There is medium evidence that these initialized predictions show a GMST lower by about 0.05C to 0.1C compared to the historical  simulations and maintain this lower GMST during the first few years of the simulation. In some initialized models this lower GMST occurs in part because they correctly simulate a shift, around 2000, from a positive to a negative phase of the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation . However, the improvement of this phasing of the IPO through initialization is not universal across the CMIP5 predictions. Moreover, although part of the GMST reduction through initialization indeed results from initializing at the correct phase of internal variability, another part may result from correcting a model bias that was caused by incorrect past forcing or incorrect model response to past forcing, especially in the ocean. The relative magnitudes of these effects are at present unknown; moreover, the quality of a forecasting system cannot be evaluated from a single prediction 	0
The reduction in AR5 best-estimate ERF trend over 1998-2011 compared to both 1984-1998 and 1951-2011 is mostly due to decreasing trends in the natural forcings, -0.16  W m-2 per decade over 1998-2011 compared to 0.01  W m-2 per decade over 1951-2011. Solar forcing went from a relative maximum in 2000 to a relative minimum in 2009, with a peak-to-peak difference of around 0.15 W m-2 and a linear trend over 1998-2011 of around -0.10 W m-2 per decade. Furthermore, a series of small volcanic eruptions has increased the observed stratospheric aerosol loading after 2000, leading to an additional negative ERF lineartrend contribution of around -0.06 W m-2 per decade over 1998-2011 . By contrast, satellite-derived estimates of tropospheric aerosol optical depth suggests little overall trend in global mean aerosol optical depth over the last 10 years, implying little change in ERF due to aerosol-radiative interaction . Moreover, because there is only low confidence in estimates of ERF due to aerosol-cloud interaction, there is likewise low confidence in its trend over the last 15 years.  62	0
In summary, the observed recent warming hiatus, defined as the reduction in GMST trend during 1998-2012 as compared to the trend during 1951-2012, is attributable in roughly equal measure to a cooling contribution from internal variability and a reduced trend in external forcing . The forcing trend reduction is due primarily to a negative forcing trend from both volcanic eruptions and the downward phase of the solar cycle. However, there is low confidence in quantifying the role of forcing trend in causing the hiatus, because of uncertainty in the magnitude of the volcanic forcing trend and low confidence in the aerosol forcing trend. 	0
The causes of both the observed GMST trend hiatus and of the model-observation GMST trend difference during 1998-2012 imply that, barring a major volcanic eruption, most 15-year GMST trends in the near-term future will be larger than during 1998-2012 . The reasons for this implication are fourfold: first, anthropogenic GHG concentrations are expected to rise further in all RCP scenarios; second, anthropogenic aerosol concentration is expected to decline in all RCP scenarios, and so is the resulting cooling effect; third, the trend in solar forcing is expected to be larger over most near-term 15-year periods than over 1998-2012 , because 1998-2012 contained the full downward phase of the solar cycle; and fourth, it is more likely than not that internal climate variability in the near term will enhance and not counteract the surface warming expected to arise from the increasing anthropogenic forcing. 	0

TFE.3 | Comparing Projections from Previous IPCC Assessments with Observations Verification of projections is arguably the most convincing way of establishing the credibility of climate change science. Results of projected changes in carbon dioxide , global mean surface temperature  and global mean sea level  from previous IPCC assessment reports are quantitatively compared with the best available observational estimates. The comparison between the four previous reports highlights the evolution in our understanding of how the climate system responds to changes in both natural and anthropogenic forcing and provides an assessment of how the projections compare with observational estimates.

WMGHGs and other anthropogenic forcings individually. Consistent with AR4, it is assessed that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 is very likely due to the observed anthropogenic increase in WMGHG concentrations. WMGHGs contributed a global mean surface warming likely to be between 0.5C and 1.3C over the period between 1951 and 2010, with the contributions from other anthropogenic forcings likely to be between -0.6C and 0.1C and from natural forcings likely to be between -0.1C and 0.1C. Together these assessed contributions are consistent with the observed warming of approximately 0.6C over this period . Observed warming over the past 60 years is far outside the range of internal climate variability estimated from pre-instrumental data, and it is also far outside the range of internal variability simulated in climate models. Model-based simulations of internal variability are assessed to be adequate to make this assessment. Further, the spatial pattern of 66	0
A number of studies since the AR4 have investigated the consistency of simulated and observed trends in free tropospheric temperatures . Most, though not all, CMIP3 and CMIP5 models overestimate the observed warming trend in the tropical troposphere during the satellite period 1979-2012. Roughly one half to two thirds of this difference from the observed trend is due to an overestimate of the SST trend, which is propagated upward because models attempt to maintain static stability. There is low confidence in these assessments, however, owing to the low confidence in observed tropical tropospheric trend rates and vertical structure. Outside the tropics, and over the period of the radiosonde record beginning in 1961, the discrepancy between simulated and observed trends is smaller. CMIP5 simulations including WMGHGs, ozone and natural forcing changes broadly reproduce the observed evolution of lower stratospheric temperature, with some tendency to underestimate the observed cooling trend over the satellite era . New studies of stratospheric temperature, considering the responses to natural forcings, WMGHGs and ozone-depleting substances, demonstrate that it is very likely that anthropogenic forcings, dominated by the depletion of the ozone layer due to ozone depleting substances have contributed to the cooling of the lower stratosphere since 1979. CMIP5 models simulate only a very weak cooling of the lower stratosphere in response to historical WMGHG changes, and the influence of WMGHGs on lower stratospheric temperature has not been formally detected. Considering both regions together, it is very likely that anthropogenic	0
TFE.4 | The Changing Energy Budget of the Global Climate System The global energy budget is a fundamental aspect of the Earth's climate system and depends on many phenomena within it. The ocean has stored about 93% of the increase in energy in the climate system over recent decades, resulting in ocean thermal expansion and hence sea level rise. The rate of storage of energy in the Earth system must be equal to the net downward radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, which is the difference between effective radiative forcing  due to changes imposed on the system and the radiative response of the system. There are also significant transfers of energy between components of the climate system and from one location to another. The focus here is on the Earth's global energy budget since 1970, when better global observational data coverage is available. The ERF of the climate system has been positive as a result of increases in well-mixed  greenhouse gas  concentrations, changes in short-lived GHGs , and an increase in solar irradiance . This has been partly compensated by a negative contribution to the ERF of the climate system as a result of changes in tropospheric aerosol, which predominantly reflect sunlight and furthermore enhance the brightness of clouds, although black carbon produces positive forcing. Explosive volcanic eruptions 	0
TFE.4, Figure 1 | The Earth's energy budget from 1970 through 2011.  The cumulative energy inflow into the Earth system from changes in well-mixed and shortlived greenhouse gases, solar forcing, tropospheric aerosol forcing, volcanic forcing and changes in surface albedo due to land use change  are shown by the coloured lines; these contributions are added to give the total energy inflow .  The cumulative total energy inflow from  is balanced by the sum of the energy uptake of the Earth system  and an increase in outgoing radiation inferred from changes in the global mean surface temperature. The sum of these two terms is given for a climate feedback parameter  of 2.47, 1.23 and 0.82 W m-2 C-1, corresponding to an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 1.5C, 3.0C and 4.5C, respectively; 1.5C to 4.5C is assessed to be the likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity. The energy budget would be closed for a particular value of a if the corresponding line coincided with the total energy inflow. For clarity, all uncertainties  shown are likely ranges. 	0
If ERF were fixed, the climate system would eventually warm sufficiently that the radiative response would balance the ERF, and there would be no further change in energy storage in the climate system. However, the forcing is increasing, and the ocean's large heat capacity means that the climate system is not in radiative equilibrium and its energy content is increasing . This storage provides strong evidence of a changing climate. The majority of this additional heat is in the upper 700 m of the ocean, but there is also warming in the deep and abyssal ocean. The associated thermal expansion of the ocean has contributed about 40% of the observed sea level rise since 1970. A small amount of additional heat has been used to warm the continents, warm and melt glacial and sea ice and warm the atmosphere. 	0
The evidence for the retreat of glaciers due to warming and moisture change is now more complete than at the time of AR4. There is high confidence in the estimates of observed mass loss and the estimates of natural variations and internal variability from long-term glacier records. Based on these factors and our understanding of glacier response to climatic drivers there is high confidence that a substantial part of the mass loss of glaciers is likely due to human influence. It is likely that there has been an anthropogenic component to observed reductions in NH snow cover since 1970. 	0
TFE.5 | Irreversibility and Abrupt Change A number of components or phenomena within the climate system have been proposed as potentially exhibiting threshold behaviour. Crossing such thresholds can lead to an abrupt or irreversible transition into a different state of the climate system or some of its components. Abrupt climate change is defined in this IPCC Fifth Assessment Report  as a large-scale change in the climate system that takes place over a few decades or less, persists  for at least a few decades and causes substantial disruptions in human and natural systems. There is information on potential consequences of some abrupt changes, but in general there is low confidence and little consensus on the likelihood of such events over the 21st century. Examples of components susceptible to such abrupt change are the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation , clathrate methane release, tropical and boreal forest dieback, disappearance of summer sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, long-term drought and monsoonal circulation. 	0
A change is said to be irreversible if the recovery time scale from this state due to natural processes is significantly longer than the time it takes for the system to reach this perturbed state. Such behaviour may arise because the time scales for perturbations and recovery processes are different, or because climate change may persist due to the long residence time of a carbon dioxide  perturbation in the atmosphere . Whereas changes in Arctic Ocean summer sea ice extent, long-term droughts and monsoonal circulation are assessed to be reversible within years to decades, tropical or boreal forest dieback may be reversible only within centuries. Changes in clathrate methane and permafrost carbon release, Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet collapse may be irreversible during millennia after the causal perturbation. Potential Irreversibility of Changes in Permafrost, Methane Clathrates and Forests In a warming climate, permafrost thawing may induce decomposition of carbon accumulated in frozen soils which could persist for hundreds to thousands of years, leading to an increase of atmospheric CO2 and/or methane  	0
concentrations. The existing modelling studies of permafrost carbon balance under future warming that take into account at least some of the essential permafrost-related processes do not yield consistent results, beyond the fact that present-day permafrost will become a net emitter of carbon during the 21st century under plausible future warming scenarios . This also reflects an insufficient understanding of the relevant soil processes during and after permafrost thaw, including processes leading to stabilization of unfrozen soil carbon, and precludes any quantitative assessment of the amplitude of irreversible changes in the climate system potentially related to permafrost degassing and associated feedbacks. Abrupt change in ice sheet outflow to the sea may be caused by unstable retreat of the grounding line in regions where the bedrock is below sea level and slopes downwards towards the interior of the ice sheet.

Several new attribution studies have found a detectable anthropogenic influence in the observed increased frequency of warm days and nights and decreased frequency of cold days and nights. Since the AR4 and SREX, there is new evidence for detection of human influence on extremely warm daytime temperature and there is new evidence that the influence of anthropogenic forcing may be detected separately from the influence of natural forcing at global scales and in some continental and sub-continental regions. This strengthens the conclusions from both AR4 and SREX, and it is now very likely that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to the observed changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human influence has significantly increased the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations. See TFE.9 and TFE.9, Table 1 for a summary of the assessment of extreme weather and climate events. 	0
Although the AR4 concluded that it is more likely than not that anthropogenic influence has contributed to an increased risk of drought in the second half of the 20th century, an updated assessment of the observational evidence indicates that the AR4 conclusions regarding global increasing trends in hydrological droughts since the 1970s are no longer supported. Owing to the low confidence in observed large-scale trends in dryness combined with difficulties in distinguishing decadal-scale variability in drought from long-term climate change, there is now low confidence in the attribution of changes in drought over global land since the mid-20th century to human influence. 	0
Taking a longer term perspective shows the substantial role played by external forcings in driving climate variability on hemispheric scales in pre-industrial times . It is very unlikely that NH temperature variations from 1400 to 1850 can be explained by internal variability alone. There is medium confidence that external forcing contributed to NH temperature variability from 850 to 1400 and that external forcing contributed to European temperature variations over the last 5 centuries. The evidence is stronger that observed changes in the climate system can now be attributed to human activities on global and regional scales in many components . Observational uncertainty has been explored much more thoroughly than previously, and fingerprints of human influence have been deduced from a new generation of climate models. There is improved understanding of ocean changes, including salinity changes, that are consistent with large scale intensification of the water cycle predicted by climate models. The changes in near surface temperatures, free atmosphere temperatures, ocean temperatures and NH snow cover and sea ice extent, when taken together, show not	0
just global mean changes, but also distinctive regional patterns consistent with the expected fingerprints of change from anthropogenic forcings and the expected responses from volcanic eruptions . Over every continent except Antarctica, anthropogenic influence has likely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century . It is likely that there has been a significant anthropogenic contribution to the very substantial warming in Arctic land surface temperatures over the past 50 years. For Antarctica large observational uncertainties result in low confidence that anthropogenic influence has contributed to observed warming averaged over available stations. Detection and attribution at regional	0
Globally, there is low confidence in attribution of changes in tropical cyclone activity to human influence. This is due to insufficient observational evidence, lack of physical understanding of the links between anthropogenic drivers of climate and tropical cyclone activity, and the low level of agreement between studies as to the relative importance of internal variability, and anthropogenic and natural forcings. In the North Atlantic region there is medium confidence that a reduction in aerosol forcing over the North Atlantic has contributed at least in part to the observed increase in tropical cyclone activity there since the 1970s. There remains substantial disagreement on the relative importance of internal variability, WMGHG forcing and aerosols for this observed trend. 	0

For example, data coverage of Antarctica never goes above 50% of the land area of the continent. For ocean heat content and sea ice panels the solid observations line is where the coverage of data is good and higher in quality, and the dashed line is where the data coverage is only adequate.

There is very high confidence that models reproduce the general features of the global and annual mean surface temperature changes over the historical period, including the warming in the second half of the 20th century and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions. Most simulations of the historical period do not reproduce the observed reduction in global mean surface warming trend over the last 10 to 15 years . There is medium confidence that the trend difference between models and observations during 1998-2012 is to a substantial degree caused by internal variability, with possible contributions from forcing inadequacies in models and some models overestimating the response to increasing greenhouse gas forcing. Most, though not all, models overestimate the observed warming trend in the tropical troposphere over the last 30 years, and tend to underestimate the long-term lowerstratospheric cooling trend.  75	0
Climate models are based on physical principles, and they reproduce many important elements of observed climate. Both aspects contribute to our confidence in the models' suitability for their application in detection and attribution studies  and for quantitative future predictions and projections . There is increasing evidence that some elements of observed variability or trends are well correlated with inter-model differences in model projections for quantities such as Arctic summer sea ice trends, the snow-albedo feedback, and the carbon loss from tropical land. However, there is still no universal strategy for transferring a model's past performance to a relative weight of this model in a multi-model-ensemble mean of climate projections.  Trends ArctSIE	0
Box TS.4, Figure1 | Summary of how well the current-generation climate models simulate important features of the climate of the 20th century. Confidence in the assessment increases towards the right as suggested by the increasing strength of shading. Model quality increases from bottom to top.

There have been a number of improvements since the AR4, and some some modelled quantities are not better simulated. The major climate quantities are listed in this summary and none shows degradation. The assessment is based mostly on the multi-model mean, not excluding that deviations for individual models could exist.

Box TS.5, Figure 1 illustrates the comparison between the last millennium Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 3 /CMIP5 simulations and reconstructions, together with the associated solar, volcanic and WMGHG RFs. For average annual NH temperatures, the period 1983-2012 was very likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years  and likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years . This is supported by comparison of instrumental temperatures with multiple reconstructions from a variety of proxy data and statistical methods, and is consistent with AR4. In response to solar, volcanic and anthropogenic radiative changes, climate models simulate multi-decadal temperature changes in the last 1200 years in the NH that are generally consistent in magnitude and timing with reconstructions, within their uncertainty ranges. Continental-scale temperature reconstructions show, with high confidence, multi-decadal periods during the Medieval Climate Anomaly  that were in some regions as warm as the mid-20th century and in others as warm as in the late 20th century. With high confidence, these regional warm periods were not as synchronous across regions as the warming since the mid-20th century. Based on the comparison between reconstructions and simulations, there is high confidence that not only external orbital, solar and volcanic forcing but also internal variability contributed substantially to the spatial pattern and timing of surface temperature changes between the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age . However, there is only very low confidence in quantitative estimates of their relative contributions. It is very unlikely that NH temperature variations from 1400 to 1850 can be explained by internal variability alone. There is medium confidence that external forcing contributed to Northern Hemispheric temperature variability from 850 to 1400 and that external forcing contributed to European temperature variations over the last 5 centuries. 	0

Projections of changes in the climate system are made using a hierarchy of climate models ranging from simple climate models, to models of intermediate complexity, to comprehensive climate models, and Earth System Models . These models simulate changes based on a set of scenarios of anthropogenic forcings. A new set of scenarios, the Representative Concentration Pathways , was used for the new climate model simulations carried out under the framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  of the World Climate Research Programme. A large number of comprehensive climate models and ESMs have participated in CMIP5, whose results form the core of the climate system projections. This section summarizes the assessment of these climate change projections. First, future forcing and scenarios are presented. The following subsections then address various aspects of projections of global and regional climate change, including near-term  and long-term  projections in the atmosphere, ocean and cryosphere; projections of carbon and other biogeochemical	0
In this assessment report a series of new RCPs are used that largely replace the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios  scenarios . They produce a range of responses from ongoing warming, to approximately stabilized forcing, to a stringent mitigation scenario  that stabilizes and then slowly reduces the RF after mid-21st century. In contrast to the AR4, the climate change from the RCP scenarios in the AR5 is framed as a combination of adaptation and mitigation. Mitigation actions starting now in the various RCP scenarios do not produce discernibly different climate change outcomes for the next 30 years or so, whereas long-term climate change after mid-century is appreciably different across the RCPs. 	0
Box TS.6 | The New Representative Concentration Pathway Scenarios and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Models Future anthropogenic emissions of GHGs, aerosol particles and other forcing agents such as land use change are dependent on socioeconomic factors, and may be affected by global geopolitical agreements to control those emissions to achieve mitigation. AR4 made extensive use of the SRES scenarios that do not include additional climate initiatives, which means that no scenarios were available that explicitly assume implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  or the emissions targets of the Kyoto Protocol. However, GHG emissions are directly affected by non-climate change policies designed for a wide range of other purposes. The SRES scenarios were developed using a sequential approach, that is, socioeconomic factors fed into emissions scenarios, which were then used in simple climate models to determine concentrations of GHGs, and other agents required to drive the more complex AOGCMs. In this report, outcomes of climate simulations that use new scenarios  referred to as RCPs are assessed. These RCPs represent a larger set of mitigation scenarios and were selected to have different targets in terms of radiative forcing at 2100 . The scenarios should be considered plausible and illustrative, and do not have probabilities attached to them. 	0
The assessment of the mean values and ranges of global mean temperature changes in AR4 would not have been substantially different if the CMIP5 models had been used in that report. The differences in global temperature projections can largely be attributed to the different scenarios. The global mean temperature response simulated by CMIP3 and CMIP5 models is very similar, both in the mean and the model range, transiently and in equilibrium. The range of temperature change across all scenarios is wider because the RCPs include a strong mitigation scenario  that had no equivalent among the SRES scenarios used in CMIP3. For each scenario, the 5 to 95% range of the CMIP5 projections is obtained by approximating the CMIP5 distributions by a normal distribution with same mean and standard deviation and assessed as being likely for projections of global temperature change for the end of the 21st century. Probabilistic projections with simpler models calibrated to span the range of equilibrium climate sensitivity assessed by the AR4 provide uncertainty ranges that are consistent with those from CMIP5. In AR4 the uncertainties in global temperature projections were found to be approximately constant when expressed as a fraction of the model mean warming . For the higher RCPs, the uncertainty is now estimated to be smaller than with the AR4 method for long-term climate change, because the carbon cycle-climate feedbacks are not relevant for the concentration-driven RCP projections . When forced with RCP8.5, CO2 emissions, as opposed to the RCP8.5 CO2 concentrations, CMIP5 ESMs with interactive carbon cycle simulate, on average, a 50  ppm  larger atmospheric CO2 concentration and 0.2C larger global surface temperature increase by 2100. For the low RCPs the fractional uncertainty is larger because internal variability and non-CO2 forcings make a larger relative contribution to the total uncertainty. 	0
Box TS.6, Figure 1 | Patterns of temperature  and percent precipitation change  for the CMIP3 models average  and CMIP5 models average , scaled by the corresponding global average temperature changes. The patterns are computed in both cases by taking the difference between the averages over the last 20 years of the 21st century experiments  and the last 20 years of the historic experiments  and rescaling each difference by the corresponding change in global average temperature. This is done first for each individual model, then the results are averaged across models. Stippling indicates a measure of significance of the difference between the two corresponding patterns obtained by a bootstrap exercise. Two subsets of the pooled set of CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensemble members of the same size as the original ensembles, but without distinguishing CMIP3 from CMIP5 members, were randomly sampled 500 times. For each random sample the corresponding patterns and their difference are computed, then the true difference is compared, grid-point by grid-point, to the distribution of the bootstrapped differences, and only grid-points at which the value of the difference falls in the tails of the bootstrapped distribution  are stippled. 	0
There is overall consistency between the projections of temperature and precipitation based on CMIP3 and CMIP5, both for large-scale patterns and magnitudes of change . Model agreement and confidence in projections depends on the variable and on spatial and temporal averaging, with better agreement for larger scales. Confidence is higher for temperature than for those quantities related to the water cycle or atmospheric circulation. Improved methods to quantify and display model robustness have been developed to indicate where lack of agreement across models on local trends is a result of internal variability, rather than models actually disagreeing on their forced response. Understanding of the sources and means of characterizing uncertainties in long-term large scale projections of climate change has not changed significantly since AR4, but new experiments and studies have continued to work towards a more complete and rigorous characterization. 	0
TS.5.3 If rapid reductions in sulphate aerosol are undertaken for improving air quality or as part of decreasing fossil-fuel CO2 emissions, then there is medium confidence that this could lead to rapid near-term warming. There is evidence that accompanying controls on CH4 emissions would offset some of this sulphate-induced warming, although the cooling from CH4 mitigation will emerge more slowly than the warming from sulphate mitigation due to the different time scales over which atmospheric concentrations of these substances decrease in response to decreases in emissions. Although removal of black carbon aerosol could also counter warming associated with sulphate removal, uncertainties are too large to constrain the net sign of the global temperature response to black carbon emission reductions, which depends on reduction of co-emitted  aerosols and on aerosol indirect effects. 	0
TFE.6 | Climate Sensitivity and Feedbacks The description of climate change as a response to a forcing that is amplified by feedbacks goes back many decades. The concepts of radiative forcing  and climate feedbacks continue to be refined, and limitations are now better understood; for instance, feedbacks may be much faster than the surface warming, feedbacks depend on the type of forcing agent  vs. solar forcing), or may have intrinsic time scales  of several centuries to millennia. The analysis of physical feedbacks in models and from observations remains a powerful framework that provides constraints on transient future warming for different scenarios, on climate sensitivity and, combined with estimates of carbon cycle feedbacks , determines the GHG emissions that are compatible with climate stabilization or targets . 	0
Newer studies of constraints on ECS are based on the observed warming since pre-industrial, analysed using simple and intermediate complexity models, improved statistical methods and several different and newer data sets. Together with paleoclimate constraints but without considering the CMIP based evidence these studies show ECS is likely between 1.5C to 4.5C  and extremely unlikely less than 1.0C. Based on the combined evidence from observed climate change including the observed 20th century warming, climate models, feedback analysis and paleoclimate, as discussed above, ECS is likely in the range 1.5C to 4.5C with high confidence. ECS is positive, extremely unlikely	0
less than 1C , and very unlikely greater than 6C . The tails of the ECS distribution are now better understood. Multiple lines of evidence provide high confidence that an ECS value less than 1C is extremely unlikely. The upper limit of the likely range is unchanged compared to AR4. The lower limit of the likely range of 1.5C is less than the lower limit of 2C in AR4. This change reflects the evidence from new studies of observed temperature change, using the extended records in atmosphere and ocean. These studies suggest a best fit to the observed surface and ocean warming for ECS values in the lower part of the likely range. Note that these studies are not purely observational, because they require an estimate of the 1.5 response to RF from models. In addition, the uncertainty in ocean heat uptake remains substantial. Accounting for short-term variability in simple models remains challenging, and it is important not to give undue weight to 1 any short time period which might be strongly affected by internal variability. On the other hand, AOGCMs with observed climatology with ECS values in the upper Black histogram CMIP5 models part of the 1.5 to 4.5C range show very good agreeDashed lines 0.5 AR4 studies ment with observed climatology, but the simulation of key feedbacks like clouds remains challenging in those models.

On time scales of many centuries and longer, additional feedbacks with their own intrinsic time scales  may become important but are not usually modelled in AOGCMs. The resulting equilibrium temperature response to a doubling of CO2 on millennial time scales or Earth system sensitivity is less well constrained but likely to be larger than ECS, implying that lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations are compatible with limiting warming to below a given temperature level. These slow feedbacks are less likely to be proportional to global mean temperature change, implying that Earth system sensitivity changes over time. Estimates of Earth system sensitivity are also difficult to relate to climate sensitivity of the current climate state. For scenarios of increasing RF, TCR is a more informative indicator of future climate change than ECS. This assessment concludes with high confidence that the TCR is likely in the range 1C to 2.5C, close to the estimated 5 to 95% range of CMIP5 , is positive and extremely unlikely greater than 3C. As with the ECS, this is an expert-assessed range, supported by several different and partly independent lines of evidence, each based on multiple studies, models and data sets. TCR is estimated from the observed global changes in surface temperature, ocean heat uptake and RF including detection/attribution studies identifying the response patterns to increasing GHG concentrations, and the results of CMIP3 and CMIP5. Estimating TCR suffers from fewer difficulties in terms of state- or time-dependent feedbacks, and is less affected by uncertainty as to how much energy is taken up by the 	0
ocean. Unlike ECS, the ranges of TCR estimated from the observed warming and from AOGCMs agree well, increasing our confidence in the assessment of uncertainties in projections over the 21st century. The assessed ranges of ECS and TCR are largely consistent with the observed warming, the estimated forcing and the projected future warming. In contrast to AR4, no best estimate for ECS is given because of a lack of agreement on the best estimate across lines of evidence and studies and an improved understanding of the uncertainties in estimates based on the observed warming. Climate models with ECS values in the upper part of the likely range show very good agreement with observed climatology, whereas estimates derived from observed climate change tend to best fit the observed surface and ocean warming for ECS values in the lower part of the likely range. In estimates based on the observed warming the most likely value is sensitive to observational and model uncertainties, internal climate variability and to assumptions about the prior distribution of ECS. In addition, "best estimate" and "most likely value" are defined in various ways in different studies. TS	0
Near-term decadal climate prediction provides information not available from existing seasonal to interannual  predictions or from long-term  climate change projections. Prediction efforts on seasonal to interannual time scales require accurate estimates of the initial climate state with less focus extended to changes in external forcing12, whereas long-term climate projections rely more heavily on estimations of external forcing with little reliance on the initial state of internal variability. Estimates of near-term climate depend on the committed warming  the time evolution of internally generated climate variability, and the future path of external forcing. Near-term predictions out to about a decade  depend more heavily on an accurate depiction of the internally generated climate variability. Retrospective prediction experiments have been used to assess forecast quality. There is high confidence that the retrospective prediction experiments for forecast periods of up to 10 years exhibit positive skill	0
when verified against observations over large regions of the planet and of the global mean. Observation-based initialization of the forecasts contributes to the skill of predictions of annual mean temperature for the first couple of years and to the skill of predictions of the GMST and the temperature over the North Atlantic, regions of the South Pacific and the tropical Indian Ocean up to 10 years  partly due to a correction of the forced response. Probabilistic temperature predictions are statistically reliable  owing to the correct representation of global trends, but still unreliable at the regional scale when probabilities are computed from the multi-model ensemble. Predictions initialized over 2000-2005 improve estimates of the recent global mean temperature hiatus. Predictions of precipitation over continental areas with large forced trends also exhibit positive skill. 	0

Higher concentrations of GHGs and lower amounts of sulphate aerosol lead to greater warming. In the near-term, differences in global mean surface air temperature across RCP scenarios for a single climate model are typically smaller than across climate models for a single RCP scenario. In 2030, the CMIP5 ensemble median values for global mean temperature differ by at most 0.2C between the RCP scenarios, whereas the model spread  for each RCP is around 0.4C. The inter-scenario spread increases in time and by 2050 is comparable to the model spread. Regionally, the largest differences in surface air temperature between RCP scenarios are found in the Arctic. 	0
The spatial patterns of near-term warming projected by the CMIP5 models following the RCP scenarios  are broadly consistent with the AR4. It is very likely that anthropogenic warming of surface air temperature over the next few decades will proceed more rapidly over land areas than over oceans, and it is very likely that the anthropogenic warming over the Arctic in winter will be greater than the global mean warming, consistent with the AR4. Relative to background levels of internally generated variability there is high confidence that the anthropogenic warming relative to the reference period is expected to be larger in the tropics and subtropics than in mid-latitudes. 	0

TS.5.4.6 Projected Near-term Changes in the Cryosphere A nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean  in September is likely before mid-century under RCP8.5 . This assessment is based on a subset of models that most closely reproduce the climatological mean state and 1979 to 2012 trend of Arctic sea ice cover. It is very likely that there will be further shrinking and thinning of Arctic sea ice cover, and decreases of northern high-latitude spring time snow cover and near surface permafrost as GMST rises . There is low confidence in projected near-term decreases in the Antarctic sea ice extent and volume. 	0
TS.5.4.7 Possibility of Near-term Abrupt Changes in Climate TS.5.4.4 Projected Near-term Changes in Atmospheric Circulation Internally generated climate variability and multiple RF agents  will all contribute to near-term changes in the atmospheric circulation. For example, it is likely that the annual mean Hadley Circulation and the SH mid-latitude westerlies will shift poleward, while it is likely that the projected recovery of stratospheric ozone and increases in GHG concentrations will have counteracting impacts on the width of the Hadley Circulation and the meridional position of the SH storm track. Therefore it is unlikely that they will continue to expand poleward as rapidly as in recent decades. 	0
TS.5.4.8 Projected Near-term Changes in Air Quality The range in projections of air quality  is driven primarily by emissions , rather than by physical climate change . The response of air quality to climate-driven changes is more uncertain than the response to emission-driven changes . Globally, warming decreases background surface O3 . High CH4 levels  can offset this decrease, raising 2100 background surface O3 on average by about 8 ppb  relative to scenarios with small CH4 changes  . On a continental scale, projected air pollution levels are lower under the new RCP scenarios than under the SRES scenarios because the SRES did not incorporate air quality legislation . Observational and modelling evidence indicates that, all else being equal, locally higher surface temperatures in polluted regions will trigger regional feedbacks in chemistry and local emissions that will increase peak levels of O3 and PM2.5 . Local emissions combined with background levels and with meteorological conditions conducive to the formation and accumulation of pollution are known to produce extreme pollution episodes on local and regional scales. There is low confidence in projecting changes in meteorological blocking associated with these extreme episodes. For PM2.5, climate change may alter natural aerosol sources (wildfires, wind-lofted	0
The 5 to 95% range of CMIP5 for global mean temperature change is also assessed as likely for mid-21st century, but only with medium confidence. With respect to 1850-1900 mean conditions, global temperatures averaged in the period 2081-2100 are projected to likely exceed 1.5C above 1850-1900 values for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5  and are likely to exceed 2C above 1850-1900 values for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 . Temperature change above 2C relative to 1850-1900 under RCP2.6 is unlikely . Warming above 4C by 2081-2100 is unlikely in all RCPs  except for RCP8.5, where it is about as likely as not . 	0

The 1.64 standard deviation range based on the 20 yr averages 2081-2100, relative to 1986-2005, are interpreted as likely changes for the end of the 21st century. Discontinuities at 2100 are due to different numbers of models performing the extension runs beyond the 21st century and have no physical meaning. Numbers in the same colours as the lines indicate the number of different models contributing to the different time periods. Maps: Multi-model ensemble average of annual mean surface air temperature change  for 2016-2035 and 2081-2100, for RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5. Hatching indicates regions where the multi-model mean signal is less than one standard deviation of internal variability. Stippling indicates regions where the multi-model mean signal is greater than two standard deviations of internal variability and where 90% of the models agree on the sign of change.

Based on the CMIP5 ensemble; anomalies calculated with respect to 1986-2005. Using HadCRUT4 and its uncertainty estimate , the observed warming to the reference period 1986-2005 is 0.61  C from 1850-1900, and 0.11  C from 1980-1999, the reference period for projections used in AR4. Likely ranges have not been assessed here with respect to earlier reference periods because methods are not generally available in the literature for combining the uncertainties in models and observations. Adding projected and observed changes does not account for potential effects of model biases compared to observations, and for natural internal variability during the observational reference period. 	0
Based on 21 CMIP5 models; anomalies calculated with respect to 1986-2005. Where CMIP5 results were not available for a particular AOGCM and scenario, they were estimated as explained in Chapter 13, Table 13.5. The contributions from ice sheet rapid dynamical change and anthropogenic land water storage are treated as having uniform probability distributions, and as largely independent of scenario. This treatment does not imply that the contributions concerned will not depend on the scenario followed, only that the current state of knowledge does not permit a quantitative assessment of the dependence. Based on current understanding, only the collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause global mean sea level to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. There is medium confidence that this additional contribution would not exceed several tenths of a metre of sea level rise during the 21st century.	0
Calculated from projections as 5-95% model ranges. These ranges are then assessed to be likely ranges after accounting for additional uncertainties or different levels of confidence in models. For projections of global mean surface temperature change in 2046-2065 confidence is medium, because the relative importance of natural internal variability, and uncertainty in non-greenhouse gas forcing and response, are larger than for 2081-2100. The likely ranges for 2046-2065 do not take into account the possible influence of factors that lead to the assessed range for near-term  global mean surface temperature change that is lower than the 5-95% model range, because the influence of these factors on longer term projections has not been quantified due to insufficient scientific understanding. 	0
It is virtually certain that, in most places, there will be more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes as global mean temperatures increase. These changes are expected for events defined as extremes on both daily and seasonal time scales. Increases in the frequency, duration and magnitude of hot extremes along with heat stress are expected; however, occasional cold winter extremes will continue to occur. Twenty-year return values of low-temperature events are projected to increase at a rate greater than winter mean temperatures in most regions, with the largest changes in the return values of low temperatures at high latitudes. Twenty-year return values for hightemperature events are projected to increase at a rate similar to or greater than the rate of increase of summer mean temperatures in most regions. Under RCP8.5 it is likely that, in most land regions, a current 20-year high-temperature event will occur more frequently by the end of the 21st century  and a current 20-year low-temperature event will become exceedingly rare . 	0
Mean sea level pressure is projected to decrease in high latitudes and increase in the mid-latitudes as global temperatures rise. In the tropics, the Hadley and Walker Circulations are likely to slow down. Poleward shifts in the mid-latitude jets of about 1 to 2 degrees latitude are likely at the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 in both hemispheres , with weaker shifts in the NH. In austral summer, the additional influence of stratospheric ozone recovery in the SH opposes changes due to GHGs there, though the net response varies strongly across models and scenarios. Substantial uncertainty and thus low confidence remains in projecting changes in NH storm tracks, especially for the North Atlantic basin. The Hadley Cell is likely to widen, which translates to broader tropical regions and a poleward encroachment of subtropical dry zones. In the stratosphere, the Brewer-Dobson circulation is likely to strengthen. 	0
Changes in average precipitation in a warmer world will exhibit substantial spatial variation under RCP8.5. Some regions will experience increases, other regions will experience decreases and yet others will not experience significant changes at all . There is high confidence that the contrast of annual mean precipitation between dry and wet regions and that the contrast between wet and dry seasons will increase over most of the globe as temperatures increase. The g eneral pattern of change indicates that high latitudes are very likely to experience greater amounts of precipitation due to the increased specific humidity of the warmer troposphere as well as increased transport of water vapour from the tropics by the end of this	0
Annual surface evaporation is projected to increase as global temperatures rise over most of the ocean and is projected to change over land following a similar pattern as precipitation. Decreases in annual runoff are likely in parts of southern Europe, the Middle East and southern Africa by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Increases in annual runoff are likely in the high northern latitudes corresponding to large increases in winter and spring precipitation by the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Regional to global-scale projected decreases in soil moisture and increased risk of agricultural drought are likely in presently dry regions and are projected with medium confidence by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario.

The number of CMIP5 models to calculate the multi-model mean is indicated in the upper right corner of each panel.

areas of projected decreases in evaporation include southern Africa and northwestern Africa along the Mediterranean. Soil moisture drying in the Mediterranean and southern African regions is consistent with projected changes in Hadley Circulation and increased surface temperatures, so surface drying in these regions as global temperatures increase is likely with high confidence by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. In regions where surface moistening is projected, changes are generally smaller than natural variability on the 20-year time scale. A summary of the projected changes in the water cycle from the CMIP5 models is shown in TFE.1, Figure 1. 	0
It is very likely that NH snow cover will reduce as global temperatures rise over the coming century. A retreat of permafrost extent with rising global temperatures is virtually certain. Snow cover changes result from precipitation and ablation changes, which are sometimes opposite. Projections of the NH spring snow covered area by the end of the 21st century vary between a decrease of 7  %  and 25  %  , but confidence is those numbers is only medium because snow processes in global climate models are strongly simplified. The projected changes in permafrost are a response not only to warming, but also to changes in snow cover, which exerts a control on the underlying soil. By the end of the 21st century, diagnosed near-surface permafrost area is projected to decrease by between 37%  to 81%  . 	0
It is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue shrinking and thinning year-round in the course of the 21st century as GMST rises. At the same time, in the Antarctic, a decrease in sea ice extent and volume is expected, but with low confidence. The CMIP5 multi-model projections give average reductions in Arctic sea ice extent for 2081- 2100 compared to 1986-2005 ranging from 8% for RCP2.6 to 34% for RCP8.5 in February and from 43% for RCP2.6 to 94% for RCP8.5 in September  . A nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean  in September before mid-century is likely under RCP8.5 , based on an assessment of a subset of models that most closely reproduce the climatological mean state and 1979-2012 trend of the Arctic sea ice cover. Some climate projections exhibit 5- to 10-year periods of sharp summer Arctic sea ice decline--even steeper	0
than observed over the last decade--and it is likely that such instances of rapid ice loss will occur in the future. There is little evidence in global climate models of a tipping point  in the transition from a perennially ice-covered to a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean beyond which further sea ice loss is unstoppable and irreversible. In the Antarctic, the CMIP5 multi-model mean projects a decrease in sea ice extent that ranges from 16% for RCP2.6 to 67% for RCP8.5 in February and from 8% for RCP2.6 to 30% for RCP8.5 in September for 2081-2100 compared to 1986-2005. There is, however, low confidence in those projections because of the wide inter-model spread and the inability of almost all of the available models to reproduce the overall increase of the Antarctic sea ice areal coverage observed during the satellite era. 	0

TS.5.5.6 Projected Long-term Changes in the Ocean Over the course of the 21st century, the global ocean will warm in all RCP scenarios. The strongest ocean warming is projected for the surface in subtropical and tropical regions. At greater depth the warming is projected to be most pronounced in the Southern Ocean. Best estimates of ocean warming in the top one hundred metres are about 0.6C  to 2.0C , and 0.3C  to 0.6C  at a depth of about 1 km by the end of the 21st century. For RCP4.5 by the end of the 21st century, half of the energy taken up by the ocean is in the uppermost 700 m, and 85% is in the uppermost 2000 m. Due to the long time scales of this heat transfer from the surface to depth, ocean warming will continue for centuries, even if GHG emissions are decreased or concentrations kept constant, and will result in a continued contribution to sea level rise . 	0

Dashed lines represent the historical estimates and RCP emissions calculated by the Integrated Assessment Models  used to define the RCP scenarios, solid lines and plumes show results from CMIP5 Earth System Models .  Cumulative emissions for the historical period  and 21st century  for historical estimates and RCP scenarios. Left bars are cumulative emissions from the IAMs, right bars are the CMIP5 ESMs multi-model mean estimate and dots denote individual ESM results. From the CMIP5 ESMs results, total carbon in the land-atmosphere-ocean system can be tracked and changes in this total must equal fossil fuel emissions to the system. Hence the compatible emissions are given by cumulative emissions = CA + CL + CO , while emission rate = d/dt , where CA, CL, CO are carbon stored in atmosphere, land and ocean respectively. Other sources and sinks of CO2 such as from volcanism, sedimentation or rock weathering, which are very small on centennial time scales are not considered here. 	0
TFE.7 | Carbon Cycle Perturbation and Uncertainties The natural carbon cycle has been perturbed since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution  by the anthropogenic release of carbon dioxide  to the atmosphere, virtually all from fossil fuel combustion and land use change, with a small contribution from cement production. Fossil fuel burning is a process related to energy production. Fossil fuel carbon comes from geological deposits of coal, oil and gas that were buried in the Earth crust for millions of years. Land use change CO2 emissions are related to the conversion of natural ecosystems into managed ecosystems for food, feed and timber production with CO2 being emitted from the burning of plant material or from the decomposition of dead plants and soil organic carbon. For instance when a forest is cleared, the plant material may be released to the atmosphere quickly through burning or over many years as the dead biomass and soil carbon decay on their own. 	0
The uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the ocean is primarily a response to increasing CO2 in the atmosphere. Excess atmospheric CO2 absorbed by the surface ocean or transported to the ocean through aquatic systems  gets buried in coastal sediments or transported to deep waters where it is stored for decades to centuries. The deep ocean carbon can dissolve ocean carbonate sediments to store excess CO2 on time scales of centuries to millennia. Within a 1 kyr, the remaining atmospheric fraction of the CO2 emissions will be between 15 and 40%, depending on the amount of carbon released . On geological time scales of 10 kyr or longer, additional CO2 is removed very slowly from the atmosphere by rock weathering, pulling the remaining atmospheric CO2 fraction down to 10 to 25% after 10 kyr. low agreement on the magnitude of this response, especially for the land . A key update since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report  is the introduction of nutrient dynamics in some land carbon models, in particular the limitations on plant growth imposed by nitrogen availability. There is high confidence that, at the global scale, relative to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  carbon-only Earth System 	0

Black dots represent a single model simulation and coloured bars the mean of the multi-model results, grey dots are used for models with a coupled terrestrial nitrogen cycle. The comparison with C4MIP models is for context, but these metrics are known to be variable across different scenarios and rates of change . The SRES A2 scenario is closer in rate of change to a 0.5% CO2 increase per year scenario and as such it should be expected that the CMIP5 climate-carbon sensitivity terms are comparable, but the concentration-carbon sensitivity terms are likely to be around 20% smaller for CMIP5 than for C4MIP due to lags in the ability of the land and ocean to respond to higher rates of CO2 increase. This dependence on scenario reduces confidence in any quantitative statements of how CMIP5 carbon cycle feedbacks differ from C4MIP. 	0
With very high confidence, ocean carbon uptake of anthropogenic CO2 emissions will continue under all four Representative Concentration Pathways  through to 2100, with higher uptake corresponding to higher concentration pathways. The future evolution of the land carbon uptake is much more uncertain, with a majority of models projecting a continued net carbon uptake under all RCPs, but with some models simulating a net loss of carbon by the land due to the combined effect of climate change and land use change. In view of the large spread of model results and incomplete process representation, there is low confidence on the magnitude of modelled future land carbon changes. 	0
Box TS.7 | Climate Geoengineering Methods Geoengineering is defined as the deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth system to counter undesirable impacts of climate change on the planet. Carbon Dioxide Reduction  aims to slow or perhaps reverse projected increases in the future atmospheric CO2 concentrations, accelerating the natural removal of atmospheric CO2 and increasing the storage of carbon in land, ocean and geological reservoirs. Solar Radiation Management  aims to counter the warming associated with increasing GHG concentrations by reducing the amount of sunlight absorbed by the climate system. A related technique seeks to deliberately decrease the greenhouse effect in the climate system by altering high-level cloudiness. 	0
SRM remains unimplemented and untested but, if realizable, could offset a global temperature rise and some of its effects. There is medium confidence that SRM through stratospheric aerosol injection is scalable to counter the RF and some of the climate effects expected from a twofold increase in CO2 concentration. There is no consensus on whether a similarly large RF could be achieved from cloud brightening SRM due to insufficient understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions. It does not appear that land albedo change SRM could produce a large RF. Limited literature on other SRM methods precludes their assessment. 	0
TS.5.7.1 Projections of Global Mean Sea Level Change for the 21st Century GMSL rise for 2081-2100  for the RCPs will likely be in the 5 to 95% ranges derived from CMIP5 climate projections in combination with process-based models of glacier and ice sheet surface mass balance, with possible ice sheet dynamical changes assessed from the published literature. These likely ranges are 0.26 to 0.55 m , 0.32 to 0.63 m , 0.33 to 0.63 m  and 0.45 to 0.82 m   . For RCP8.5 the range at 2100 is 0.52 to 0.98 m. The central projections for GMSL rise in all scenarios lie within a range of 0.05 m until the middle of the century, when they begin to diverge; by the late 21st century, they have a spread of 0.25 m. Although RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 are very 98	0
similar at the end of the century, RCP4.5 has a greater rate of rise earlier in the century than RCP6.0. GMSL rise depends on the pathway of CO2 emissions, not only on the cumulative total; reducing emissions earlier rather than later, for the same cumulative total, leads to a larger mitigation of sea level rise. Confidence in the projected likely ranges comes from the consistency of process-based models with observations and physical understanding. The basis for higher projections has been considered and it has been concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to evaluate the probability of specific levels above the likely range. Based on current understanding, only the collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause GMSL to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. There is a lack of consensus on the probability for such a collapse, and the potential additional contribution to GMSL rise cannot be precisely quantified,	0
Semi-empirical models are designed to reproduce the observed sea level record over their period of calibration, but do not attribute sea level rise to its individual physical components. For RCPs, some semiempirical models project a range that overlaps the process-based likely range while others project a median and 95-percentile that are about twice as large as the process-based models. In nearly every case, the semi-empirical model 95th percentile is higher than the process-based likely range. For 2081-2100  under RCP4.5, semi-empirical models give median projections in the range 0.56 to 0.97 m, and their 95th percentiles extend to about 1.2 m. This difference implies either that there is some contribution which is presently	0
There is medium confidence in the ability to model future rapid changes in ice sheet dynamics on decadal time scales. At the time of the AR4, scientific understanding was not sufficient to allow an assessment of the possibility of such changes. Since the publication of the AR4, there has been substantial progress in understanding the relevant processes as well as in developing new ice sheet models that are capable of simulating them. However, the published literature as yet provides only a partially sufficient basis for making projections related to particular scenarios. In our projections of GMSL rise by 2081-2100, the likely range from rapid changes in ice outflow is 0.03 to 0.20 m from the two ice sheets combined, and its inclusion is the most important reason why the projections are greater than those given in the AR4. 	0

The contributions from ice sheets include the contributions from ice sheet rapid dynamical change, which are also shown separately. The contributions from ice sheet rapid dynamics and anthropogenic land water storage are treated as having uniform probability distributions, and as independent of scenario . This treatment does not imply that the contributions concerned will not depend on the scenario followed, only that the current state of knowledge does not permit a quantitative assessment of the dependence. See discussion in Sections 13.5.1 and 13.5.3 and Supplementary Material for methods. Based on current understanding, only the collapse of the marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause GMSL to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. This potential additional contribution cannot be precisely quantified but there is medium confidence that it would not exceed several tenths of a metre during the 21st century. 	0

unidentified or underestimated by process-based models, or that the projections of semi-empirical models are overestimates. Making projections with a semi-empirical model assumes that sea level change in the future will have the same relationship as it has had in the past to RF or global mean temperature change. This may not hold if potentially nonlinear physical processes do not scale in the future in ways which can be calibrated from the past. There is no consensus in the scientific community about the reliability of semi-empirical model projections, and confidence in them is assessed to be low. 	0
TS.5.7.2 Projections of Global Mean Sea Level Change Beyond 2100 It is virtually certain that GMSL rise will continue beyond 2100. The few available model results that go beyond 2100 indicate global mean sea level rise above the pre-industrial level  by 2300 to be less than 1 m for a RF that corresponds to CO2 concentrations that peak and decline and remain below 500 ppm, as in the scenario RCP2.6. For a RF that corresponds to a CO2 concentration that is above 700 ppm but below 1500 ppm, as in the scenario RCP8.5, the projected rise is 1 m to more than 3 m . Sea level rise due to ocean thermal expansion will continue for centuries to millennia. The amount of ocean thermal expansion increases with global warming . The glacier contribution decreases over time as their volume (currently 100	0
The available evidence indicates that global warming greater than a certain threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a GMSL rise of about 7 m. Studies with fixed present-day ice sheet topography indicate the threshold is greater than 2C but less than 4C of GMST rise with respect to pre-industrial . The one study with a dynamical ice sheet suggests the threshold is greater than about 1C  global mean warming with respect to pre-industrial. Considering the present state of scientific uncertainty, a likely range cannot be quantified. The complete loss of the ice sheet is not inevitable because this would take a millennium or more; if temperatures decline before the ice sheet is eliminated, the ice sheet might regrow. However, some part of the mass loss might be irreversible, depending on the duration and degree of exceedance of the threshold, because the ice sheet may have multiple steady states, due to its interaction with its regional climate. 	0
TS.5.7.3 Projections of Regional Sea Level Change Regional sea level will change due to dynamical ocean circulation changes, changes in the heat content of the ocean, mass redistribution in the entire Earth system and changes in atmospheric pressure. Ocean dynamical change results from changes in wind and buoyancy forcing , associated changes in the circulation, and redistribution of heat and freshwater. Over time scales longer than a few days, regional sea level also adjusts nearly isostatically to regional changes in sea level atmospheric pressure relative to its mean over the ocean. Ice sheet mass loss , glacier mass loss and changes in terrestrial hydrology cause water mass redistribution among the cryosphere, the land and the oceans, giving rise to distinctive regional changes in the solid Earth, Earth rotation and the gravity field. In some coastal locations, changes in the hydrological cycle, ground subsidence associated with anthropogenic activity,	0
TS.5.7.4 Projections of Change in Sea Level Extremes and Waves During the 21st Century It is very likely that there will be a significant increase in the occurrence of future sea level extremes by the end of the 21st century, with a likely increase in the early 21st century . This increase will primarily be the result of an increase in mean sea level , with extreme return periods decreasing by at least an order of magnitude in some regions by the end of the 21st century. There is low confidence in region-specific projections of storminess and associated storm surges. 	0
TFE.8 | Climate Targets and Stabilization The concept of stabilization is strongly linked to the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , which is `to achieve  stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system'. Recent policy discussions focused on limits to a global temperature increase, rather than to greenhouse gas  concentrations, as climate targets in the context of the UNFCCC objectives. The most widely discussed is that of 2C, that is, to limit global temperature increase relative to pre-industrial times to below 2C, but targets other than 2C have been proposed  concentration of 350 ppm). Climate targets generally mean avoiding a warming beyond a predefined threshold. Climate impacts, however, are geographically diverse and sector specific, and no objective threshold defines when dangerous interference is reached. Some changes may be delayed or irreversible, and some impacts could be beneficial. It is thus not possible to define a single critical objective threshold without value judgements and without assumptions on how to aggregate current and future costs and benefits. This TFE does not advocate or defend any threshold or objective, nor does it judge the economic or political feasibility of such goals, but assesses, based on the current understanding of climate and carbon cycle feedbacks, the climate projections following the Representative Concentration Pathways  in the context of climate targets, and the implications of different long-term temperature stabilization objectives on allowed carbon emissions. Further below it is highlighted that temperature stabilization does not necessarily imply stabilization of the entire Earth system. 	0
Temperature targets imply an upper limit on the total radiative forcing . Differences in RF between the four RCP scenarios are relatively small up to 2030, but become very large by the end of the 21st century and dominated by CO2 forcing. Consequently, in the near term, global mean surface temperatures  are projected to continue to rise at a similar rate for the four RCP scenarios. Around the mid-21st century, the rate of global warming begins to be more strongly dependent on the scenario. By the end of the 21st century, global mean temperatures will be warmer than present day under all the RCPs, global temperature change being largest  in the highest RCP8.5 and significantly lower in RCP2.6, particularly after about 2050 when global surface temperature response stabilizes  . The total amount of anthropogenic CO2 released in the atmosphere since pre-industrial  is a good indicator of the atmospheric CO2 concentration and hence of the global warming response. The ratio of GMST change to total cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions is relatively constant over time and independent of the scenario. This near-linear relationship between total CO2 emissions and global temperature change makes it possible to define a new quantity, the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emission , as the transient GMST change for a given amount of cumulated anthropogenic CO2 emissions, usually 1000 PgC . TCRE is model dependent, as it is a function of the cumulative CO2 airborne fraction and the transient climate response, both quantities varying significantly across models. Taking into account the available information from multiple lines of evidence , the near linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and peak global mean temperature is 	0
The climate system has multiple time scales, ranging from annual to multi-millennial, associated with different thermal and carbon reservoirs. These long time scales induce a commitment warming `already in the pipe-line'. Stabilization of the forcing would not lead to an instantaneous stabilization of the warming. For the RCP scenarios and their extensions to 2300, the fraction of realized warming, at that time when RF stabilizes, would be about 75 to 85% of the equilibrium warming. For a 1% yr-1 CO2 increase to 2 x CO2 or 4 x CO2 and constant forcing thereafter, the fraction of realized warming would be much smaller, about 40 to 70% at the time when the forcing is kept constant. Owing to the long time scales in the deep ocean, full equilibrium is reached only after hundreds to thousands of years. 	0

Note that the fraction of models cannot be interpreted as a probability. The budgets are derived from the RCP8.5 runs, with relative high non-CO2 forcing over the 21st century. If non-CO2 are significantly reduced, the CO2 emissions compatible with a specific temperature limit might be slightly higher, but only to a very limited degree, as illustrated by the other coloured lines in , which assume significantly lower non-CO2 forcing. Further detail regarding the related Figure SPM.10 is given in the TS Supplementary Material. 	0
The commitment to past emissions is a persistent warming for hundreds of years, continuing at about the level of warming that has been realized when emissions were ceased. The persistence of this CO2-induced warming after emission have ceased results from a compensation between the delayed commitment warming described above and the slow reduction in atmospheric CO2 resulting from ocean and land carbon uptake. This persistence of warming also results from the nonlinear dependence of RF on atmospheric CO2, that is, the relative decrease in forcing being smaller than the relative decrease in CO2 concentration. For high climate sensitivities, and in particular if sulphate aerosol emissions are eliminated at the same time as GHG emissions, the commitment from past emission can be strongly positive, and is a superposition of a fast response to reduced aerosols emissions and a slow response to reduced CO2. 	0
TS.5.8.1 Monsoon Systems Global measures of monsoon by the area and summer precipitation are likely to increase in the 21st century, while the monsoon circulation weakens. Monsoon onset dates are likely to become earlier or not to change much while monsoon withdrawal dates are likely to delay, resulting in a lengthening of the monsoon season in many regions . The increase in seasonal mean precipitation is pronounced in the East and South Asian summer monsoons while the change in other monsoon regions is subject to larger uncertainties. There is medium confidence that overall precipitation associated with the Asian-Australian monsoon will increase but with a north-south asymmetry: Indian monsoon rainfall is projected to increase, while projected changes in the Australian summer monsoon rainfall are	0
TS.5.8.2 Tropical Phenomena Precipitation change varies in space, increasing in some regions and decreasing in some others. The spatial distribution of tropical rainfall changes is likely shaped by the current climatology and ocean warming pattern. The first effect is to increase rainfall near the currently rainy regions, and the second effect increases rainfall where the ocean warming exceeds the tropical mean. There is medium confidence that tropical rainfall projections are more reliable for the seasonal than annual mean changes. There is medium confidence in future increase in seasonal mean precipitation on the equatorial flank of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and a decrease in precipitation in the subtropics including parts 105	0
TS.5.8.3 El Nino-Southern Oscillation There is high confidence that the El Nino-Southern Oscillation  will remain the dominant mode of natural climate variability in the 21st century with global influences in the 21st century, and that regional rainfall variability it induces likely intensifies. Natural variations of the amplitude and spatial pattern of ENSO are so large that confidence in any projected change for the 21st century remains low. The projected change in El Nino amplitude is small for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 compared to the spread of the change among models . Over the North Pacific and North America, patterns of temperature and precipitation anomalies related to El Nino and La Nina  are likely to move eastwards in the future , while confidence is low in changes in climate impacts on other regions including Central and South Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, most of Asia, Australia and most Pacific Islands. In a warmer climate, the increase in atmospheric moisture intensifies temporal variability	0

Projections for the 21st century indicate that it is likely that the global frequency of tropical cyclones will either decrease or remain essentially unchanged, concurrent with a likely increase in both global mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed and rain rates . The influence of future climate change on tropical cyclones is likely to vary by region, but there is low confidence in region-specific projections. The frequency of the most intense storms will more likely than not increase in some basins. More extreme precipitation near the centers of tropical cyclones making landfall is projected in North and Central America, East Africa, West, East, South and Southeast Asia as well as in Australia and many Pacific islands . 	0
The global number of extratropical cyclones is unlikely to decrease by more than a few percent and future changes in storms are likely to be small compared to natural interannual variability and substantial variations between models. A small poleward shift is likely in the SH storm track but the magnitude of this change is model dependent. It is unlikely that the response of the North Atlantic storm track in climate projections is a simple poleward shift. There is medium confidence in a projected poleward shift in the North Pacific storm track. There is low confidence in the impact of storm track changes on regional climate at the surface. More precipitation in extratropical cyclones leads to a winter precipitation increase in Arctic, Northern Europe, North America and the mid-to-high-latitude SH. 	0

All values represent expected percent change in the average over period 2081-2100 relative to 2000-2019, under an A1B-like scenario, based on expert judgement after subjective normalization of the model projections. Four metrics were considered: the percent change in I) the total annual frequency of tropical storms, II) the annual frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms, III) the mean Lifetime Maximum Intensity  and IV) the precipitation rate within 200 km of storm center at the time of LMI. For each metric plotted, the solid blue line is the best guess of the expected percent change, and the coloured bar provides the 67%  confidence interval for this value . Where a metric is not plotted, there are insufficient data  available to complete an assessment. A randomly drawn  selection of historical storm tracks are underlaid to identify regions of tropical cyclone activity. See Section 14.6.1 for details. 	0
TFE.9 | Climate Extremes Assessing changes in climate extremes poses unique challenges, not just because of the intrinsically rare nature of these events, but because they invariably happen in conjunction with disruptive conditions. They are strongly influenced by both small- and large-scale weather patterns, modes of variability, thermodynamic processes, land- atmosphere feedbacks and antecedent conditions. Much progress has been made since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report  including the comprehensive assessment of extremes undertaken by the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risk of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation  but also because of the amount of observational evidence available, improvements in our understanding and the ability of models to simulate extremes. 	0
TFE.9, Table 1 indicates the changes that have been observed in a range of weather and climate extremes over the last 50 years, the assessment of the human contribution to those changes, and how those extremes are expected to change in the future. The table also compares the current assessment with that of the AR4 and the SREX where applicable. Since AR4, the understanding of mechanisms and feedbacks leading to changes in extremes has improved. There continues to be strengthening evidence for a human influence on the observed frequency of extreme temperatures and heat waves in some regions. Near-term  projections suggest likely increases in temperature extremes but with little distinguishable separation between emissions scenarios . Changes may proceed at 	0
* The direct comparison of assessment findings between reports is difficult. For some climate variables, different aspects have been assessed, and the revised guidance note on uncertainties has been used for the SREX and AR5. The availability of new information, improved scientific understanding, continued analyses of data and models, and specific differences in methodologies applied in the assessed studies, all contribute to revised assessment findings. Notes: a Attribution is based on available case studies. It is likely that human influence has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of some observed heat waves in some locations. b Models project near-term increases in the duration, intensity and spatial extent of heat waves and warm spells. c In most continents, confidence in trends is not higher than medium except in North America and Europe where there have been likely increases in either the frequency or intensity of heavy precipitation with some seasonal and/or regional variation. It is very likely that there have been increases in central North America. d The frequency and intensity of drought has likely increased in the Mediterranean and West Africa and likely decreased in central North America and north-west Australia. e AR4 assessed the area affected by drought. f SREX assessed medium confidence that anthropogenic influence had contributed to some changes in the drought patterns observed in the second half of the 20th century, based on its attributed impact on precipitation and temperature changes. SREX assessed low confidence in the attribution of changes in droughts at the level of single regions. g There is low confidence in projected changes in soil moisture. h Regional to global-scale projected decreases in soil moisture and increased agricultural drought are likely  in presently dry regions by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Soil moisture drying in the Mediterranean, Southwest USA and southern African regions is consistent with projected changes in Hadley circulation and increased surface temperatures, so there is high confidence in likely surface drying in these regions by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. i There is medium confidence that a reduction in aerosol forcing over the North Atlantic has contributed at least in part to the observed increase in tropical cyclone activity since the 1970s in this region. j Based on expert judgment and assessment of projections which use an SRES A1B  scenario. k Attribution is based on the close relationship between observed changes in extreme and mean sea level. l There is high confidence that this increase in extreme high sea level will primarily be the result of an increase in mean sea level. There is low confidence in region-specific projections of storminess and associated storm surges. m SREX assessed it to be very likely that mean sea level rise will contribute to future upward trends in extreme coastal high water levels.	0

Tropical and Extratropical Cyclones There is low confidence in long-term  changes in tropical cyclone activity, after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities. However over the satellite era, increases in the frequency and intensity of the strongest storms in the North Atlantic are robust . However, the cause of this increase is debated and there is low confidence in attribution of changes in tropical cyclone activity to human influence owing to insufficient observational evidence, lack of physical understanding of the links between anthropogenic drivers of climate and tropical cyclone activity and the low level of agreement between studies as to the relative importance of internal variability, and anthropogenic and natural forcings. 	0
Executive Summary Human Effects on Climate Human activities are continuing to affect the Earth's energy budget by changing the emissions and resulting atmospheric concentrations of radiatively important gases and aerosols and by changing land surface properties. Previous assessments have already shown through multiple lines of evidence that the climate is changing across our planet, largely as a result of human activities. The most compelling evidence of climate change derives from observations of the atmosphere, land, oceans and cryosphere. Unequivocal evidence from in situ observations and ice core records shows that the atmospheric concentrations of important greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrous oxide  have increased over the last few centuries. 	0
Multiple Lines of Evidence for Climate Change Global mean surface air temperatures over land and oceans have increased over the last 100 years. Temperature measurements in the oceans show a continuing increase in the heat content of the oceans. Analyses based on measurements of the Earth's radiative budget suggest a small positive energy imbalance that serves to increase the global heat content of the Earth system. Observations from satellites and in situ measurements show a trend of significant reductions in the mass balance of most land ice masses and in Arctic sea ice. The oceans' uptake of CO2 is having a significant effect on the chemistry of sea water. Paleoclimatic reconstructions have helped place ongoing climate change in the perspective of natural climate variability. 	0
Observations of CO2 concentrations, globally averaged temperature and sea level rise are generally well within the range of the extent of the earlier IPCC projections. The recently observed increases in CH4 and N2O concentrations are smaller than those assumed in the scenarios in the previous assessments. Each IPCC assessment has used new projections of future climate change that have become more detailed as the models have become more advanced. Similarly, the scenarios used in the IPCC assessments have themselves changed over time to reflect the state of knowledge. The range of climate projections from model results provided and assessed in the first IPCC assessment in 1990 to those in the 2007 AR4 provides an opportunity to compare the projections with the actually observed changes, thereby examining the deviations of the projections from the observations over time. 	0
Advances in Measurement and Modelling Capabilities Over the last few decades, new observational systems, especially satellite-based systems, have increased the number of observations of the Earth's climate by orders of magnitude. Tools to analyse and process these data have been developed or enhanced to cope with this large increase in information, and more climate proxy data have been acquired to improve our knowledge of past changes in climate. Because the Earth's climate system is characterized on multiple spatial and temporal scales, new observations may reduce the uncertainties surrounding the understanding of short timescale	0
Increases in computing speed and memory have led to the development of more sophisticated models that describe physical, chemical and biological processes in greater detail. Modelling strategies have been extended to provide better estimates of the uncertainty in climate change projections. The model comparisons with observations have pushed the analysis and development of the models. The inclusion of `long-term' simulations has allowed incorporation of information from paleoclimate data to inform projections. Within uncertainties associated with reconstructions of past climate variables from proxy record and forcings, paleoclimate information from the Mid Holocene, Last Glacial Maximum, and Last Millennium have been used to test the ability of models to simulate realistically the magnitude and large-scale patterns of past changes. 	0
This introductory chapter serves as a lead-in to the science presented in the Working Group I  contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  Fifth Assessment Report . Chapter 1 in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report   provided a historical perspective on the understanding of climate science and the evidence regarding human influence on the Earth's climate system. Since the last assessment, the scientific knowledge gained through observations, theoretical analyses, and modelling studies has continued to increase and to strengthen further the evidence linking human activities to the ongoing climate change. In AR5, Chapter 1 focuses on the concepts and definitions applied in the discussions of new findings in the other chapters. It also examines several of the key indicators for a changing climate and shows how the current knowledge of those indicators compares with the projections made in previous assessments. The new scenarios for projected human-related emissions used in this assessment are also introduced. Finally, the chapter discusses the directions and capabilities of current climate science, while the detailed discussion of new findings is covered in the remainder of the WGI contribution to the AR5.	0
The IPCC was set up in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme to provide governments with a clear view of the current state of knowledge about the science of climate change, potential impacts, and options for adaptation and mitigation through regular assessments of the most recent information published in the scientific, technical and socio-economic literature worldwide. The WGI contribution to the IPCC AR5 assesses the current state of the physical sciences with respect to climate change. This report presents an assessment of the current state of research results and is not a discussion of all relevant papers as would be included in a review. It thus seeks to make sure that the range of scientific views, as represented in the peer-reviewed literature, is considered and evaluated in the assessment, and that the state of the science is concisely and accurately presented. A transparent review process ensures that disparate views are included . As an overview, Table 1.1 shows a selection of key findings from earlier IPCC assessments. This table provides a non-comprehensive selection of key assessment statements from previous assessment reports-- IPCC First Assessment Report , IPCC Second Assessment Report , IPCC Third Assessment Report  and IPCC Fourth Assessment Report -- with a focus on policy-relevant quantities that have been evaluated in each of the IPCC assessments. Scientific hypotheses are contingent and always open to revision in light of new evidence and theory. In this sense the distinguishing features of scientific enquiry are the search for truth and the willingness to subject itself to critical re-examination. Modern research science	0
conducts this critical revision through processes such as the peer review. At conferences and in the procedures that surround publication in peer-reviewed journals, scientific claims about environmental processes are analysed and held up to scrutiny. Even after publication, findings are further analysed and evaluated. That is the self-correcting nature of the scientific process . Science strives for objectivity but inevitably also involves choices and judgements. Scientists make choices regarding data and models, which processes to include and which to leave out. Usually these choices are uncontroversial and play only a minor role in the production of research. Sometimes, however, the choices scientists make are sources of disagreement and uncertainty. These are usually resolved by further scientific enquiry into the sources of disagreement. In some cases, experts cannot reach a consensus view. Examples in climate science include how best to evaluate climate models relative to observations, how best to evaluate potential sea level rise and how to evaluate probabilistic projections of climate change. In many cases there may be no definitive solution to these questions. The IPCC process is aimed at assessing the literature as it stands and attempts to reflect the level of reasonable scientific consensus as well as disagreement. To assess areas of scientific controversy, the peer-reviewed literature is considered and evaluated. Not all papers on a controversial point can be discussed individually in an assessment, but every effort has been made here to ensure that all views represented in the peer-reviewed literature are considered in the assessment process. A list of topical issues is given in Table 1.3. The Earth sciences study the multitude of processes that shape our environment. Some of these processes can be understood through idealized laboratory experiments, by altering a single element and then tracing through the effects of that controlled change. However, as in other natural and the social sciences, the openness of environmental systems, in terms of our lack of control of the boundaries of the system, their spatially and temporally multi-scale character and the complexity of interactions, often hamper scientists' ability to definitively isolate causal links. This in turn places important limits on the understanding of many of the inferences in the Earth sciences . There are many cases where scientists are able to make inferences using statistical tools with considerable evidential support and with high degrees of confidence, and conceptual and numerical modelling can assist in forming understanding and intuition about the interaction of dynamic processes.	0
Climate varies naturally on all timescales from hundreds of millions of years down to the year-to-year. Prominent in the Earth's history have been the 100,000 year glacial-interglacial cycles when climate was mostly cooler than at present. Global surface temperatures have typically varied by 5C to 7C through these cycles, with large changes in ice volume and sea level, and temperature changes as great as 10C to 15C in some middle and high latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Since the end of the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago, global surface temperatures have probably fluctuated by little more than 1C. Some fluctuations have lasted several centuries, including the Little Ice Age which ended in the nineteenth century and which appears to have been global in extent.	0
p resence of clouds, precipitation; and the occurrence of special phenomena, such as thunderstorms, dust storms, tornados and others. Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the average weather, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The relevant quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation and wind. Classically the period for averaging these variables is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization. Climate in a wider sense also includes not just the mean conditions, but also the associated statistics , often combining parameters to describe phenomena such as droughts. Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified  by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer.	0
ture has been relatively constant over many centuries, the incoming solar energy must be nearly in balance with outgoing radiation. Of the incoming solar shortwave radiation , about half is absorbed by the Earth's surface. The fraction of SWR reflected back to space by gases and aerosols, clouds and by the Earth's surface  is approximately 30%, and about 20% is absorbed in the atmosphere. Based on the temperature of the Earth's surface the majority of the outgoing energy flux from the Earth is in the infrared part of the spectrum. The longwave radiation  emitted from the Earth's surface is largely absorbed by certain atmospheric constituents--water vapour, carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide  and other greenhouse gases ; see Annex III for Glossary--and clouds, which themselves emit LWR into all directions. The downward directed component of this LWR adds heat to the lower layers of the atmosphere and to the Earth's surface . The dominant energy loss of the infrared radiation from the Earth is from higher layers of the troposphere. The Sun provides its energy to the Earth primarily in the tropics and the subtropics; this energy is then partially redistributed to middle and high latitudes by atmospheric and oceanic transport processes.	0
Figure 1.1 | Main drivers of climate change. The radiative balance between incoming solar shortwave radiation  and outgoing longwave radiation  is influenced by global climate `drivers'. Natural fluctuations in solar output  can cause changes in the energy balance  . Human activity changes the emissions of gases and aerosols, which are involved in atmospheric chemical reactions, resulting in modified O3 and aerosol amounts . O3 and aerosol particles absorb, scatter and reflect SWR, changing the energy balance. Some aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei modifying the properties of cloud droplets and possibly affecting precipitation . Because cloud interactions with SWR and LWR are large, small changes in the properties of clouds have important implications for the radiative budget . Anthropogenic changes in GHGs  and large aerosols  modify the amount of outgoing LWR by absorbing outgoing LWR and re-emitting less energy at a lower temperature . Surface albedo is changed by changes in vegetation or land surface properties, snow or ice cover and ocean colour . These changes are driven by natural seasonal and diurnal changes , as well as human influence  .	0
Changes in the global energy budget derive from either changes in the net incoming solar radiation or changes in the outgoing longwave radiation . Changes in the net incoming solar radiation derive from changes in the Sun's output of energy or changes in the Earth's albedo. Reliable measurements of total solar irradiance  can be made only from space, and the precise record extends back only to 1978. The generally accepted mean value of the TSI is about 1361 W m-2 ; this is lower than the previous value of 1365 W m-2 used in the earlier assessments. Short-term variations of a few tenths of a percent are common during the approximately 11-year sunspot solar cycle . Changes in the outgoing LWR can result from changes in the temperature of the Earth's surface or atmosphere or changes in the emissivity  of LWR from either the atmosphere or the Earth's surface. For the atmosphere, these changes in emissivity are due predominantly to changes in cloud cover and cloud properties, in GHGs and in aerosol concentrations. The radiative energy budget of the Earth is almost in balance , but ocean heat content and satellite measurements indicate a small positive imbalance  that is consistent with the rapid changes in the atmospheric composition. In addition, some aerosols increase atmospheric reflectivity, whereas others  are strong absorbers and also modify SWR . Indirectly, aerosols also affect cloud albedo, because many aerosols serve as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei. This means that changes in aerosol types and distribution can result in small but important changes in cloud albedo and lifetime . Clouds play a critical role in climate because they not only can increase albedo, thereby cooling the planet, but also because of their warming effects through infrared radiative transfer. Whether the net radiative effect of a cloud is one of cooling or of warming depends on its physical properties  as well as on the nature of the cloud condensation nuclei population . Humans enhance the greenhouse effect directly by emitting GHGs such as CO2, CH4, N2O and chlorofluorocarbons  . In addition, pollutants such as carbon monoxide , volatile organic compounds , nitrogen oxides  and sulphur dioxide , which by themselves are negligible GHGs, have an indirect effect on the greenhouse effect by altering, through atmospheric chemical reactions, the abundance of important gases to the amount of outgoing LWR such as CH4 and ozone , and/or by acting as precursors of secondary aerosols. Because anthropogenic emission sources simultaneously can emit some chemicals that affect climate and others that affect air pollution, including some that affect both, atmospheric chemistry and climate science are intrinsically linked. In addition to changing the atmospheric concentrations of gases and aerosols, humans are affecting both the energy and water budget of the planet by changing the land surface, including redistributing the balance between latent and sensible heat fluxes . Land use changes, such as the conversion of forests to cultivated land, change the characteristics of vegetation, including its colour, seasonal growth and carbon content . For example, clearing and burning a forest to prepare agricultural	0
example, changes in the solar irradiance and changes in atmospheric trace gas and aerosol concentrations . The concept of RF cannot capture the interactions of anthropogenic aerosols and clouds, for example, and thus in addition to the RF as used in previous assessments, Sections 7.4 and 8.1 introduce a new concept, effective radiative forcing , that accounts for rapid response in the climate system. ERF is defined as the change in net downward flux at the top of the atmosphere after allowing for atmospheric temperatures, water vapour, clouds and land albedo to adjust, but with either sea surface temperatures  and sea ice cover unchanged or with global mean surface temperature unchanged. Once a forcing is applied, complex internal feedbacks determine the eventual response of the climate system, and will in general cause this response to differ from a simple linear one . There are many feedback mechanisms in the climate system that can either amplify  or diminish  the effects of a change in climate forcing  . An e xample of a positive feedback is the water vapour feedback whereby an increase in surface temperature enhances the amount of water vapour present in the atmosphere. Water vapour is a powerful GHG: increasing its atmospheric concentration enhances the greenhouse effect and leads to further surface warming. Another example is the ice albedo feedback, in which the albedo decreases as highly reflective ice and snow surfaces melt, exposing the darker and more absorbing surfaces below. The dominant negative feedback is the increased emission of energy through LWR as surface temperature increases . Some feedbacks operate quickly , while others develop over decades to centuries; in order to understand the full impact of a feedback mechanism, its timescale needs to be considered. Melting of land ice sheets can take days to millennia. A spectrum of models is used to project quantitatively the climate response to forcings. The simplest energy balance models use one box to represent the Earth system and solve the global energy balance to deduce globally averaged surface air temperature. At the other extreme, full complexity three-dimensional climate models include the explicit solution of energy, momentum and mass conservation equations at millions of points on the Earth in the atmosphere, land, ocean and cryosphere. More recently, capabilities for the explicit simulation of the biosphere, the carbon cycle and atmospheric chemistry have been added to the full complexity models, and these models are called Earth System Models . Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity include the same processes as ESMs, but at reduced resolution, and thus can be simulated for longer periods . 127	0
An equilibrium climate experiment is an experiment in which a climate model is allowed to adjust fully to a specified change in RF. Such experiments provide information on the difference between the initial and final states of the model simulated climate, but not on the time-dependent response. The equilibrium response in global mean surface air temperature to a doubling of atmospheric concentration of CO2 above pre-industrial levels  has often been used as the basis for the concept of equilibrium climate sensitivity . For more realistic simulations of climate, changes in RF are applied gradually over time, for example, using historical reconstructions of the CO2, and these simulations are called transient simulations. The temperature response in these transient simulations is different than in an equilibrium simulation. The transient climate response is defined as the change in global surface temperature at the time of atmospheric CO2 doubling in a global coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model simulation where concentrations of CO2 were increased by 1% yr-1. The transient climate response	0
is a measure of the strength and rapidity of the surface temperature response to GHG forcing. It can be more meaningful for some problems as well as easier to derive from observations , but such experiments are not intended to replace the more realistic scenario evaluations. Climate change commitment is defined as the future change to which the climate system is committed by virtue of past or current forcings. The components of the climate system respond on a large range of timescales, from the essentially rapid responses that characterise some radiative feedbacks to millennial scale responses such as those associated with the behaviour of the carbon cycle  and ice sheets . Even if anthropogenic emissions were immediately ceased  or if climate forcings were fixed at current values , the climate system would continue to change until it came into equilibrium with those forcings . Because of the slow response time of some components	0
of the climate system, equilibrium conditions will not be reached for many centuries. Slow processes can sometimes be constrained only by data collected over long periods, giving a particular salience to paleoclimate data for understanding equilibrium processes. Climate change commitment is indicative of aspects of inertia in the climate system because it captures the ongoing nature of some aspects of change. A summary of perturbations to the forcing of the climate system from changes in solar radiation, GHGs, surface albedo and aerosols is presented in Box 13.1. The energy fluxes from these perturbations are balanced by increased radiation to space from a warming Earth, reflection of solar radiation and storage of energy in the Earth system, principally the oceans . The processes affecting climate can exhibit considerable natural variability. Even in the absence of external forcing, periodic and chaotic variations on a vast range of spatial and temporal scales are observed. Much of this variability can be represented by simple  distributions, but many components of the climate system also exhibit multiple states--for instance, the glacial-interglacial cycles and certain modes of internal variability such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation  . Movement between states can occur as a result of natural variability, or in response to external forcing. The relationship between variability, forcing and response reveals the complexity of the dynamics of the climate system: the relationship between forcing and response for some parts of the system seems reasonably linear; in other cases this relationship is much more complex, characterised by hysteresis  and a non-additive combination of feedbacks. Related to multiple climate states, and hysteresis, is the concept of irreversibility in the climate system. In some cases where multiple states and irreversibility combine, bifurcations or `tipping points' can been reached . In these situations, it is difficult if not impossible for the climate system to revert to its previous state, and the change is termed irreversible over some timescale and forcing range. A small number of studies using simplified models find evidence for global-scale `tipping points' ; however, there is no evidence for global-scale tipping points in any of the most comprehensive models evaluated to date in studies of climate evolution in the 21st century. There is evidence for threshold behaviour in certain aspects of the climate system, such as ocean circulation  and ice sheets , on multi-centennial-to-millennial timescales. There are also arguments for the existence of regional tipping points, most notably in the Arctic , although aspects of this are contested .	0
ble evidence from in situ observations and ice core records that the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs such as CO2, CH4, and N2O have increased substantially over the last 200 years . In addition, instrumental observations show that land and sea surface temperatures have increased over the last 100 years . Satellites allow a much broader spatial distribution of measurements, especially over the last 30 years. For the upper ocean temperature the observations indicate that the temperature has increased since at least 1950 . Observations from satellites and in situ measurements suggest reductions in glaciers, Arctic sea ice and ice sheets . In addition, analyses based on measurements of the radiative budget and ocean heat content suggest a small imbalance . These observations, all published in peer-reviewed journals, made by diverse measurement groups in multiple countries using different technologies, investigating various climate-relevant types of data, uncertainties and processes, offer a wide range of evidence on the broad extent of the changing climate throughout our planet. Conceptual and numerical models of the Earth's climate system offer another line of evidence on climate change . These use our basic understanding of the climate system to provide self-consistent methodologies for calculating impacts of processes and changes. Numerical models include the current knowledge about the laws of physics, chemistry and biology, as well as hypotheses about how complicated processes such as cloud formation can occur. Because these models can represent only the existing state of knowledge and technology, they are not perfect; they are, however, important tools for analysing uncertainties or unknowns, for testing different hypotheses for causation relative to observations, and for making projections of possible future changes. One of the most powerful methods for assessing changes occurring in climate involves the use of statistical tools to test the analyses from models relative to observations. This methodology is generally called detection and attribution in the climate change community . For example, climate models indicate that the temperature response to GHG increases is expected to be different than the effects from aerosols or from solar variability. Radiosonde measurements and satellite retrievals of atmospheric temperature show increases in tropospheric temperature and decreases in stratospheric temperatures, consistent with the increases in GHG effects found in climate model simulations , but if the Sun was the main driver of current climate change, stratospheric and tropospheric temperatures would respond with the same sign . Resources available prior to the instrumental period--historical sources, natural archives, and proxies for key climate variables --can provide quantitative information on past regional to global climate and atmospheric composition variability and these data contribute another line of evidence. Reconstructions of key climate variables based on these data sets have provided important information on the responses of the Earth system to a variety of external forcings and its internal variability over a wide range of timescales (Hansen et al., 2006; Mann et al., 129	0
important climate parameters are discussed in this section and all are assessed in much more detail in other chapters. As was done to a more limited extent in AR4 , this section provides a test of the planetary-scale hypotheses of climate change against observations. In other words, how well do the projections used in the past assessments compare with observations to date? Seven additional years of observations are now available to evaluate earlier model projections. The projected range that was given in each assessment is compared to observations. The largest possible range of scenarios available for a specific variable for each of the previous assessment reports is shown in the figures. Based on the assessment of AR4, a number of the key climate and associated environmental parameters are presented in Figure 1.3, which updates the similar figure in the Technical Summary  of IPCC . This section discusses the recent changes in several indicators, while more thorough assessments for each of these indicators are	0
p rovided in other chapters. Also shown in parentheses in Figure 1.3 are the chapter and section where those indicators of change are assessed in AR5. Note that projections presented in the IPCC assessments are not predictions ; the analyses in the discussion below only examine the short-term plausibility of the projections up to AR4, including the scenarios for future emissions and the models used to simulate these scenarios in the earlier assessments. Model results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5   used in AR5 are therefore not included in this section; Chapters 11 and 12 describe the projections from the new modelling studies. Note that none of the scenarios examined in the IPCC assessments were ever intended to be short-term predictors of change.	0
models generally simulate global temperatures that compare well with observations over climate timescales . Even though the projections from the models were never intended to be predictions over such a short timescale, the observations through 2012 generally fall within the projections made in all past assessments. The 1990- 2012 data have been shown to be consistent with the FAR projections , and not consistent with zero trend from 1990, even in the presence of substantial natural variability . The scenarios were designed to span a broad range of plausible futures, but are not aimed at predicting the most likely outcome. The scenarios considered for the projections from the earlier reports  had a much simpler basis than those of the Special Report on Emission Scenarios   used in the later assessments. For example, the FAR scenarios did not specify future aerosol distributions. AR4 presented a multiple set of projections that were simulated using comprehensive ocean-atmosphere models provided by CMIP3 and these projections are continuations of transient simulations of the 20th century climate. These projections of temperature provide in addition a measure of the natural variability that could not be obtained	0

Values are harmonized to start from the same value in 1990. Observed global annual mean surface air temperature anomaly, relative to 1961-1990, is shown as squares and smoothed time series as solid lines , NOAA , and the UK Hadley Centre  reanalyses). The coloured shading shows the projected range of global annual mean surface air temperature change from 1990 to 2035 for models used in FAR , SAR , TAR  in Cubasch et al., 2001). TAR results are based on the simple climate model analyses presented and not on the individual full three-dimensional climate model simulations. For the AR4 results are presented as single model runs of the CMIP3 ensemble for the historical period from 1950 to 2000  and for three scenarios  from 2001 to 2035. The bars at the right-hand side of the graph show the full range given for 2035 for each assessment report. For the three SRES scenarios the bars show the CMIP3 ensemble mean and the likely range given by -40% to +60% of the mean as assessed in Meehl et al. . The publication years of the assessment reports are shown. See Appendix 1.A for details on the data and calculations used to create this figure.	0
Note that before TAR the climate models did not include natural forcing . Even in AR4 not all models included natural forcing and some also did not include aerosols. Those models that allowed for aerosol effects presented in the AR4 simulated, for example, the cooling effects of the 1991 Mt Pinatubo eruption and agree better with the observed temperatures than the previous assessments that did not include those effects. The bars on the side for FAR, SAR and TAR represent the range of results for the scenarios at the end of the time period and are not error bars. In contrast to the previous reports, the AR4 gave an assessment of the individual scenarios with a mean estimate  and a likely range  . In summary, the trend in globally averaged surface temperatures falls within the range of the previous IPCC projections. During the last decade the trend in the observations is smaller than the mean of the projections of AR4 . As shown by Hawkins and Sutton , trends in the observations during short-timescale periods  can be dominated by natural variability in the Earth's climate system. Similar episodes are also seen in climate model experiments . Due to	0
Key indicators of global climate change also include the changing concentrations of the radiatively important GHGs that are significant drivers for this change . Figures 1.5 through 1.7 show the recent globally and annually averaged observed concentrations for the gases of most concern, CO2, CH4, and N2O . As discussed in the later chapters, accurate measurements of these long-lived gases come from a number of monitoring stations throughout the world. The observations in these figures are compared with the projections from the previous IPCC assessments. The model simulations begin with historical emissions up to 1990. The further evolution of these gases was described by scenario projections. TAR and AR4 model concentrations after 1990 are based on the SRES	0

Climate change, whether driven by natural or human forcings, can lead to changes in the likelihood of the occurrence or strength of extreme weather and climate events such as extreme precipitation events or warm spells ; Seneviratne et al., 2012). An extreme weather event is one that is rare at a particular place and/or time of year. Definitions of `rare' vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from observations . By definition, the characteristics of what is called extreme weather may vary from place to place in an absolute sense. At present, single extreme events cannot generally be directly attributed to anthropogenic influence, although the change in likelihood for the event to occur has been determined for some events by accounting for observed changes in climate . When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some time, such as a season, it may be classified as an extreme climate event, especially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme . For some climate extremes such as drought, floods and heat waves, several factors such as duration and intensity need to be combined to produce an extreme event . The probability of occurrence of values of a climate or weather variable can be described by a probability density function  that for some variables  is shaped similar to a Gaussian curve. A PDF is a function that indicates the relative chances of occurrence of different outcomes of a variable. Simple statistical reasoning indicates that substantial changes in the frequency of extreme events  can result from a relatively small shift in the distribution of a weather or climate variable. Figure 1.8a shows a schematic of such a PDF and illustrates the effect of a small shift in the mean of a variable on the frequency of extremes at either end of the distribution. An increase in the frequency of one extreme  can be accompanied by 134	0
Figure 1.8 | Schematic representations of the probability density function of daily temperature, which tends to be approximately Gaussian, and daily precipitation, which has a skewed distribution. Dashed lines represent a previous distribution and solid lines a changed distribution. The probability of occurrence, or frequency, of extremes is denoted by the shaded areas. In the case of temperature, changes in the frequencies of extremes are affected by changes  in the mean,  in the variance or shape, and  in both the mean and the variance.  In a skewed distribution such as that of precipitation, a change in the mean of the distribution generally affects its variability or spread, and thus an increase in mean precipitation would also imply an increase in heavy precipitation extremes, and vice-versa. In addition, the shape of the right-hand tail could also change, affecting extremes. Furthermore, climate change may alter the frequency of precipitation and the duration of dry spells between precipitation events. 	0
a decline in the opposite extreme . Changes in the variability, skewness or the shape of the distribution can complicate this simple picture . While the SAR found that data and analyses of extremes related to climate change were sparse, improved monitoring and data for changes in extremes were available for the TAR, and climate models were being analysed to provide projections of extremes. In AR4, the observational basis of analyses of extremes had increased substantially, so that some extremes were now examined over most land areas . More models with higher resolution, and a larger number	0
More intense precipitation events  Heavy precipitation events. Frequency  increases  Statistically significant trends in the number of heavy precipitation events in some regions. It is likely that more of these regions have experienced increases than decreases. 4 See SREX Table 3-3 for details on precipitation extremes for the different regions. 5 Increased summer continental drying and associated risk of drought 6 Area affected by droughts increases 7 Some areas include southern Europe and the Mediterranean region, central Europe, central North America and Mexico, northeast Brazil and southern Africa 8 Increase in tropical cyclone peak wind intensities 9 Increase in intense tropical cyclone activity 10 In any observed long-term  after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities  11 Increase in average tropical cyclone maximum wind speed is, although not in all ocean basins; either decrease or no change in the global frequency of tropical cyclones 12 Increase in extreme coastal high water worldwide related to increases in mean sea level in the late 20th century 13 Mean sea level rise will contribute to upward trends in extreme coastal high water levels 1	0
the `higher maximum temperature' the likelihood level was raised from likely in the TAR to very likely in SREX. While the diurnal temperature range was assessed in the Extremes-Table of the TAR, it was no longer included in the Extremes-Table of AR4, since it is not considered a climate extreme in a narrow sense. Diurnal temperature range was, however, reported to decrease for 21st century projections in AR4 . In projections for precipitation extremes, the spatial relevance has been improved from very likely `over many Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes to high latitudes land areas' from the TAR to very likely for all regions in AR4 . However, likelihood in trends in projected precipitation extremes was downscaled to likely in the SREX as a result of a perception of biases and a fairly large spread in the precipitation projections in some regions. SREX also had less confidence than TAR and AR4 in the trends for droughts and dryness, `due to lack of direct observations, some geographical inconsistencies in the trends, and some dependencies of inferred trends on the index choice' . For some extremes  the definition changed between the TAR and the AR4. Whereas the TAR only made a statement about the peak wind speed of tropical cyclones, the AR4 also stressed the overall increase in intense tropical cyclone activity. The `low confidence' for any long term trend  in the observed changes of the tropical cyclone activities is due to uncertainties in past observational capabilities . The `increase in extreme sea level' has been added in the AR4. Such an increase is likely according to the AR4 and the SREX for observed trends, and very likely for the climate projections reported in the SREX. The assessed likelihood of anthropogenic contributions to trends is lower for variables where the assessment is based on indirect evidence. Especially for extremes that are the result of a combination of factors such as droughts, linking a particular extreme event to specific causal relationships is difficult to determine  . In some cases , however, it may be possible to estimate the human-related contribution to such changes in the probability of occurrence of extremes .	0
non-uniform density change, circulation changes, and deformation of ocean basins, the evidence indicates that the global mean sea level is rising, and that this is likely  resulting from global climate change . The historical tide gauge record shows that the average rate of global mean sea level rise over the 20th century was 1.7  0.2 mm yr-1 . This rate increased to 3.2  0.4 mm yr-1 since 1990, mostly because of increased t hermal expansion and land ice contributions . Although the long-term sea level record shows decadal and multi-decadal oscillations, there is evidence that the rate of global mean sea level rise during the 20th century was greater than during the 19th century. All of the previous IPCC assessments have projected that global sea level will continue to rise throughout this century for the scenarios examined. Figure 1.10 compares the observed sea level rise since 1950 with the projections from the prior IPCC assessments. Earlier models had greater uncertainties in modelling the contributions, because of limited observational evidence and deficiencies in theoretical understanding of relevant processes. Also, projections for sea level change in the prior assessments are scenarios for the response to anthropogenic forcing only; they do not include unforced or natural interannual variability. Nonetheless, the results show that the actual change is in the middle of projected changes from the prior assessments, and towards the higher end of the studies from TAR and AR4.	0
1.3.4.2 Ocean Acidification The observed decrease in ocean pH resulting from increasing concentrations of CO2 is another indicator of global change. As discussed in AR4, the ocean's uptake of CO2 is having a significant impact on the chemistry of sea water. The average pH of ocean surface waters has fallen by about 0.1 units, from about 8.2 to 8.1  since 1765 . Long time series from several ocean sites show ongoing declines in pH, consistent with results from repeated pH measurements on ship transects spanning much of the globe . Ocean time-series in the North Atlantic and North Pacific record a decrease in pH ranging between -0.0015 and -0.0024 per year . Due to the increased storage of carbon by the ocean, ocean acidification will increase in the future . In addition to other impacts of global climate change, ocean acidification poses potentially serious threats to the health of the world's oceans ecosystems .	1
1.3.4.3 Ice Rapid sea ice loss is one of the most prominent indicators of Arctic climate change . There has been a trend of decreasing Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent since 1978, with the summer of 2012 being the lowest in recorded history . The 2012 minimum sea ice extent was 49% below the 1979 to 2000 average and 18% below the previous record from 2007. The amount of multi-year sea ice has been reduced, i.e., the sea ice has been thinning and thus the ice volume is reduced . These changes make the sea ice less resistant to wind forcing.	0
Figure 1.10 | Estimated changes in the observed global annual mean sea level  since 1950 relative to 1961-1990. Estimated changes in global annual sea level anomalies are presented based on tide gauge data  and based on sea surface altimetry . The altimetry data start in 1993 and are harmonized to start from the mean 1993 value of the tide gauge data. Squares indicate annual mean values and solid lines smoothed values. The shading shows the largest model projected range of global annual sea level rise from 1950 to 2035 for FAR , SAR , TAR  and for Church et al.  based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3  model results not assessed at the time of AR4 using the SRES B1, A1B and A2 scenarios. Note that in the AR4 no full range was given for the sea level projections for this period. Therefore, the figure shows results that have been published subsequent to the AR4. The bars at the right-hand side of the graph show the full range given for 2035 for each assessment report. For Church et al.  the mean sea level rise is indicated in addition to the full range. See Appendix 1.A for details on the data and calculations used to create this figure.	0
Sea ice extent has been diminishing significantly faster than projected by most of the AR4 climate models . While AR4 found no consistent trends in Antarctica sea ice, more recent studies indicate a small increase . Various studies since AR4 suggest that this has resulted in a deepening of the low-pressure systems in West Antarctica that in turn caused stronger winds and enhanced ice production in the Ross Sea . AR4 concluded that taken together, the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have very likely been contributing to sea level rise. The Greenland Ice Sheet has lost mass since the early 1990s and the rate of loss has increased . The interior, high-altitude areas are thickening due to increased snow accumulation, but this is more than counterbalanced by the ice loss due to melt and ice discharge . Since 1979, the area experiencing surface melting has increased significantly , with 2010 breaking the record for surface melt area, runoff, and mass loss, and the unprecedented areal extent of surface melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet in 2012 . Overall, the Antarctic continent now experiences a net loss of ice . Significant mass loss has been occurring in the Amundsen Sea sector	0
of West Antarctica and the northern Antarctic Peninsula. The ice sheet on the rest of the continent is relatively stable or thickening slightly . Since AR4, there have been improvements in techniques of measurement, such as gravity, altimetry and mass balance, and understanding of the change . As discussed in the earlier assessments, most glaciers around the globe have been shrinking since the end of the Little Ice Age, with increasing rates of ice loss since the early 1980s . The vertical profiles of temperature measured through the entire thickness of mountain glaciers, or through ice sheets, provide clear evidence of a warming climate over recent decades . As noted in AR4, the greatest mass losses per unit area in the last four decades have been observed in Patagonia, Alaska, northwest USA, southwest Canada, the European Alps, and the Arctic. Alaska and the Arctic are especially important regions as contributors to sea level rise .	0
Science always involves uncertainties. These arise at each step of the scientific method: in the development of models or hypotheses, in measurements and in analyses and interpretation of scientific assumptions. Climate science is not different in this regard from other areas of science. The complexity of the climate system and the large range of processes involved bring particular challenges because, for example, gaps in direct measurements of the past can be filled only by reconstructions using proxy data. Because the Earth's climate system is characterized by multiple spatial and temporal scales, uncertainties do not usually reduce at a single, predictable rate: for example, new observations may reduce the uncertainties surrounding short-timescale processes quite rapidly, while longer timescale processes may require very long observational baselines before much progress can be made. Characterization of the interaction between processes, as quantified by models, can be improved by model development, or can shed light on new areas in which uncertainty is greater than previously thought. The fact that there is only a single realization of the climate, rather than a range of different climates from which to draw, can matter significantly for certain lines of enquiry, most notably for the detection and attribution of causes of climate change and for the evaluation of projections of future states.	0
`Uncertainty' is a complex and multifaceted property, sometimes originating in a lack of information, and at other times from quite fundamental disagreements about what is known or even knowable . Furthermore, scientists often disagree about the best or most appropriate way to characterize these uncertainties: some can be quantified easily while others cannot. Moreover, appropriate characterization is dependent on the intended use of the information and the particular needs of that user community. Scientific uncertainty can be partitioned in various ways, in which the details of the partitioning usually depend on the context. For instance, the process and classifications used for evaluating observational uncertainty in climate science is not the same as that employed to evaluate projections of future change. Uncertainty in measured quantities can arise from a range of sources, such as statistical variation, variability, inherent randomness, inhomogeneity, approximation, subjective judgement, and linguistic imprecision , or from calibration methodologies, instrumental bias or instrumental limitations . In the modelling studies that underpin projections of future climate change, it is common to partition uncertainty into four main categories: scenario uncertainty, due to uncertainty of future emissions of GHGs and other forcing agents; `model uncertainty' associated with climate models; internal variability and initial condition uncertainty; and forcing and boundary condition uncertainty for the assessment of historical and paleoclimate simulations . 138	0
Model uncertainty is an important contributor to uncertainty in climate predictions and projections. It includes, but is not restricted to, the uncertainties introduced by errors in the model's representation of dynamical and physical and bio-geochemical aspects of the climate system as well as in the model's response to external forcing. The phrase `model uncertainty' is a common term in the climate change literature, but different studies use the phrase in different senses: some use it to represent the range of behaviours observed in ensembles of climate model , while others use it in more comprehensive senses . Model spread is often used as a measure of climate response uncertainty, but such a measure is crude as it takes no account of factors such as model quality  or model independence , and not all variables of interest are adequately simulated by global climate models. To maintain a degree of terminological clarity this report distinguishes between `model spread' for this narrower representation of climate model responses and `model uncertainty' which describes uncertainty about the extent to which any particular climate model provides an accurate representation of the real climate system. This uncertainty arises from approximations required in the development of models. Such approximations affect the representation of all aspects of the climate including the response to external forcings. Model uncertainty is sometimes decomposed further into parametric and structural uncertainty, comprising, respectively, uncertainty in the values of model parameters and uncertainty in the underlying model structure . Some scientific research areas, such as detection and attribution and observationally-constrained model projections of future climate, incorporate significant elements of both observational and model-based science, and in these instances both sets of relevant uncertainties need to be incorporated. Scenario uncertainty refers to the uncertainties that arise due to limitations in our understanding of future emissions, concentration or forcing trajectories. Scenarios help in the assessment of future developments in complex systems that are either inherently unpredictable, or that have high scientific uncertainties . The societal choices defining future climate drivers are surrounded by considerable uncertainty, and these are explored by examining the climate response to a wide range of possible futures. In past reports, emissions scenarios from the SRES  were used as the main way of exploring uncertainty in future anthropogenic climate drivers. Recent research has made use of Representative Concentration Pathways  . Internal or natural variability, the natural fluctuations in climate, occur in the absence of any RF of the Earth's climate . Climate varies naturally on nearly all time and space scales, and quantifying precisely the nature of this variability is challenging, and is characterized by considerable uncertainty. The analysis of internal and forced contributions to recent climate is discussed in Chapter 10. The fractional contribution of internal variability compared with other forms of uncertainty varies in time and in space, but usually diminishes with time as other sources of uncertainty become more significant .	0
In the WGI contribution to the AR5, uncertainty is quantified using 90% uncertainty intervals unless otherwise stated. The 90% uncertainty interval, reported in square brackets, is expected to have a 90% likelihood of covering the value that is being estimated. The value that is being estimated has a 5% likelihood of exceeding the upper endpoint of the uncertainty interval, and the value has a 5% likelihood of being less than that the lower endpoint of the uncertainty interval. A best estimate of that value is also given where available. Uncertainty intervals are not necessarily symmetric about the corresponding best estimate. In a subject as complex and diverse as climate change, the information available as well as the way it is expressed, and often the interpretation of that material, varies considerably with the scientific context. In some cases, two studies examining similar material may take different approaches even to the quantification of uncertainty. The interpretation of similar numerical ranges for similar variables can differ from study to study. Readers are advised to pay close attention to the caveats and conditions that surround the results presented in peer-reviewed studies, as well as those presented in this assessment. To help readers in this complex and subtle task, the IPCC draws on specific, calibrated language scales to express uncertainty , as well as specific procedures for the expression of uncertainty . The aim of these structures is to provide tools through which chapter teams might consistently express uncertainty in key results.	0
In the course of the IPCC assessment procedure, chapter teams review the published research literature, document the findings , assess the scientific merit of this information, identify the key findings, and attempt to express an appropriate measure of the uncertainty that accompanies these findings using a shared guidance procedure. This process has changed over time. The early Assessment Reports  were largely qualitative. As the field has grown and matured, uncertainty is being treated more explicitly, with a greater emphasis on the expression, where possible and appropriate, of quantified measures of uncertainty. Although IPCC's treatment of uncertainty has become more sophisticated since the early reports, the rapid growth and considerable diversity of climate research literature presents ongoing challenges. In the wake of the TAR the IPCC formed a Cross-Working Group team charged with identifying the issues and compiling a set of Uncertainty Guidance Notes that could provide a structure for consistent treatment of uncertainty across the IPCC's remit . These expanded on the procedural elements of Moss and Schneider  and introduced calibrated language scales designed to enable chapter teams to use the appropriate level of precision to describe findings. These notes were revised between the TAR and AR4 and again between AR4 and AR5 . Recently, increased engagement of social scientists  and expert advisory panels  in the area of uncertainty and climate change has helped clarify issues	0
and procedures to improve presentation of uncertainty. Many of the recommendations of these groups are addressed in the revised Guidance Notes. One key revision relates to clarification of the relationship between the `confidence' and `likelihood' language, and pertains to demarcation between qualitative descriptions of `confidence' and the numerical representations of uncertainty that are expressed by the likelihood scale. In addition, a finding that includes a probabilistic measure of uncertainty does not require explicit mention of the level of confidence associated with that finding if the level of confidence is high or very high. This is a concession to stylistic clarity and readability: if something is described as having a high likelihood, then in the absence of additional qualifiers it should be inferred that it also has high or very high confidence.	0
A level of confidence synthesizes the Chapter teams' judgements about the validity of findings as determined through evaluation of the available evidence and the degree of scientific agreement. The evidence and agreement scale underpins the assessment, as it is on the basis of evidence and agreement that statements can be made with scientific confidence . There is flexibility in this relationship; for a given evidence and agreement statement, different confidence levels could be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing confidence. Confidence cannot n ecessarily be assigned for all combinations of evidence and agreement, but where key variables are highly uncertain, the available evidence and scientific agreement regarding that variable are presented and discussed. Confidence should not be interpreted probabilistically, and it is distinct from `statistical confidence'. The confidence level is based on the evidence  and the agreement . A combination of different methods, e.g., observations and modelling, is important for evaluating the confidence level. Figure 1.11 shows how the combined evidence and agreement results in five levels for the confidence level used in this assessment. The qualifier `likelihood' provides calibrated language for describing quantified uncertainty. It can be used to express a probabilistic estimate of the occurrence of a single event or of an outcome, for example, a climate parameter, observed trend, or projected change 139	0
The models used to calculate the IPCC's temperature projections agree on the direction of future global change, but the projected size of those changes cannot be precisely predicted. Future greenhouse gas  emission rates could take any one of many possible trajectories, and some underlying physical processes are not yet completely understood, making them difficult to model. Those uncertainties, combined with natural year-to-year climate variability, produce an `uncertainty range' in temperature projections. The uncertainty range around projected GHG and aerosol precursor emissions  cannot be materially reduced. Nevertheless, improved understanding and climate models--along with observational constraints--may reduce the uncertainty range around some factors that influence the climate's response to those emission changes. The complexity of the climate system, however, makes this a slow process.  Climate science has made many important advances since the last IPCC assessment report, thanks to improvements in measurements and data analysis in the cryosphere, atmosphere, land, biosphere and ocean systems. Scientists also have better understanding and tools to model the role of clouds, sea ice, aerosols, small-scale ocean mixing, the carbon cycle and other processes. More observations mean that models can now be evaluated more thoroughly, and projections can be better constrained. For example, as models and observational analysis have improved, projections of sea level rise have become more accurate, balancing the current sea level rise budget. Despite these advances, there is still a range in plausible projections for future global and regional climate-- what scientists call an `uncertainty range'. These uncertainty ranges are specific to the variable being considered  and the spatial and temporal extent . Uncertainties in climate projections arise from natural variability and uncertainty around the rate of future emissions and the climate's response to them. They can also occur because representations of some known processes are as yet unrefined, and because some processes are not included in the models. There are fundamental limits to just how precisely annual temperatures can be projected, because of the chaotic nature of the climate system. Furthermore, decadal-scale projections are sensitive to prevailing conditions--such as the temperature of the deep ocean--that are less well known. Some natural variability over decades arises from interactions between the ocean, atmosphere, land, biosphere and cryosphere, and is also linked to phenomena such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation  and the North Atlantic Oscillation . Volcanic eruptions and variations in the sun's output also contribute to natural variability, although they are externally forced and explainable. This natural variability can be viewed as part of the `noise' in the climate record, which provides the backdrop against which the `signal' of anthropogenic climate change is detected. Natural variability has a greater influence on uncertainty at regional and local scales than it does over continental or global scales. It is inherent in the Earth system, and more knowledge will not eliminate the uncertainties it brings. However, some progress is possible--particularly for projections up to a few years ahead--which exploit advances in knowledge of, for instance, the cryosphere or ocean state and processes. This is an area of active research. When climate variables are averaged over decadal timescales or longer, the relative importance of internal variability diminishes, making the long-term signals more evident . This long-term perspective is consistent with a common definition of climate as an average over 30 years. A second source of uncertainty stems from the many possible trajectories that future emission rates of GHGs and aerosol precursors might take, and from future trends in land use. Nevertheless, climate projections rely on input from these variables. So to obtain these estimates, scientists consider a number of alternative scenarios for future human society, in terms of population, economic and technological change, and political choices. They then estimate the likely emissions under each scenario. The IPCC informs policymaking, therefore climate projections for different emissions scenarios can be useful as they show the possible climatic consequences of different policy choices. These scenarios are intended to be compatible with the full range of emissions scenarios described in the current scientific literature, with or without climate policy. As such, they are designed to sample uncertainty in future scenarios.  140	0
The final contribution to the uncertainty range comes from our imperfect knowledge of how the climate will respond to future anthropogenic emissions and land use change. Scientists principally use computer-based global climate models to estimate this response. A few dozen global climate models have been developed by different groups of scientists around the world. All models are built on the same physical principles, but some approximations are needed because the climate system is so complex. Different groups choose slightly different approximations to represent specific processes in the atmosphere, such as clouds. These choices produce differences in climate projections from different models. This contribution to the uncertainty range is described as `response uncertainty' or `model uncertainty'. The complexity of the Earth system means that future climate could follow many different scenarios, yet still be consistent with current understanding and models. As observational records lengthen and models improve, researchers should be able, within the limitations of the range of natural variability, to narrow that range in probable temperature in the next few decades . It is also possible to use information about the current state of the oceans and cryosphere to produce better projections up to a few years ahead.	0
FAQ 1.1, Figure 1 | Schematic diagram showing the relative importance of different uncertainties, and their evolution in time.  Decadal mean surface temperature change  from the historical record , with climate model estimates of uncertainty for historical period , along with future climate projections and uncertainty. Values are normalised by means from 1961 to 1980. Natural variability  derives from model interannual variability, and is assumed constant with time. Emission uncertainty  is estimated as the model mean difference in projections from different scenarios. Climate response uncertainty  is based on climate model spread, along with added uncertainties from the carbon cycle, as well as rough estimates of additional uncertainty from poorly modelled processes. Based on Hawkins and Sutton  and Huntingford et al. .  Climate response uncertainty can appear to increase when a new process is discovered to be relevant, but such increases reflect a quantification of previously unmeasured uncertainty, or  can decrease with additional model improvements and observational constraints. The given uncertainty range of 90% means that the temperature is estimated to be in that range, with a probability of 90%.	0
lying in a given range. Statements made using the likelihood scale may be based on statistical or modelling analyses, elicitation of expert views, or other quantitative analyses. Where sufficient information is available it is preferable to eschew the likelihood qualifier in favour of the full probability distribution or the appropriate probability range. See Table 1.2 for the list of `likelihood' qualifiers to be used in AR5. Many social sciences studies have found that the interpretation of uncertainty is contingent on the presentation of information, the context within which statements are placed and the interpreter's own lexical preferences. Readers often adjust their interpretation of probabilistic language according to the magnitude of perceived potential consequences . Furthermore, the framing of a probabilistic statement impinges on how it is interpreted : for example, a 10% chance of dying is interpreted more negatively than a 90% chance of surviving. In addition, work examining expert judgement and decision making shows that people--including scientific experts--are prone to a range of heuristics and biases that affect their judgement . For example, in the case of expert judgements there is a tendency towards overconfidence both at the individual level  and at the group level as people converge on a view and draw confidence in its reliability from each other. However, in an assessment of the state of scientific knowledge across a field Table 1.2 | Likelihood terms associated with outcomes used in the AR5.	0
These issues were brought to the attention of chapter teams so that contributors to the AR5 might be sensitized to the ways presentation, framing, context and potential biases might affect their own assessments and might contribute to readers' understanding of the information presented in this assessment. There will always be room for debate about how to summarize such a large and growing literature. The uncertainty guidance is aimed at providing a consistent, calibrated set of words through which to communicate the uncertainty, confidence and degree of consensus prevailing in the scientific literature. In this sense the guidance notes and practices adopted by IPCC for the p resentation of uncertainties should be regarded as an interdisciplinary work in progress, rather than as a finalized, comprehensive approach. Moreover, one precaution that should be considered is that translation of this assessment from English to other languages may lead to a loss of precision.	0
Improved understanding and systematic monitoring of Earth's climate requires observations of various atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial parameters and therefore has to rely on various technologies . The Global Climate Observing System  defined a list of so-called Essential Climate Variables, that are technically and economically feasible to observe, but some of the associated observing systems are not yet operated in a systematic manner. However, during recent years, new observational systems have increased the number of observations by orders of magnitude and observations have been made at places where there have been no data before . Parallel to this, tools to analyse and process the data have been developed and enhanced to cope with the increase of information and to provide a more comprehensive picture of the Earth's climate. At the same time, it should be kept in mind that there has been some limited progress in developing countries in filling gaps in their in situ observing networks, but developed countries have made little progress in ensuring long-term continuity for several important observing systems . In addition, more proxy  data have been acquired to provide a more comprehensive picture of climate changes in the past . Efforts are also occurring to digitize historic observations, mainly of ground-station data from periods prior to the second half of the 20th century .	0
Reanalysis is a systematic approach to produce gridded dynamically consistent data sets for climate monitoring and research by assimilating all available observations with help of a climate model . Model-based reanalysis products play an important role in obtaining a consistent picture of the climate system. However, their usefulness in detecting long-term climate trends is currently limited by changes over time in observational coverage and biases, linked to the presence of biases in the assimilating model . Because AR4 both the quantity and quality of the observations that are assimilated through reanalysis have increased . As an example, there has been some overall increase in mostly atmospheric observations assimilated in European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis since 2007 . The overwhelming majority of the data, and most of the increase over recent years, come from satellites  . For	0
example, information from Global Positioning System radio occultation measurements has increased significantly since 2007. The increases in data from fixed stations are often associated with an increased frequency of reporting, rather than an increase in the number of stations. Increases in data quality come from improved instrument design or from more accurate correction in the ground-station processing that is applied before the data are transmitted to users and data centres. As an example for in situ data, temperature biases of radiosonde measurements from radiation effects have been reduced over recent years. The new generation of satellite sensors such as the high spectral r esolution infrared sounders  are instrumental to achieving a better temporal stability for recalibrating sensors such as the High-Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder. Few instruments  have now been 143	0
A major achievement in ocean observation is due to the implementation of the Argo global array of profiling floats system . Deployment of Argo floats began in 2000, but it took until 2007 for numbers to reach the design target of 3000 floats. Since 2000 the icefree upper 2000 m of the ocean have been observed systematically for temperature and salinity for the first time in history, because both the Argo profiling float and surface drifting buoy arrays have reached global coverage at their target numbers . Biases in historical ocean data have been identified and reduced, and new analytical approaches have been applied . One major consequence has been the reduction of an artificial decadal variation in upper ocean temperature and heat content that was apparent in the observational assessment for AR4 . The spatial and temporal coverage of biogeochemical measurements in the ocean has also expanded. Satellite observations for sea level , sea surface salinity , sea ice  and ocean colour have also been further developed over the past few years.	0
Progress has also been made with regard to observation of terrestrial Essential Climate Variables. Major advances have been achieved in remote sensing of soil moisture due to the launch of the Soil Moisture and Oceanic Salinity mission in 2009 but also due to new retrieval techniques that have been applied to data from earlier and ongoing missions . However, these measurements have limitations. For example, the methods fail under dense vegetation and they are restricted to the surface soil. Updated Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-based Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index data provide new information on the change in vegetation. During the International Polar Year 2007-2009 the number of borehole sites was significantly increased and therefore allows a better monitoring of the large-scale permafrost features .	0
Representations of Earth system processes are much more extensive and improved, particularly for the radiation and the aerosol cloud interactions and for the treatment of the cryosphere. The representation of the carbon cycle was added to a larger number of models and has been improved since AR4. A high-resolution stratosphere is now included in many models. Other ongoing process development in climate models includes the enhanced representation of nitrogen effects on the carbon cycle. As new processes or treatments are added to the models, they are also evaluated and tested relative to available observations . 145	0
Ensemble techniques  are being used more frequently, with larger samples and with different methods to generate the samples . Coordinated projects have been set up to generate and distribute large samples . The model comparisons with observations have pushed the analysis and development of the models. CMIP5, an important input to the AR5, has produced a multi-model data set that is designed to advance our understanding of climate variability and climate change. Building on previous CMIP efforts, such as the CMIP3 model analysis reported in AR4, CMIP5 includes `long-term' simulations of 20th century climate and projections for the 21st century and beyond. See Chapters 9, 10, 11 and 12 for more details on the results derived from the CMIP5 archive. Since AR4, the incorporation of `long-term' paleoclimate simulations in the CMIP5 framework has allowed incorporation of information from paleoclimate data to inform projections. Within uncertainties associated with reconstructions of past climate variables from proxy records and forcings, paleoclimate information from the Mid Holocene, Last Glacial Maximum and Last Millennium have been used to test the ability of models to simulate realistically the magnitude and largescale patterns of past changes .	0
The capabilities of ESMs continue to be enhanced. For example, there are currently extensive efforts towards developing advanced treatments for the processes affecting ice sheet dynamics. Other enhancements are being aimed at land surface hydrology, and the effects of agriculture and urban environments. As part of the process of getting model analyses for a range of alternative assumptions about how the future may unfold, scenarios for future emissions of important gases and aerosols have been generated for the IPCC assessments . The emissions scenarios represent various development pathways based on well-defined assumptions. The scenarios are used to calculate future changes in climate, and are then archived in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project . For CMIP5, four new scenarios, referred to as Representative Concentration Pathways  were developed . See Box 1.1 for a more thorough discussion of the RCP scenarios. Because results from both CMIP3 and CMIP5 will be presented in the later chapters , it is worthwhile considering the differences and similarities between the SRES and the RCP scenarios. Figure 1.15, acting as a prelude to the discussion in Box 1.1, shows that the RF for several of the SRES and RCP scenarios are similar over time and thus should provide results that can be used to compare climate modelling studies.	0
Box 1.1 | Description of Future Scenarios Long-term climate change projections require assumptions on human activities or natural effects that could alter the climate over decades and centuries. Defined scenarios are useful for a variety of reasons, e.g., assuming specific time series of emissions, land use, atmospheric concentrations or RF across multiple models allows for coherent climate model intercomparisons and synthesis. Scenarios can be formed in a range of ways, from simple, idealized structures to inform process understanding, through to comprehensive scenarios produced by Integrated Assessment Models  as internally consistent sets of assumptions on emissions and socioeconomic drivers .	0
Idealized Concentration Scenarios As one example of an idealized concentration scenario, a 1% yr-1 compound increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration until a doubling or a quadrupling of its initial value has been widely used in the past . An exponential increase of CO2 concentrations induces an essentially linear increase in RF  due to a `saturation effect' of the strong absorbing bands. Such a linear ramp function is highly useful for comparative diagnostics of models' climate feedbacks and inertia. The CMIP5 intercomparison project again includes such a stylized pathway up to a quadrupling of CO2 concentrations, in addition to an instantaneous quadrupling case. The Socio-Economic Driven SRES Scenarios The SRES suite of scenarios were developed using IAMs and resulted from specific socio-economic scenarios from storylines about future demographic and economic development, regionalization, energy production and use, technology, agriculture, forestry and land use . The climate change projections undertaken as part of CMIP3 and discussed in AR4 were based primarily on the SRES A2, A1B and B1 scenarios. However, given the diversity in models' carbon cycle and chemistry schemes, this approach implied differences in models' long lived GHG and aerosol concentrations for the same emissions scenario. As a result of this and other shortcomings, revised scenarios were developed for AR5 to allow atmosphere-ocean general circulation model   simulations to be compared with those ESM simulations that use emissions to calculate concentrations. Representative Concentration Pathway Scenarios and Their Extensions Representative Concentration Pathway  scenarios  are new scenarios that specify concentrations and corresponding emissions, but are not directly based on socio-economic storylines like the SRES scenarios. The RCP scenarios are based on a different approach and include more consistent short-lived gases and land use changes. They are not necessarily more capable of representing future developments than the SRES scenarios. Four RCP scenarios were selected from the published literature  and updated for use within CMIP5 . The four scenarios are identified by the 21st century peak or stabilization value of the RF derived by the reference model  : the lowest RCP, RCP2.6  History	0
Box 1.1, Figure 1 | Total RF  for RCPs and extended concentration pathways --for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP6, RCP8.5, as well as a supplementary extension RCP6 to 4.5 with an adjustment of emissions after 2100 to reach RCP4.5 concentration levels in 2250 and thereafter. Note that the stated RF levels refer to the illustrative default median estimates only. There is substantial uncertainty in current and future RF levels for any given scenario. Short-term variations in RF are due to both volcanic forcings in the past  and cyclical solar forcing assuming a constant 11-year solar cycle , except at times of stabilization. 	0
RCP3-PD) which peaks at 3 W m-2 and then declines to approximately 2.6 W m-2 by 2100; the medium-low RCP4.5 and the mediumhigh RCP6 aiming for stabilization at 4.5 and 6 W m-2, respectively around 2100; and the highest one, RCP8.5, which implies a RF of 8.5 W m-2 by 2100, but implies rising RF beyond that date . In addition there is a supplementary extension SCP6to4.5 with an adjustment of emissions after 2100 to reach RCP 4.5 concentration levels in 2250 and thereafter. The RCPs span the full range of RF associated with emission scenarios published in the peer-reviewed literature at the time of the development of the RCPs, and the two middle scenarios where chosen to be roughly equally spaced between the two extremes . These forcing values should be understood as comparative labels representative of the forcing associated with each scenario, which will vary somewhat from model to model. This is because concentrations or emissions  are prescribed in the CMIP5 climate model runs.	0
Various steps were necessary to turn the selected `raw' RCPs into emission scenarios from IAMs and to turn these into data sets usable by the climate modelling community, including the extension with historical emissions , the harmonization  and gridding of land use data sets , the provision of atmospheric chemistry modelling studies, particularly for tropospheric ozone , analyses of 2000-2005 GHG emission levels, and extension of GHG concentrations with historical GHG concentrations and harmonization with analyses of 2000- 2005 GHG concentrations levels . The final RCP data sets comprise land use data, harmonized GHG emissions and concentrations, gridded reactive gas and aerosol emissions, as well as ozone and aerosol abundance fields . 	0
To aid model understanding of longer-term climate change implications, these RCPs were extended until 2300  under reasonably simple and somewhat arbitrary assumptions regarding post-2100 GHG emissions and concentrations. In order to continue to investigate a broad range of possible climate futures, the two outer RCPs, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 assume constant emissions after 2100, while the two middle RCPs aim for a smooth stabilization of concentrations by 2150. RCP8.5 stabilizes concentrations only by 2250, with CO2 concentrations of approximately 2000 ppm, nearly seven times the pre-industrial levels. As the RCP2.6 implies netnegative CO2 emissions after around 2070 and throughout the extension, CO2 concentrations are slowly reduced towards 360 ppm by 2300. Comparison of SRES and RCP Scenarios The four RCP scenarios used in CMIP5 lead to RF values that span a range larger than that of the three SRES scenarios used in CMIP3 . RCP4.5 is close to SRES B1, RCP6 is close to SRES A1B  and RCP8.5 is somewhat higher than A2 in 2100 and close to the SRES A1FI scenario . RCP2.6 is lower than any of the SRES scenarios . 	0
As this chapter has shown, understanding of the climate system and the changes occurring in it continue to advance. The notable scientific advances and associated peer-reviewed publications since AR4 provide the basis for the assessment of the science as found in Chapters 2 to 14. Below a quick summary of these chapters and their objectives is provided. Observations and Paleoclimate Information : These chapters assess information from all climate system components on climate variability and change as obtained from instrumental records and climate archives. This group of chapters covers all relevant aspects of the atmosphere including the stratosphere, the land surface, the oceans and the cryosphere. Information on the water cycle, including evaporation, precipitation, runoff, soil moisture, floods, drought, etc. is assessed. Timescales from daily to decades  and from centuries to many millennia  are considered. Process Understanding : These chapters cover all relevant aspects from observations and process understanding, to projections from global to regional scale. Chapter 6 covers the carbon cycle and its interactions with other biogeochemical cycles, in particular the nitrogen cycle, as well as feedbacks on the climate system. Chapter 7 treats in detail clouds and aerosols, their interactions and chemistry, the role of water vapour, as well as their role in feedbacks on the climate system. From Forcing to Attribution of Climate Change : In these chapters, all the information on the different drivers  of climate change is collected, expressed in terms of RF, and assessed . As part of this, the science of metrics commonly used in the literature to compare radiative effects from a range of agents  is covered. In Chapter 9, the hierarchy of climate models used in simulating past and present climate change is assessed. Information regarding detection and attribution of changes on global to regional scales is assessed in Chapter 10. Future Climate Change and Predictability : These chapters assess projections of future climate change derived from climate models on timescales from decades to centuries at both global and regional scales, including mean changes, variability and extremes. Fundamental questions related to the predictability of climate as well as long-term climate change, climate change commitments and inertia in the climate system are addressed.	0
AR4: The temperature projections of the AR4 are presented for three SRES scenarios: B1, A1B and A2. Annual mean anomalies relative to 1961-1990 of the individual CMIP3 ensemble simulations  are shown. One outlier has been eliminated based on the advice of the model developers because of the model drift that leads to an unrealistic temperature evolution. As assessed by Meehl et al. , the likely range for the temperature change is given by the ensemble mean temperature change +60% and -40% of the ensemble mean temperature change. Note that in the AR4 the uncertainty range was explicitly estimated for the end of the 21st century results. Here, it is shown for 2035. The time dependence of this range has been assessed in Knutti et al. . The relative uncertainty is approximately constant over time in all estimates from different sources, except for the very early decades when natural variability is being considered .	0
Data Processing Observations The observations are shown from 1950 to 2012 as annual mean anomaly relative to 1961-1990 . For smoothing, first, the trend of each of the observational data sets was calculated by locally weighted scatter plot smoothing . Then, the 11-year running means of the residuals were determined with reflected ends for the last 5 years. Finally, the trend was added back to the 11-year running means of the residuals. Projections For FAR, SAR and TAR, the projections have been harmonized to match the average of the three smoothed observational data sets at 1990.	0
AR4: The AR4 did not give a time-dependent estimate of sea level rise. These analyses have been conducted post AR4 by Church et al.  based on the CMIP3 model results that were available at the time of AR4. Here, the SRES B1, A1B and A2 scenarios are shown from Church et al. . The data start in 2001 and are given as anomalies with respect to 1990. They are displayed from 2001 to 2035, but the anomalies are harmonized to start from mean of the observed anomaly relative to 1961-1990 at 1990 .	0
Atmospheric Composition It is certain that atmospheric burdens of the well-mixed greenhouse gases  targeted by the Kyoto Protocol increased from 2005 to 2011. The atmospheric abundance of carbon dioxide  was 390.5 ppm 1 in 2011; this is 40% greater than in 1750. Atmospheric nitrous oxide  was 324.2 ppb  in 2011 and has increased by 20% since 1750. Average annual increases in CO2 and N2O from 2005 to 2011 are comparable to those observed from 1996 to 2005. Atmospheric methane  was 1803.2 ppb  in 2011; this is 150% greater than before 1750. CH4 began increasing in 2007 after remaining nearly constant from 1999 to 2006. Hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons , and sulphur hexafluoride  all continue to increase relatively rapidly, but their contributions to radiative forcing are less than 1% of the total by well-mixed GHGs. Confidence is medium in large-scale increases of tropospheric ozone across the Northern Hemisphere  since the 1970s.	0
Confidence is low in ozone changes across the Southern Hemisphere  owing to limited measurements. It is likely3 that surface ozone trends in eastern North America and Western Europe since 2000 have levelled off or decreased and that surface ozone strongly increased in East Asia since the 1990s. Satellite and surface observations of ozone precursor gases NOx, CO, and non-methane volatile organic carbons indicate strong regional differences in trends. Most notably NO2 has likely decreased by 30 to 50% in Europe and North America and increased by more than a factor of 2 in Asia since the mid-1990s. 	0
about 0.72C  over the period 1951-2012. The total increase between the average of the 1850-1900 period and the 2003- 2012 period is 0.78  C and the total increase between the average of the 1850-1900 period and the reference period for projections, 1986-2005, is 0.61  C, based on the single longest dataset available. For the longest period when calculation of regional trends is sufficiently complete , almost the entire globe has experienced surface warming. In addition to robust multidecadal warming, global mean surface temperature exhibits substantial decadal and interannual variability. Owing to natural variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends. As one example, the rate of warming over the past 15 years  C per decade), which begins with a strong El Nino, is smaller than the rate calculated since 1951  C per decade). Trends for 15-year periods starting in 1995, 1996, and 1997 are 0.13 , 0.14  and 0.07 , respectively. Several independently analyzed data records of global and regional land-surface air temperature  obtained from station observations are in broad agreement that LSAT has increased. Sea surface temperatures  have also increased. Intercomparisons of new SST data records obtained by different measurement methods, including satellite data, have resulted in better understanding of uncertainties and biases in the records. 	0
Extreme Events It is very likely that the numbers of cold days and nights have decreased and the numbers of warm days and nights have increased globally since about 1950. There is only medium confidence that the length and frequency of warm spells, including heat waves, has increased since the middle of the 20th century mostly owing to lack of data or of studies in Africa and South America. However, it is likely that heatwave frequency has increased during this period in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. Confidence in large-scale trends in storminess or storminess proxies over the last century is low owing to inconsistencies	0
As described in AR4 , the climate comprises a variety of space- and timescales: from the diurnal cycle, to interannual variability such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation , to multi-decadal variations. `Climate change' refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period of time . In this chapter, climate change is examined for the period with instrumental observations, since about 1850. Change prior to this date is assessed in Chapter 5. The word `trend' is used to designate a long-term movement in a time series that may be regarded, together with the oscillation and random component, as composing the observed values . Where numerical values are given, they are equivalent linear changes , though more complex nonlinear changes in the variable will often be clear from the description and plots of the time series. In recent decades, advances in the global climate observing system have contributed to improved monitoring capabilities. In particular, satellites provide additional observations of climate change, which have been assessed in this and subsequent chapters together with more traditional ground-based and radiosonde observations. Since AR4, substantial developments have occurred including the production of revised data sets, more digital data records, and new data set efforts. New dynamical reanalysis data sets of the global atmosphere have been published . These various innovations have improved understanding of data issues and uncertainties . Developing homogeneous long-term records from these different sources remains a challenge. The longest observational series are land surface air temperatures  and sea surface temperatures . Like all physical climate system measurements, they suffer from non-climatic artefacts that must be taken into account . The global combined LSAT and SST remains an important climate change measure for several reasons. Climate sensitivity is typically assessed in the context of global mean surface temperature  responses to a doubling of CO2  and GMST is thus a key metric in the climate change policy framework. Also, because it extends back in time farther than any other global instrumental series, GMST is key to understanding both the causes of change and the patterns, role and magnitude of natural variability . Starting at various points in the 20th century, additional observations, including balloon-borne measurements and satellite measurements, and reanalysis products allow analyses of indicators such as atmospheric composition, radiation budgets, hydrological cycle changes, extreme event characterizations and circulation indices. A full understanding of the climate system characteristics and changes requires analyses of all such variables as well as ocean  and cryosphere  indicators. Through such a holistic analysis, a clearer and more robust assessment of the changing climate system emerges . 164	0
This chapter starts with an assessment of the observations of the abundances of greenhouse gases  and of aerosols, the main drivers of climate change . Global trends in GHGs are indicative of the imbalance between sources and sinks in GHG budgets, and play an important role in emissions verification on a global scale. The radiative forcing  effects of GHGs and aerosols are assessed in Chapter 8. The observed changes in radiation budgets are discussed in Section 2.3. Aerosol-cloud interactions are assessed in Chapter 7. Section 2.4 provides an assessment of observed changes in surface and atmospheric temperature. Observed change in the hydrological cycle, including precipitation and clouds, is assessed in Section 2.5. Changes in variability and extremes  are assessed in Section 2.6. Section 2.7 assesses observed changes in the circulation of the atmosphere and its modes of variability, which help determine seasonal and longer-term anomalies at regional scales . Trends have been assessed where possible for multi-decadal periods starting in 1880, 1901  and in 1951, 1979 . The time elapsed since AR4 extends the period for trend calculation from 2005 to 2012 for many variables. The GMST trend since 1998 has also been considered  as well as the trends for sequential 30-year segments of the time series. For many variables derived from satellite data, information is available for 1979-2012 only. In general, trend estimates are more reliable for longer time intervals, and trends computed on short intervals have a large uncertainty. Trends for short intervals are very sensitive to the start and end years. An exception to this is trends in GHGs, whose accurate measurement and long lifetimes make them well-mixed and less susceptible to year-to-year variability, so that trends computed on relatively short intervals are very meaningful for these variables. Where possible, the time interval 1961-1990 has been chosen as the climatological reference period  for averaging. This choice enables direct comparisons with AR4, but is different from the present-day climate period  used as a reference in the modelling chapters of AR5 and Annex I: Atlas of Global and Regional Climate Projections. It is important to note that the question of whether the observed changes are outside the possible range of natural internal climate variability and consistent with the climate effects from changes in atmospheric composition is not addressed in this chapter, but rather in Chapter 10. No attempt has been undertaken to further describe and interpret the observed changes in terms of multi-decadal oscillatory  variations,  persistence and/or secular trends . In this chapter, the robustness of the observed changes is assessed in relation to various sources of observational uncertainty . In addition, the reported trend significance and statistical confidence intervals provide an indication of how large the observed trend is compared to the range of observed variability in a given aspect of the climate system . Unless otherwise stated, 90% confidence intervals are given. The chapter also examines the physical consistency across	0
is an increase in the average growth rate of atmospheric methane  from ~0.5 ppb yr-1 during 1999-2006 to ~6 ppb yr-1 from 2007 through 2011. Current observation networks are sufficient to quantify global annual mean burdens used to calculate RF and to constrain global emission rates , but they are not sufficient for accurately estimating regional scale emissions and how they are changing with time. The globally, annually averaged well-mixed GHG mole fractions reported here are used in Chapter 8 to calculate RF. A direct, inseparable connection exists between observed changes in atmospheric composition and well-mixed GHG emissions and losses . A global GHG budget consists of the total atmospheric burden, total global rate of production or emission , and the total global rate of destruction or removal . Precise, accurate systematic observations from independent globally distributed measurement networks are used to estimate global annual mean well-mixed GHG mole fractions at the Earth's surface, and these allow estimates of global burdens. Emissions are predominantly from surface sources, which are described in C  hapter 6 for CO2, CH4, and N2O. Direct	0
Box 2.1 | Uncertainty in Observational Records The vast majority of historical  weather observations were not made explicitly for climate monitoring purposes. Measurements have changed in nature as demands on the data, observing practices and technologies have evolved. These changes almost always alter the characteristics of observational records, changing their mean, their variability or both, such that it is necessary to process the raw measurements before they can be considered useful for assessing the true climate evolution. This is true of all observing techniques that measure physical atmospheric quantities. The uncertainty in observational records encompasses instrumental/ recording errors, effects of representation , as well as effects due to physical changes in the instrumentation . All further processing steps  also have their own particular uncertainties. Because there is no unique, unambiguous, way to identify and account for non-climatic artefacts in the vast majority of records, there must be a degree of uncertainty as to how the climate system has changed. The only exceptions are certain atmospheric composition and flux measurements whose measurements and uncertainties are rigorously tied through an unbroken chain to internationally recognized absolute measurement standards . Uncertainty in data set production can result either from the choice of parameters within a particular analytical framework--parametric uncertainty, or from the choice of overall analytical framework-- structural uncertainty. Structural uncertainty is best estimated by having multiple independent groups assess the same data using distinct approaches. More analyses assessed now than in AR4 include published estimates of parametric or structural uncertainty. It is important to note that the literature includes a very broad range of approaches. Great care has been taken in comparing the published uncertainty ranges as they almost always do not constitute a likefor-like comparison. In general, studies that account for multiple potential error sources in a rigorous manner yield larger uncertainty ranges. This yields an apparent paradox in interpretation as one might think that smaller uncertainty ranges should indicate a better product. However, in many cases this would be an incorrect inference as the smaller uncertainty range may instead reflect that the published estimate considered only a subset of the plausible sources of uncertainty. Within the timeseries figures, where this issue would be most acute, such parametric uncertainty estimates are therefore not generally included. Consistent with AR4 HadCRUT4 uncertainties in GMST are included in Figure 2.19, which in addition includes structural uncertainties in GMST. To conclude, the vast majority of the raw observations used to monitor the state of the climate contain residual non-climatic influences. Removal of these influences cannot be done definitively and neither can the uncertainties be unambiguously assessed. Therefore, care is required in interpreting both data products and their stated uncertainty estimates. Confidence can be built from: redundancy in efforts to create products; data set heritage; and cross-comparisons of variables that would be expected to co-vary for physical reasons, such as LSATs and SSTs around coastlines. Finally, trends are often quoted as a way to synthesize the data into a single number. Uncertainties that arise from such a process and the choice of technique used within this chapter are described in more detail in Box 2.2. 165	0
Systematic measurements of well-mixed GHG in ambient air began at various times during the last six decades, with earlier atmospheric histories being reconstructed from measurements of air stored in air archives and trapped in polar ice cores or in firn. In contrast to the physical meteorological parameters discussed elsewhere in this chapter, measurements of well-mixed GHG are reported relative to standards developed from fundamental SI base units  as dry-air mole fractions, a unit that is conserved with changes in temperature and pressure . This eliminates dilution by H2O vapour, which can reach 4% of total atmospheric composition. Here, the following abbreviations are used: ppm = mol mol-1; ppb = nmol mol-1; and ppt = pmol mol-1. Unless noted otherwise, averages of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  and Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment  annually averaged surface global mean mole fractions is described in Section 2.2.1 .	0
Globally averaged CH4 in 1750 was 722  25 ppb  , although human influences on the global CH4 budget may have begun thousands of years earlier than this time that is normally considered `pre-industrial' . In 2011, the global annual mean was 1803  2 ppb. Direct atmospheric measurements of CH4 of sufficient spatial coverage to calculate global annual means began in 1978 and are plotted through 2011 in Figure 2.2a. This time period is characterized by a decreasing growth rate  from the early 1980s until 1998, stabilization from 1999 to 2006, and an increasing atmospheric burden from 2007 to 2011 (Rigby et al., 2008; Dlugokencky et al.,	0
are plotted in Figure 2.1. The main features in the contemporary CO2 record are the long-term increase and the seasonal cycle resulting from photosynthesis and respiration by the terrestrial biosphere, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere . The main contributors to increasing atmospheric CO2 abundance are fossil fuel combustion and land use change . Multiple lines of observational evidence indicate that during the past few decades, most of the increasing atmospheric burden of CO2 is from fossil fuel combustion . Since the last year for which the AR4 reported , CO2 has increased by 11.7 ppm to 390.5 ppm in 2011 . From 1980 to 2011, the average annual increase in globally averaged CO2  was 1.7 ppm yr-1 . Since 2001, CO2 has increased at 2.0 ppm yr-1 . The CO2 growth rate varies from year to year; since 1980 the range in annual increase is 0.7  0.1 ppm in 1992 to 2.9  0.1 ppm in 1998. Most of this interannual variability in growth rate is driven by small changes in the balance between photosynthesis and respiration on land, each having global fluxes of ~120 PgC yr-1 .	0
2009). Assuming no long-term trend in hydroxyl radical  concentration, the observed decrease in CH4 growth rate from the early 1980s through 2006 indicates an approach to steady state where total global emissions have been approximately constant at ~550 Tg  yr-1. Superimposed on the long-term pattern is significant interannual variability; studies of this variability are used to improve understanding of the global CH4 budget . The most likely drivers of increased atmospheric CH4 were anomalously high temperatures in the Arctic in 2007 and greater than average precipitation in the tropics during 2007 and 2008 . Observations of the difference in CH4 between zonal averages for northern and southern polar regions   suggest that, so far, it is unlikely that there has been a permanent measureable increase in Arctic CH4 emissions from wetlands and shallow sub-sea CH4 clathrates. Reaction with the hydroxyl radical  is the main loss process for CH4  and hydrochlorofluorocarbons ), and it is the largest term in the global CH4 budget. Therefore, trends and interannual variability in OH concentration significantly impact our understanding of changes in CH4 emissions. Methyl chloroform  has been used extensively to estimate globally averaged OH concentrations . AR4 reported no trend in OH from 1979 to 2004, and there is no evidence from this assessment to change that conclusion for 2005 to 2011. Montzka et al.  exploited the exponential decrease and small emissions in CH3CCl3 to show that interannual variations in OH concentration from 1998 to 2007 are 2.3  1.5%, which is consistent with estimates based on CH4, tetrachloroethene , dichloromethane , chloromethane  and bromomethane . 	0
of 20% over the estimate for 1750 from ice cores, 270  7 ppb . Measurements of N2O and its isotopic composition in firn air suggest the increase, at least since the early 1950s, is dominated by emissions from soils treated with synthetic and organic  nitrogen fertilizer . Since systematic measurements began in the late 1970s, N2O has increased at an average rate of ~0.75 ppb yr-1 . Because the atmospheric burden of CFC-12 is decreasing, N2O has replaced CFC-12 as the third most important well-mixed GHG contributing to RF . Persistent latitudinal gradients in annually averaged N2O are observed at background surface sites, with maxima in the northern subtropics, values about 1.7 ppb lower in the Antarctic, and values about 0.4 ppb lower in the Arctic . These persistent gradients contain information about anthropogenic emissions from fertilizer use at northern tropical to mid-latitudes and natural emissions from soils and ocean upwelling regions of the tropics. N2O time series also contain seasonal variations with peak-to-peak amplitudes of about 1 ppb in high latitudes of the NH and about 0.4 ppb at high southern and tropical latitudes. In the NH, exchange of air between the stratosphere  and troposphere is the dominant contributor to observed seasonal cycles, not seasonality in emissions . Nevison et al.  found correlations between the magnitude of detrended N2O seasonal minima and lower stratospheric temperature, providing evidence for a stratospheric influence on the timing and amplitude of the seasonal cycle at surface monitoring sites. In the Southern Hemisphere , observed seasonal cycles are also affected by stratospheric influx, and by ventilation and thermal out-gassing of N2O from the oceans. 	0
HFC-134a is a replacement for CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners and is also used in foam blowing applications. In 2011, it reached 62.7 ppt, an increase of 28.2 ppt since 2005. Based on analysis of high-frequency measurements, the largest emissions occur in North America, Europe and East Asia . HFC-23 is a by-product of HCFC-22 production. Direct measurements of HFC-23 in ambient air at five sites began in 2007. The 2005 global annual mean used to calculate the increase since AR4 in Table 2.1, 5.2 ppt, is based on an archive of air collected at Cape Grim, Tasmania . In 2011, atmospheric HFC-23 was at 24.0 ppt. Its growth rate peaked in 2006 as emissions from developing countries 600 500 CFC-12	0
increased, then declined as emissions were reduced through abatement efforts under the Clean Development Mechanism  of the UNFCCC. Estimates of total global emissions based on atmospheric observations and bottom-up inventories agree within uncertainties . Currently, the largest emissions of HFC-23 are from East Asia ; developed countries emit less than 20% of the global total. Keller et al.  found that emissions from developed countries may be larger than those reported to the UNFCCC, but their contribution is small. The lifetime of HFC-23 was revised from 270 to 222 years since AR4. After HFC-134a and HFC-23, the next most abundant HFCs are HFC143a at 12.04 ppt in 2011, 6.39 ppt greater than in 2005; HFC-125  at 9.58 ppt, increasing by 5.89 ppt since 2005; HFC-152a  at 6.4 ppt with a 3.0 ppt increase since 2005; and HFC-32 at 4.92 ppt in 2011, 3.77 ppt greater than in 2005. Since 2005, all of these were increasing exponentially except for HFC152a, whose growth rate slowed considerably in about 2007 . HFC-152a has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of 1.5 years, so its growth rate will respond quickly to changes in emissions. Its major uses are as a foam blowing agent and aerosol spray propellant while HFC-143a, HFC-125, and HFC-32 are mainly used in refrigerant blends. The reasons for slower growth in HFC-152a since about 2007 are unclear. Total global emissions of HFC-125 estimated from the observations are within about 20% of emissions reported to the UNFCCC, after accounting for estimates of unreported emissions from East Asia . CF4 and C2F6  have lifetimes of 50 kyr and 10 kyr, respectively, and they are emitted as by-products of aluminium production and used in plasma etching of electronics. CF4 has a natural lithospheric source  with a 1750 level determined from Greenland and Antarctic firn air of 34.7  0.2 ppt . In 2011, atmospheric abundances were 79.0 ppt for CF4, increasing by 4.0 ppt since 2005, and 4.16 ppt for C2F6, increasing by 0.50 ppt. The sum of emissions of CF4 reported by aluminium producers and for non-aluminium production in EDGAR  v4.0 accounts for only about half of global emissions inferred from atmospheric observations . For C2F6, emissions reported to the UNFCCC are also substantially lower than those estimated from atmospheric observations . The main sources of atmospheric SF6 emissions are electricity distribution systems, magnesium production, and semi-conductor manufacturing. Global annual mean SF6 in 2011 was 7.29 ppt, increasing by 1.65 ppt since 2005. SF6 has a lifetime of 3200 years, so its emissions accumulate in the atmosphere and can be estimated directly from its observed rate of increase. Levin et al.  and Rigby et al.  showed that SF6 emissions decreased after 1995, most likely because of emissions reductions in developed countries, but then increased after 1998. During the past decade, they found that actual SF6 emissions from developed countries are at least twice the reported values. NF3 was added to the list of GHG in the Kyoto Protocol with the Doha Amendment, December, 2012. Arnold et al.  determined 0.59 ppt	0
for its global annual mean mole fraction in 2008, growing from almost zero in 1978. In 2011, NF3 was 0.86 ppt, increasing by 0.49 ppt since 2005. These abundances were updated from the first work to quantify NF3 by Weiss et al. . Initial bottom-up inventories underestimated its emissions; based on the atmospheric observations, NF3 emissions were 1.18  0.21Gg in 2011 . In summary, it is certain that atmospheric burdens of well-mixed GHGs targeted by the Kyoto Protocol increased from 2005 to 2011. The atmospheric abundance of CO2 was 390.5  0.2 ppm in 2011; this is 40% greater than before 1750. Atmospheric N2O was 324.2  0.2 ppb in 2011 and has increased by 20% since 1750. Average annual increases in CO2 and N2O from 2005 to 2011 are comparable to those observed from 1996 to 2005. Atmospheric CH4 was 1803.2  2.0 ppb in 2011; this is 150% greater than before 1750. CH4 began increasing in 2007 after remaining nearly constant from 1999 to 2006. HFCs, PFCs, and SF6 all continue to increase relatively rapidly, but their contributions to RF are less than 1% of the total by well-mixed GHGs .	0
2.2.1.2 Ozone-Depleting Substances  CFC atmospheric abundances are decreasing  because of the successful reduction in emissions resulting from the Montreal Protocol. By 2010, emissions from ODSs had been reduced by ~11 Pg CO2-eq yr-1, which is five to six times the reduction target of the first commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol  . These avoided equivalent-CO2 emissions account for the offsets to RF by stratospheric O3 depletion caused by ODSs and the use of HFCs as substitutes for them. Recent observations in Arctic and Antarctic firn air further confirm that emissions of CFCs are entirely anthropogenic . CFC-12 has the largest atmospheric abundance and GWP-weighted emissions  of the CFCs. Its tropospheric abundance peaked during 2000-2004. Since AR4, its global annual mean mole fraction declined by 13.8 ppt to 528.5 ppt in 2011. CFC-11 continued the decrease that started in the mid-1990s, by 12.9 ppt since 2005. In 2011, CFC-11 was 237.7 ppt. CFC-113 decreased by 4.3 ppt since 2005 to 74.3 ppt in 2011. A discrepancy exists between top-down and bottom-up methods for calculating CFC-11 emissions . Emissions calculated using top-down methods come into agreement with bottom-up estimates when a lifetime of 64 years is used for CFC-11 in place of the accepted value of 45 years; this longer lifetime  is at the upper end of the range estimated by Douglass et al.  with models that more accurately simulate stratospheric circulation. Future emissions of CFCs will largely come from `banks'  rather than current production. The mean decrease in globally, annually averaged carbon tetrachloride  based on NOAA and AGAGE measurements since 2005 was 7.4 ppt, with an atmospheric abundance of 85.8 ppt in 2011 . The observed rate of decrease and inter-hemispheric difference of CCl4 suggest that emissions determined from the observations are on average greater and less variable than bottom-up emission estimates, although large uncertainties in the CCl4 lifetime result in large uncertainties in the top-down estimates of emissions (Xiao et al., 2010; 169	0
HCFCs are classified as `transitional substitutes' by the Montreal Protocol. Their global production and use will ultimately be phased out, but their global production is not currently capped and, based on changes in observed spatial gradients, there has likely been a shift in emissions within the NH from regions north of about 30N to regions south of 30N . Global levels of the three most abundant HCFCs in the atmosphere continue to increase. HCFC-22 increased by 44.5 ppt since 2005 to 213.3 ppt in 2011. Developed country emissions of HCFC-22 are decreasing, and the trend in total global emissions is driven by large increases from south and Southeast Asia . HCFC-141b increased by 3.7 ppt since 2005 to 21.4 ppt in 2011, and for HCFC-142b, the increase was 5.73 ppt to 21.1 ppt in 2011. The rates of increase in these three HCFCs increased since 2004, but the change in HCFC-141b growth rate was smaller and less persistent than for the other two, which approximately doubled from 2004 to 2007 . In summary, for ODS, whose production and consumption are controlled by the Montreal Protocol, it is certain that the global mean abundances of major CFCs are decreasing and HCFCs are increasing. Atmospheric burdens of CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CCl4, CH3CCl3 and some halons have decreased since 2005. HCFCs, which are transitional substitutes for CFCs, continue to increase, but the spatial distribution of their emissions is changing.	0
2.2.2.1 Stratospheric Water Vapour Stratospheric H2O vapour has an important role in the Earth's radiative balance and in stratospheric chemistry. Increased stratospheric H2O vapour causes the troposphere to warm and the stratosphere to cool , and also causes increased rates of stratospheric O3 loss . Water vapour enters the stratosphere through the cold tropical tropopause. As moisture-rich air masses are transported through this region, most water vapour condenses resulting in extremely dry lower stratospheric air. Because tropopause temperature varies seasonally, so does H2O abundance there. Other contributions include oxidation of methane within the stratosphere, and possibly direct injection of H2O vapour in overshooting deep convection . AR4 reported that stratospheric H2O vapour showed significant long-term variability and an upward trend over the last half of the 20th century, but no net increase since 1996. This updated assessment finds large interannual variations that have been observed by independent measurement techniques, but no significant net changes since 1996. 170	0
The longest continuous time series of stratospheric water vapour abundance is from in situ measurements made with frost point hygrometers starting in 1980 over Boulder, USA  , with values ranging from 3.5 to 5.5 ppm, depending on altitude. These observations have been complemented by long-term global satellite observations from SAGE II ), HALOE ), Aura MLS ) and Envisat MIPAS ). Discrepancies in water vapour mixing ratios from these different instruments can be attributed to differences in the vertical resolution of measurements, along with other factors. For example, offsets of up to 0.5 ppm in lower stratospheric water vapour mixing ratios exist between the most current versions of HALOE  and Aura MLS  retrievals during their 16-month period of overlap , although such biases can be removed to generate long-term records. Since AR4, new studies characterize the uncertainties in measurements from individual types of in situ H2O sensors , but discrepancies between different instruments , particularly for high-altitude measurements from aircraft, remain largely unexplained. Observed anomalies in stratospheric H2O from the near-global combined HALOE+MLS record   include effects linked to the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation  influence on tropopause temperatures, plus a step-like drop after 2001 , and an increasing trend since 2005. Variability during 2001-2011 was large yet there was only a small net change from 1992 through 2011. These interannual water vapour variations for the satellite record are closely linked to observed changes in tropical tropopause temperatures , providing reasonable understanding of observed changes. The longer record of Boulder balloon measurements  has been updated and reanalyzed , showing deca dal-scale variability and a long-term stratospheric  increase of 1.0  0.2 ppm for 1980-2010. Agreement between interannual changes inferred from the Boulder and HALOE+MLS data is good for the period since 1998 but was poor during 1992-1996. About 30% of the positive trend during 1980-2010 determined from frost point hygrometer data  can be explained by increased production of H2O from CH4 oxidation , but the remainder cannot be explained by changes in tropical tropopause temperatures  or other known factors. In summary, near-global satellite measurements of stratospheric H2O show substantial variability for 1992-2011, with a step-like decrease after 2000 and increases since 2005. Because of this large variability and relatively short time series, confidence in long-term stratospheric H2O trends is low. There is good understanding of the relationship between the satellite-derived H2O variations and tropical tropopause temperature changes. Stratospheric H2O changes from temporally sparse balloon-borne observations at one location  are in good agreement with satellite observations from 1998 to the present, but discrepancies exist for changes during 1992-1996.

2.2.2.2 Stratospheric Ozone AR4 did not explicitly discuss measured stratospheric ozone trends. For the current assessment report such trends are relevant because they are the basis for revising the RF from -0.05  0.10 W m-2 in 1750 to -0.10  0.15 W m-2 in 2005 . These values strongly depend on the vertical distribution of the stratospheric ozone changes. Total ozone is a good proxy for stratospheric ozone because tropospheric ozone accounts for only about 10% of the total ozone column. Long-term total ozone changes over various latitudinal belts, derived from Weber et al. , are illustrated in Figure 2.6 . Annually averaged total column ozone declined during the 1980s and early 1990s and has remained constant for the past decade, about 3.5 and 2.5% below the 1964-1980 average for the entire globe  and 60S to 60N, respectively, with changes occurring mostly outside the tropics, particularly the SH, where the current extratropical  mean values are 6% below the 1964-1980 average, compared to 3.5% for the NH extratropics . In the NH, the 1993 minimum of about -6% was caused primarily by ozone loss through heterogeneous reactions on volcanic aerosols from Mt. Pinatubo.	0
Two altitude regions are mainly responsible for long-term changes in total column ozone . In the upper stratosphere , there was a strong and statistically significant decline  up to the mid-1990s and little change or a slight increase since. The lower stratosphere, between 20 and 25 km over mid-latitudes, also experienced a statistically significant decline  between 1979 and the mid-1990s, followed by stabilization or a slight  ozone increase. Springtime averages of total ozone poleward of 60 latitude in the Arctic and Antarctic are shown in Figure 2.6e. By far the strongest ozone loss in the stratosphere occurs in austral spring over Antarctica  and its impact on SH climate is discussed in Chapters 11, 12 and 14. Interannual variability in polar stratospheric ozone abundance and chemistry is driven by variability in temperature and transport due to year-to-year differences in dynamics. This variability is particularly large in the Arctic, where the most recent large depletion occurred in 2011, when chemical ozone destruction was, for the first time in the observational record, comparable to that in the Antarctic . In summary, it is certain that global stratospheric ozone has declined from pre-1980 values. Most of the decline occurred prior to the mid1990s; since then there has been little net change and ozone has remained nearly constant at about 3.5% below the 1964-1980 level.	0
Tropospheric ozone is a short-lived trace gas that either originates in the stratosphere or is produced in situ by precursor gases and sunlight . An important GHG with an estimated RF of 0.40  0.20 W m-2 , tropospheric ozone also impacts human health and vegetation at the surface. Its average atmospheric lifetime of a few weeks produces a global distribution highly variable by season, altitude and location. These characteristics and the paucity of long-term measurements make the assessment of long-term global ozone trends challenging. However, new studies since AR4 provide greater understanding of surface and free tropospheric ozone trends from the 1950s through 2010. An extensive compilation of measured ozone trends is presented in the Supplementary Material, Figure 2.SM.1 and Table 2.SM.2.	1
The earliest  quantitative ozone observations are limited to Montsouris near Paris where ozone averaged 11 ppb . Semiquantitative ozone measurements from more than 40 locations around the world in the late 1800s and early 1900s range from 5 to 32 ppb with large uncertainty . The low 19th century ozone values cannot be reproduced by most models , and this discrepancy is an important factor contributing to uncertainty in RF calculations . Limited quantitative measurements from the 1870s to 1950s indicate that surface ozone in Europe increased by more than a factor of 2 compared to observations made at the end of the 20th century .	0
Long-term ozone trends at the surface and in the free troposphere  can be assessed only from in situ measurements at a limited number of sites, leaving large areas such as the tropics and SH sparsely sampled . Nineteen predominantly rural surface sites or regions around the globe have long-term records that stretch back to the 1970s, and in two cases the 1950s . Thirteen of these sites are in the NH, and 11 sites have statistically significant positive trends of 1 to 5 ppb per decade, corresponding to >100% ozone increases since the 1950s and 9 to 55% ozone increases since the 1970s. In the SH, three of six sites have significant trends of approximately 2 ppb per decade and three have insignificant trends. Free tropospheric monitoring since the 1970s is more limited. Significant positive trends since 1971 have been observed using ozone sondes above Western Europe, Japan and coastal Antarctica , but not at all levels . In addition, aircraft have measured	0
Owing to methodological changes, free tropospheric ozone observations are most reliable since the mid-1990s. Ozone has decreased above Europe since 1998  and is largely unchanged above Japan . Otherwise the remaining regions with measurements  show a range of positive trends  depending on altitude, with no site having a negative trend at any altitude . In summary, there is medium confidence from limited measurements in the late 19th through mid-20th century that European surface ozone more than doubled by the end of the 20th century. There is medium confidence from more widespread measurements beginning in the 1970s that surface ozone has increased at most  sites in the NH , while there is low confidence for ozone increases  in the SH. Since 1990 surface ozone has likely increased in East Asia, while surface ozone in the eastern USA and Western Europe has levelled off or is decreasing. Ozone monitoring in the free troposphere since the 1970s is very limited and indicates a weaker rate of increase than at the surface. Satellite instruments can now quantify the present-day tropospheric ozone burden on a near-global basis; significant tropospheric ozone column increases were observed over extended tropical regions of southern Asia, as well as mid-latitude regions of the South and North Pacific Ocean since 1979.	0
In recent decades ozone precursor emissions have decreased in Europe and North America and increased in Asia , impacting ozone production on regional and hemispheric scales . Accordingly, 1990-2010 surface ozone trends vary regionally. In Europe ozone generally increased through much of the 1990s but since 2000 ozone has either levelled off or decreased at rural and mountaintop sites, as well as for baseline ozone coming ashore at Mace Head, Ireland . In North America surface ozone has increased in eastern and Arctic Canada, but is unchanged in central and western Canada . Surface ozone has increased in baseline air masses coming ashore along the west coast of the USA  and at half of the rural sites in the western USA during spring . In the eastern USA surface ozone has decreased strongly in summer, is largely unchanged in spring and has increased in winter . East Asian surface ozone is generally increasing  and at downwind sites ozone is increasing at Mauna Loa, Hawaii but decreasing at Minami Tori Shima in the subtropical western North Pacific . In the SH ozone has increased at the eight available sites, although trends are insignificant at four sites .	0

Emissions of carbon monoxide , non-methane volatile organic compounds  and NOx  do not have a direct effect on RF, but affect climate indirectly as precursors to tropospheric O3 and aerosol formation, and their impacts on OH concentrations and CH4 lifetime. NMVOCs include aliphatic, aromatic and oxygenated hydrocarbons , and have atmospheric lifetimes ranging from hours to months. Global coverage of NMVOC measurements is poor, except for a few compounds. Reports on trends generally indicate declines in a range of NMVOCs in urban and rural regions of North America and Europe on the order of a few percent to more than 10% yr-1. Global ethane levels reported by Simpson et al.  declined by about 21% from 1986 to 2010. Measurements of air extracted from firn suggest that NMVOC concentrations were growing until 1980 and declined afterwards . Satellite retrievals of formaldehyde column abundances from 1997 to 2007 show significant positive trends over northeastern China  and India , possibly related to strong increases in anthropogenic NMVOC emissions, whereas negative trends of about -3% yr-1 are observed over Tokyo, Japan and the northeast USA urban corridor as a result of pollution regulation . The major sources of atmospheric CO are in situ production by oxidation of hydrocarbons  and direct emission resulting from incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels. An analysis of MOPITT  and AIRS  satellite data suggest a clear and consistent decline of CO columns for 2002-2010 over a number of polluted regions in Europe, North America and Asia with a global trend of about -1% yr-1 . Analysis of satellite data using two more instruments for recent overlapping years shows qualitatively similar decreasing trends , but the magnitude of trends remains uncertain owing to the presence of instrument biases. Small CO decreases observed in the NOAA and AGAGE networks are consistent with slight declines in global anthropogenic CO emissions over the same time . Due to its short atmospheric lifetime , NOx concentrations are highly variable in time and space. AR4 described the potential of satellite observations of NO2 to verify and improve NOx emission inventories and their trends and reported strong NO2 increases by 50% over the industrial areas of China from 1996 to 2004. An extension of this analysis reveals increases between a factor of 1.7 and 3.2 over parts of China, while over Europe and the USA NO2 has decreased by 30 to 50% between 1996 and 2010 .	0
NOx emissions, with Castellanos and Boersma  reporting overall increases in global emissions, driven by Asian emission increases of up to 29% yr-1 , while moderate decreases up to 7% yr-1  are reported for North America and Europe. In summary, satellite and surface observations of ozone precursor gases NOx, CO, and non-methane volatile organic carbons indicate strong regional differences in trends. Most notably, NO2 has likely decreased by 30 to 50% in Europe and North America and increased by more than a factor of 2 in Asia since the mid-1990s.	0
This section assesses trends in aerosol resulting from both anthropogenic and natural sources. The significance of aerosol changes for global dimming and brightening is discussed in Section 2.3. Chapter 7 provides additional discussion of aerosol properties, while Chapter 8 discusses future RF and the ice-core records that contain information on aerosol changes prior to the 1980s. Chapter 11 assesses air quality-climate change interactions. Because of the short lifetime  of tropospheric aerosol, trends have a strong regional signature. Aerosol from anthropogenic sources  are confined mainly to populated regions in the NH, whereas aerosol from natural sources, such as desert dust, sea salt, volcanoes and the biosphere, are important in both hemispheres and likely dependent on climate and land use change . Owing to interannual variability, long-term trends in aerosols from natural sources are more difficult to identify .	0
along with improved retrieval methods and methodological intercomparisons, allow assessment of regional AOD trends since about 1995. AOD sun photometer measurements at two stations in northern Germany, with limited regional representativity, suggest a long-term decline of AOD in Europe since 1986 . Groundbased, cloud-screened solar broadband radiometer measurements provide longer time-records than spectrally selective sun-photometer data, but are less specific for aerosol retrieval. Multi-decadal records over Japan  indicate an AOD increase until the mid1980s, followed by an AOD decrease until the late 1990s and almost constant AOD in the 2000s. Similar broad-band solar radiative flux multi-decadal trends have been observed for urban-industrial regions of Europe and North America , and were linked to successful measures to reduce sulphate  emissions since the mid-1980s . An indirect method to estimate AOD is offered by ground-based visibility observations. These data are more ambiguous to interpret, but records go further back in time than broadband, sun photometer and satellite data. A multi-regional analysis for 1973- 2007  shows that prior to the 1990s visibility-derived AOD was relatively constant in most regions analysed , but after 1990 positive AOD trends were observed over Asia, and parts of South America, Australia and Africa, and mostly negative AOD trends were found over Europe. In North America, a small stepwise decrease of visibility after 1993 was likely related to methodological changes . AOD can be determined most accurately with sun photometers that measure direct solar intensity in the absence of cloud interferences with an absolute uncertainty of single measurements of  0.01% . AERONET  is a global sun photometer network , with densest coverage over Europe and North America. AERONET AOD temporal trends were examined in independent studies , using different data selection and statistical methods. Hsu et al.  investigated AOD trends at 12 AERONET sites with data coverage of at least 10 years between 1997 and 2010. Yoon et al.  investigated AOD and size trends at 14 AERONET sites with data coverage varying between 4 and 12 years between 1997 and 2009. DeMeij et al.  investigated AOD trends between 2000 and 2009  at 62 AERONET sites mostly located in USA and Europe. Each of these studies noted an increase in AOD over East Asia and reductions in North America and Europe. The only dense sun photometer network over southern Asia, ARFINET , shows an increase in AOD of about 2% yr-1 during the last one to two decades , with an absolute uncertainty of  0.02 at 500 nm . In contrast, negative AOD trends are identified at more than 80% of examined European and North American AERONET sites . Decreasing AOD is also observed near the west coast of northern Africa, where aerosol loads are dominated by Saharan dust outflow. Positive AOD trends are found over the Arabian Peninsula, where aerosol is dominated by dust. Inconsistent AOD trends reported for stations in central Africa result from the use of relatively short time series with respect to the large interannual variability caused by wildfires and dust emissions.	0
Aerosol products from dedicated satellite sensors complement surface-based AOD with better spatial coverage. The quality of the satellite-derived AOD strongly depends on the retrieval's ability to remove scenes contaminated by clouds and to accurately account for reflectivity at the Earth's surface. Due to relatively weak reflectance of incoming sunlight by the sea surface, the typical accuracy of retrieved AOD over oceans ) is usually better than over continents ). Satellite-based AOD trends at 550 nm over oceans from conservatively cloud-screened MODIS data  for 2000-2009 are presented in Figure 2.9. Strongly positive AOD trends were observed over the oceans adjacent to southern and eastern Asia. Positive AOD trends are also observed over most tropical oceans. The negative MODIS AOD trends observed over coastal regions of Europe and near the east coast of the USA are in agreement with sun photometer observations and in situ measurements  of aerosol mass in these regions. These regional changes over oceans are consistent with analyses of AVHRR  trends for 1981-2005 , except over the Southern Ocean , where negative AOD trends of AVHRR retrievals are neither confirmed by MODIS after 2001  nor by ATSR-2  for 1995-2001 . Satellite-based AOD changes for both land and oceans  were examined with re-processed SeaWiFS  AOD data for 1998-2010 . A small positive global average AOD trend is reported, which is likely influenced by interannual natural aerosol emissions variability ; Box 2.5), and compensating larger positive and negative regional AOD trends. In addition, temporal changes in aerosol composition are ignored in the retrieval algorithms, giving more uncertain trends than suggested by statistical analysis alone . Thus, confidence is low for global satellite derived AOD trends over these relatively short time periods. The sign and magnitude of SeaWiFS regional AOD trends over continents are in agreement with most AOD trends by ground-based sun photometer data  and with MODIS trends . The strong positive AOD trend over the Arabian Peninsula occurs mainly during spring  and summer , during times of dust transport, and is also visible in MODIS data . The positive AOD trend over southern and eastern Asia is strongest during the dry seasons , when reduced wet deposition allows anthropogenic aerosol to accumulate in the troposphere. AOD over the Saharan outflow region off western Africa displays the strongest seasonal AOD trend differences, with AOD increases only in spring, but strong AOD decreases during the other seasons. SeaWifs AOD decreases over Europe and the USA and increases over southern and eastern Asia  are in agreement with reported temporal trends in anthropogenic emissions, and surface observations . In summary, based on satellite- and surface-based remote sensing it is very likely that AOD has decreased over Europe and the eastern 175	0

An overview of current networks and definitions pertinent to aerosol measurements is given in Supplementary Material 2.SM.2.3. Studies reporting trends representative of regional changes are presented in Table 2.2. Long-term data are almost entirely from North America and Europe, whereas a few individual studies on aerosol trends in India and China are reported in Supplementary Material 2.SM.2.3. Figure 2.10 gives an overview of observed PM10, PM2.5, and sulphate trends in North America and Europe for 1990-2009 and 2000-2009.	0
In Europe, strong downward trends are observed for PM10, PM2.5 and sulphate from the rural stations in the EMEP  network. For 2000-2009, PM2.5 shows an average reduction of 3.9% yr-1 for the six stations with significant trends, while trends are not significant at seven other stations. Over 2000-2009, PM10 at 12  sites shows significant downward trend of on average 2.6% yr-1. Similarly sulphate strongly decreased at 3.1% yr-1 from 1990 to 2009 with 26 of 30 sites having significant reductions. The largest decrease occurred before 2000, while for 2000-2009, the trends were weaker and less robust. This is consistent with reported emission reductions of 65% from 1990 to 2000 and 28% from 2001 to 2009 . Model analysis  attributed the trends in large part to emission changes. In the USA, the largest reductions in PM and sulphate are observed in the 2000s, rather than the 1990s as in Europe. IMPROVE  PM2.5 measurements  show significant downward trends averaging 4.0% yr-1 for 2000-2009 at sites with significant trends,	0
and 2.1% yr-1 at all sites, and PM10 decreases of 3.1% yr-1 for 2000- 2009. Declines of PM2.5 and SO42- in Canada are very similar , with annual mean PM2.5 at urban measurement sites decreasing by 3.6% yr-1 during 1985-2006 . In the eastern and southwestern USA, IMPROVE data show strong sulphate declines, which range from 2 to 6% yr-1, with an average of 2.3% yr-1 for the sites with significant negative trends for 1990-2009. However, four IMPROVE sites show strong SO42- increases from 2000 to 2009, amounting to 11.9% yr-1, at Hawaii , and 4 to 7% yr-1 at three sites in southwest Alaska. A recent study on long-term trends in aerosol optical properties from 24 globally distributed background sites  reported statistically significant trends at 16 locations, but the sign and magnitude of the trends varied largely with the aerosol property considered and geographical region . Among the sites, this study reported strong increases in absorption and scattering coefficients in the free troposphere at Mauna Loa, Hawaii , which is a regional feature also evident in the satellite-based AOD 177	0
trends . Possible explanations for these changes include the influence of increasing Asian emissions and changes in clouds and removal processes. More and longer Asian time series, coupled with transport analyses, are needed to corroborate these findings. Aerosol number concentrations  are declining significantly at most sites in Europe, North America, the Pacific and the Caribbean, but increasing at South Pole based on a study of 17 globally distributed remote sites. Total carbon  measurements indicate highly significant downward trends between 2.5 and 7.5% yr-1 along the east and west coasts of the USA, and smaller and less significant trends in other regions of the USA from 1989 to 2008 . In Europe, Torseth et al.  suggest a slight reduction in elemental carbon concentrations at two stations from 2001 to 2009, subject to 178	0
large interannual variability. Collaud Coen et al.  reported consistent negative trends in the aerosol absorption coefficient at stations in the continental USA, Arctic and Antarctica, but mostly insignificant trends in Europe over the last decade. In the Arctic, changes in aerosol impact the atmosphere's radiative balance as well as snow and ice albedo. Similar to Europe and the USA, Hirdman et al.  reported downward trends in equivalent black carbon and SO42- for two out of total three Arctic stations and attributed them to emission changes. In summary, declining AOD in Europe and North America is corroborated by very likely downward trends in ground-based in situ particulate matter measurements since the mid-1980s. Robust evidence from around 200 regional background sites with in situ ground based aerosol measurements indicate downward trends in the last two decades of PM2.5 in parts of Europe  and the USA ,	0
Box 2.2 | Quantifying Changes in the Mean: Trend Models and Estimation Many statistical methods exist for estimating trends in environmental time series . The assessment of long-term changes in historical climate data requires trend models that are transparent and robust, and that can provide credible uncertainty estimates. Linear Trends Historical climate trends are frequently described and quantified by estimating the linear component of the change over time . Such linear trend modelling has broad acceptance and understanding based on its frequent and widespread use in the published research assessed in this report, and its strengths and weaknesses are well known . Challenges exist in assessing the uncertainty in the trend and its dependence on the assumptions about the sampling distribution , uncertainty in the data, dependency models for the residuals about the trend line, and treating their serial correlation . The quantification and visualization of temporal changes are assessed in this chapter using a linear trend model that allows for firstorder autocorrelation in the residuals . Trend slopes in such a model are the same as ordinary least squares trends; uncertainties are computed using an approximate method. The 90% confidence interval quoted is solely that arising from sampling uncertainty in estimating the trend. Structural uncertainties, to the extent sampled, are apparent from the range of estimates from different data sets. Parametric and other remaining uncertainties , for which estimates are provided with some data sets, are not included in the trend estimates shown here, so that the same method can be applied to all data sets considered. Nonlinear Trends There is no a priori physical reason why the long-term trend in climate variables should be linear in time. Climatic time series often have trends for which a straight line is not a good approximation . The residuals from a linear fit in time often do not follow a simple autoregressive or moving average process, and linear trend estimates can easily change when recalculated 	0
Box 2.2, Table 1 shows estimates of the change in the GMST from the two methods. The methods give similar estimates with 90% confidence intervals that overlap one another. Smoothing methods that do not assume the trend is linear can provide useful information on the structure of change that is not as well treated with linear fits. The linear trend fit is used in this chapter because it can be applied consistently to all the data sets, is relatively simple, transparent and easily comprehended, and is frequently used in the published research assessed here.	0
heating. Spatial and temporal energy imbalances due to radiation and latent heating produce the general circulation of the atmosphere and oceans. Anthropogenic influence on climate occurs primarily through perturbations of the components of the Earth radiation budget. The radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere  includes the absorption of solar radiation by the Earth, determined as the difference between the incident and reflected solar radiation at the TOA, as well as the thermal outgoing radiation emitted to space. The surface radiation budget takes into account the solar fluxes absorbed at the Earth's surface, as well as the upward and downward thermal radiative fluxes emitted by the surface and atmosphere, respectively. In view of new	0
Since AR4, knowledge on the magnitude of the radiative energy fluxes in the climate system has improved, requiring an update of the global annual mean energy balance diagram . Energy exchanges between Sun, Earth and Space are observed from space-borne platforms such as the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System  and the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment  which began data collection in 2000 and 2003, respectively. The total solar irradiance  incident at the TOA is now much better known, with the SORCE Total Irradiance Monitor  instrument reporting uncertainties as low as 0.035%, compared to 0.1% for other TSI instruments . During the 2008 solar minimum, SORCE/TIM observed a solar irradiance of 1360.8  0.5 W m-2 compared to 1365.5  1.3 W m-2 for instruments launched prior to SORCE and still operating in 2008 . Kopp and Lean  conclude that the SORCE/TIM value of TSI is the most credible value because it is validated by a National Institute of Standards and Technology calibrated cryogenic radiometer. This revised TSI estimate corresponds to a solar irradiance close to 340 W m-2 globally averaged over the Earth's sphere .	0
The estimate for the reflected solar radiation at the TOA in Figure 2.11, 100 W m-2, is a rounded value based on the CERES Energy Balanced and Filled  satellite data product  for the period 2001-2010. This data set adjusts the solar and thermal TOA fluxes within their range of uncertainty to be consistent with independent estimates of the global heating rate based on in situ ocean observations . This leaves 240 W m-2 of solar radiation absorbed by the Earth, which is nearly balanced by thermal emission to space of about 239 W m-2 , considering a global heat storage of 0.6 W m-2  based on Argo data from 2005 to 2010 . The stated uncertainty in the solar reflected TOA fluxes from CERES due to uncertainty in absolute calibration alone is about 2% , or equivalently 2 W m-2 . The uncertainty of the outgoing thermal flux at the TOA as measured by CERES due to calibration is ~3.7 W m-2 . In addition to this, there is uncertainty in removing the influence of instrument spectral response on measured radiance, in radiance-to-flux conversion, and in time- space averaging, which adds up to another 1 W m-2 . The components of the radiation budget at the surface are generally more uncertain than their counterparts at the TOA because they cannot be directly measured by passive satellite sensors and surface measurements are not always regionally or globally representative. Since AR4, new estimates for the downward thermal infrared  radiation at	0
the surface have been established that incorporate critical information on cloud base heights from space-borne radar and lidar instruments . In line with studies based on direct surface radiation measurements  these studies propose higher values of global mean downward thermal radiation than presented in previous IPCC assessments and typically found in climate models, exceeding 340 W m-2 . This aligns with the downward thermal radiation in the ERA-Interim and ERA-40 reanalyses , of 341 and 344 W m-2, respectively . Estimates of global mean downward thermal radiation computed as a residual of the other terms of the surface energy budget  are lower , highlighting remaining uncertainties in estimates of both radiative and non-radiative components of the surface energy budget. Estimates of absorbed solar radiation at the Earth's surface include considerable uncertainty. Published global mean values inferred from satellite retrievals, reanalyses and climate models range from below 160 W m-2 to above 170 W m-2. Recent studies taking into account surface observations as well as updated spectroscopic parameters and continuum absorption for water vapor favour values towards the lower bound of this range, near 160 W m-2, and an atmospheric solar absorption around 80 W m-2  . The ERA-Interim and ERA-40 reanalyses further support an atmospheric solar absorption of this magnitude . Latest satellite-derived estimates constrained by CERES now also come close to these values . Recent independently derived surface radiation estimates favour therefore a global mean surface absorbed solar flux near 160 W m-2 and a downward thermal flux slightly above 340 W m-2, respectively . The global mean latent heat flux is required to exceed 80 W m-2 to close the surface energy balance in Figure 2.11, and comes close to the 85 W m-2 considered as upper limit by Trenberth and Fasullo  in view of current uncertainties in precipitation retrieval in the Global Precipitation Climatology Project  . This upper limit has recently been challenged by Stephens et al. . The emerging debate reflects potential remaining deficiencies in the quantification of the radiative and non-radiative energy balance components and associated uncertainty ranges, as well as in the consistent representation of the global mean energy and water budgets . Relative uncertainty in the globally averaged sensible heat flux estimate remains high owing to the very limited direct observational constraints . In summary, newly available observations from both space-borne and surface-based platforms allow a better quantification of the Global Energy Budget, even though notable uncertainties remain, particularly in the estimation of the non-radiative surface energy balance components. 182	0
While the previous section emphasized the temporally-averaged state of the radiation budget, the focus in the following is on the temporal  changes of its components. Variations in TSI are discussed in Section 8.4.1. AR4 reported large changes in tropical TOA radiation between the 1980s and 1990s based on observations from the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite  . Although the robust nature of the large decadal changes in tropical radiation remains to be established, several studies have suggested links to changes in atmospheric circulation  . Since AR4, CERES enabled the extension of satellite records of TOA fluxes into the 2000s . The extended records from CERES suggest no noticeable trends in either the tropical or global radiation budget during the first decade of the 21st century . Comparisons between ERBS/CERES thermal radiation and that derived from the NOAA High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder   show good agreement until approximately 1998, corroborating the rise of 0.7 W m-2 between the 1980s and 1990s reported in AR4. Thereafter the HIRS thermal fluxes show much higher values, likely due to changes in the channels used for HIRS/3 instruments launched after October 1998 compared to earlier HIRS instruments . On a global scale, interannual variations in net TOA radiation and ocean heating rate  should correspond, as oceans have a much larger effective heat capacity than land and atmosphere, and therefore serve as the main reservoir for heat added to the Earth-atmosphere system . Wong et al.  showed that interannual variations in these two data sources are in good agreement for 1992-2003. In the ensuing 5 years, however, Trenberth and Fasullo  note that the two diverge with ocean in situ measurements , indicating a decline in OHR, in contrast to expectations from the observed net TOA radiation. The divergence after 2004 is referred to as ``missing energy'' by Trenberth and Fasullo , who further argue that the main sink of the missing energy likely occurs at ocean depths below 275 m. Loeb et al.  compared interannual variations in CERES net radiation with OHRs derived from three independent ocean heat content anomaly analyses and included an error analysis of both CERES and the OHRs. They conclude that the apparent decline in OHR is not statistically robust and that differences between interannual variations in OHR and satellite net TOA flux are within the uncertainty of the measurements . They further note that between January 2001 and December 2012, the Earth has been steadily accumulating energy at a rate of 0.50  0.43 W m-2 . Hansen et al.  obtained a similar value for 2005-2010 using an independent analysis of the ocean heat content anomaly data . The variability in the Earth's energy imbalance is strongly influenced by ocean circulation changes relating to the ENSO ; during cooler La Nina years  less thermal radiation is emitted and the climate system gains heat while the reverse is true for warmer El Nino years  .	0
2.3.3.1 Surface Solar Radiation Changes in radiative fluxes at the surface can be traced further back in time than the satellite-based TOA fluxes, although only at selected terrestrial locations where long-term records exist. Monitoring of radiative fluxes from land-based stations began on a widespread basis in the mid-20th century, predominantly measuring the downward solar component, also known as global radiation or surface solar radiation . AR4 reported on the first indications for substantial decadal changes in observational records of SSR. Specifically, a decline of SSR from the beginning of widespread measurements in the 1950s until the mid1980s has been observed at many land-based sites , as well as a partial recovery from the 1980s onward  .	0
Since AR4, numerous studies have substantiated the findings of significant decadal SSR changes observed both at worldwide distributed terrestrial sites  as well as in specific regions. In Europe, Norris and Wild  noted a dimming between 1971 and 1986 of 2.0 to 3.1 W m-2 per decade and subsequent brightening of 1.1 to 1.4 W m-2 per decade from 1987 to 2002 in a pan-European time series comprising 75 sites. Similar tendencies were found at sites in northern Europe , Estonia  and Moscow . Chiacchio and Wild  pointed out that dimming and subsequent brightening in Europe is seen mainly in spring and summer. Brightening in Europe from the 1980s onward was further documented at sites in Switzerland, Germany, France, the Benelux, Greece, Eastern Europe and the Iberian Peninsula . Concurrent brightening of 2 to 8 W m-2 per decade was also noted at continental sites in the USA . The general pattern of dimming and consecutive brightening was further found at numerous sites in Japan  and in the SH in New Zealand . Analyses of observations from sites in China confirmed strong declines in SSR from the 1960s to 1980s on the order of 2 to 8 W m-2 per decade, which also did not persist in the 1990s . On the other hand, persistent dimming since the mid-20th	0

The longest observational SSR records, extending back to the 1920s and 1930s at a few sites in Europe, further indicate some brightening during the first half of the 20th century, known as `early brightening'  . This suggests that the decline in SSR, at least in Europe, was confined to a period between the 1950s and 1980s. A number of issues remain, such as the quality and representativeness of some of the SSR data as well as the large-scale significance of the phenomenon . The historic radiation records are of variable quality and rigorous quality control is necessary to avoid spurious trends . Since the mid-1990s, high-quality data are becoming increasingly available from new sites of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network  and Atmospheric Radiation Measurement  Program, which allow the determination of SSR variations with unprecedented accuracy . Alpert et al.  and Alpert and Kishcha  argued that the observed SSR decline between 1960 and 1990 was larger in densely populated than in rural areas. The magnitude of this `urbanization effect' in the radiation data is not yet well quantified. Dimming and brightening is, however, also notable at remote and rural sites . Globally complete satellite estimates have been available since the early 1980s . Because satellites do not directly measure the surface fluxes, they have to be inferred from measurable TOA signals using empirical or physical models to remove atmospheric perturbations. Available satellite-derived products qualitatively agree on a brightening from the mid-1980s to 2000 averaged globally as well as over oceans, on the order of 2 to 3 W m-2 per decade . Averaged over land, however, trends are positive or negative depending on the respective satellite product . Knowledge of the decadal variation of aerosol burdens and optical properties, required in satellite retrievals of SSR and considered relevant for dimming/brightening particularly over land, is very limited . Extensions of satellite-derived SSR beyond 2000 indicate tendencies towards a renewed dimming at the beginning of the new millennium . Reconstructions of SSR changes from more widely measured meteorological variables can help to increase their spatial and temporal coverage. Multi-decadal SSR changes have been related to observed changes in sunshine duration, atmospheric visibility, diurnal temperature range  and pan evaporation . 184	0
Overall, these proxies provide independent evidence for the existence of large-scale multi-decadal variations in SSR. Specifically, widespread observations of declines in pan evaporation from the 1950s to the 1980s were related to SSR dimming amongst other factors . The observed decline in DTR over global land surfaces from the 1950s to the 1980s , and its stabilisation thereafter fits to a large-scale dimming and subsequent brightening, respectively . Widespread brightening after 1980 is further supported by reconstructions from sunshine duration records . Over Europe, SSR dimming and subsequent brightening is consistent with concurrent declines and increases in sunshine duration , evaporation in energy limited environments , visibility records  and DTR . The early brightening in the 1930s and 1940s seen in a few European SSR records is in line with corresponding changes in sunshine duration and DTR . In China, the levelling off in SSR in the 1990s after decades of decline coincides with similar tendencies in the pan evaporation records, sunshine duration and DTR . Dimming up to the 1980s and subsequent brightening is also indicated in a set of 237 sunshine duration records in South America .	0
2.3.3.2 Surface Thermal and Net Radiation Thermal radiation, also known as longwave, terrestrial or far-IR radiation is sensitive to changes in atmospheric GHGs, temperature and humidity. Long-term measurements of the thermal surface components as well as surface net radiation are available at far fewer sites than SSR. Downward thermal radiation observations started to become available during the early 1990s at a limited number of globally distributed terrestrial sites. From these records, Wild et al.  determined an overall increase of 2.6 W m-2 per decade over the 1990s, in line with model projections and the expectations of an increasing greenhouse effect. Wang and Liang  inferred an increase in downward thermal radiation of 2.2 W m-2 per decade over the period 1973-2008 from globally available terrestrial observations of temperature, humidity and cloud fraction. Prata  estimated a slightly lower increase of 1.7 W m-2 per decade for clear sky conditions over the earlier period 1964-1990, based on observed temperature and	0
humidity profiles from globally distributed land-based radiosonde stations and radiative transfer calculations. Philipona et al.  and Wacker et al.  noted increasing downward thermal fluxes recorded in the Swiss Alpine Surface Radiation Budget  network since the mid-1990s, corroborating an increasing greenhouse effect. For mainland Europe, Philipona et al.  estimated an increase of downward thermal radiation of 2.4 to 2.7 W m-2 per decade for the period 1981-2005. There is limited observational information on changes in surface net radiation, in large part because measurements of upward fluxes at the surface are made at only a few sites and are not spatially representative. Wild et al.  inferred a decline in land surface net radiation on the order of 2 W m-2 per decade from the 1960s to the 1980s, and an increase at a similar rate from the 1980s to 2000, based on estimated changes of the individual radiative components that constitute the surface net radiation. Philipona et al.  estimated an increase in surface net radiation of 1.3 to 2 W m-2 per decade for central Europe and the Alps between 1981 and 2005.	0
2.3.3.3 Implications from Observed Changes in Related Climate Elements The observed multi-decadal SSR variations cannot be explained by changes in TSI, which are an order of magnitude smaller . They therefore have to originate from alterations in the transparency of the atmosphere, which depends on the presence of clouds, aerosols and radiatively active gases . Cloud cover changes  effectively modulate SSR on an interannual basis, but their contribution to the longer-term SSR trends is ambiguous. Although cloud cover changes were found to explain the trends in some areas , this is not always the case, particularly in relatively polluted regions . SSR dimming and brightening has also been observed under cloudless atmospheres at various locations, pointing to a prominent role of atmospheric aerosols .	0
Box 2.3 | Global Atmospheric Reanalyses Dynamical reanalyses are increasingly used for assessing weather and climate phenomena. Given their more frequent use in this assessment compared to AR4, their characteristics are described in more detail here. Reanalyses are distinct from, but complement, more `traditional' statistical approaches to assessing the raw observations. They aim to produce continuous reconstructions of past atmospheric states that are consistent with all observations as well as with atmospheric physics as represented in a numerical weather prediction model, a process termed data assimilation. Unlike real-world observations, reanalyses are uniform in space and time and provide non-observable variables . Several groups are actively pursuing reanalysis development at the global scale, and many of these have produced several generations of reanalyses products . Since the first generation of reanalyses produced in the 1990s, substantial development has taken place. The NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications  and ERA-Interim reanalyses show improved tropical precipitation and hence better represent the global hydrological cycle . The NCEP/CFSR reanalysis  Box 2.3, Table 1 | Overview of global dynamical reanalysis data sets . A further description of reanalyses and their technical derivation is given in pp. S33-35 of Blunden et al. . Approximate resolution is calculated as 1000 km * 20/N .	0
uses a coupled ocean-atmosphere-land-sea-ice model . The 20th Century Reanalyses  is a 56-member ensemble and covers 140 years by assimilating only surface and sea level pressure  information. This variety of groups and approaches provides some indication of the robustness of reanalyses when compared. In addition to the global reanalyses, several regional reanalyses exist or are currently being produced. Reanalyses products provide invaluable information on time scales ranging from daily to interannual variability. However, they may often be unable to characterize long-term trends . Although reanalyses projects by definition use a `frozen' assimilation system, there are many other sources of potential errors. In addition to model biases, changes in the observational systems  and time-dependent errors in the underlying observations or in the boundary conditions lead to step changes in time, even in latest generation reanalyses . Errors of this sort were ubiquitous in early generation reanalyses and rendered them of limited value for trend characterization . Subsequent products have improved and uncertainties are better understood , but artefacts are still present. As a consequence, trend adequacy depends on the variable under consideration, the time period and the region of interest. For example, surface air temperature and humidity trends over land in the ERA-Interim reanalysis compare well with observations , but polar tropospheric temperature trends in ERA-40 disagree with trends derived from radiosonde and satellite observations  owing to problems that were resolved in ERA-Interim .	0
Aerosols can directly attenuate SSR by scattering and absorbing solar radiation, or indirectly, through their ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei, thereby changing cloud reflectivity and lifetime . SSR dimming and brightening is often reconcilable with trends in anthropogenic emission histories and atmospheric aerosol loadings . Recent trends in aerosol optical depth derived from satellites indicate a decline in Europe since 2000 , in line with evidence from SSR observations. However, direct aerosol effects alone may not be able to account for the full extent of the observed SSR changes in remote regions with low pollution levels . Aerosol indirect effects have not yet been well quantified, but have the potential to amplify aerosol-induced SSR trends, particularly in relatively pristine environments, such as over oceans . SSR trends are also qualitatively in line with observed multi-decadal surface warming trends , with generally smaller warming rates during phases of declining SSR, and larger warming rates in phases of increasing SSR . This is seen more pronounced for the relatively polluted NH than the more pristine SH . For Europe, Vautard et al.  found that a decline in the frequency of low-visibility conditions such as fog, mist and haze over the past 30 years and associated SSR increase may be responsible for 10 to 20% of Europe's recent daytime warming, and 50% of Eastern European warming. Philipona  noted that both warming and brightening are weaker in the European Alps compared to the surrounding lowlands with stronger aerosol declines since 1981. 186	0
Reanalyses and observationally based methods have been used to show that increased atmospheric moisture with warming  enhances thermal radiative emission of the atmosphere to the surface, leading to reduced net thermal cooling of the surface . In summary, the evidence for widespread multi-decadal variations in solar radiation incident on land surfaces has been substantiated since AR4, with many of the observational records showing a decline from the 1950s to the 1980s , and a partial recovery thereafter . Confidence in these changes is high in regions with high station densities such as over Europe and parts of Asia. These likely changes are generally supported by observed changes in related, but more widely measured variables, such as sunshine duration, DTR and hydrological quantities, and are often in line with aerosol emission patterns. Over some remote land areas and over the oceans, confidence is low owing to the lack of direct observations, which hamper a truly global assessment. Satellite-derived SSR fluxes support the existence of brightening also over oceans, but are less consistent over land surface where direct aerosol effects become more important. There are also indications for increasing downward thermal and net radiation at terrestrial stations since the early 1990s with medium confidence.	0
2.4.1.1 Large-Scale Records and Their Uncertainties AR4 concluded global land-surface air temperature  had increased over the instrumental period of record, with the warming rate approximately double that reported over the oceans since 1979. Since AR4, substantial developments have occurred including the production of revised data sets, more digital data records, and new data set efforts. These innovations have improved understanding of data issues and uncertainties, allowing better quantification of regional changes. This reinforces confidence in the reported globally averaged LSAT time series behaviour. Global Historical Climatology Network Version 3  incorporates many improvements  but was found to be virtually indistinguishable at the global mean from version 2 . Goddard Institute of Space Studies  continues to provide an estimate based upon primarily GHCN, accounting for urban impacts through nightlights adjustments . CRUTEM4  incorporates additional station series and also newly homogenized versions of many individual station records. A new data product from a group based predominantly at Berkeley  uses a method that is substantially distinct from earlier efforts . Despite the range of approaches, the long-term variations and trends broadly agree among these various LSAT estimates, particularly after 1900. Global LSAT has increased . Since AR4, various theoretical challenges have been raised over the verity of global LSAT records . Globally, sampling and methodological independence has been assessed through sub-sampling , creation of an entirely new and structurally distinct product  and a complete reprocessing of GHCN . None of these yielded more than minor perturbations to the global LSAT records since 1900. Willett et al.  and Peterson et al.  explicitly showed that changes in specific and relative humidity  were physically consistent with reported temperature trends, a result replicated in the ERA reanalyses . Various investigators  showed that LSAT estimates from modern reanalyses were in quantitative agreement with observed products.	0
Particular controversy since AR4 has surrounded the LSAT record over the United States, focussed on siting quality of stations in the US Historical Climatology Network  and implications for long-term trends. Most sites exhibit poor current siting as assessed against official WMO siting guidance, and may be expected to suffer potentially large siting-induced absolute biases . However, overall biases for the network since the 1980s are likely dominated by instrument type  in the 1980s at the majority of sites), rather than siting biases . A new automated homogeneity assessment approach  was developed that has been shown to perform as well or better than other contemporary approaches . This homogenization procedure likely removes much of the bias related to the network-wide changes in the 1980s . Williams et al.  produced an ensemble of data set realizations using perturbed settings of this procedure and concluded through assessment against plausible test cases that there existed a propensity to under-estimate adjustments. This propensity is critically dependent upon the  nature of the inhomogeneities in the raw data records. Their homogenization increases both minimum temperature and maximum temperature centennial-time-scale USA average LSAT trends. Since 1979 these adjusted data agree with a range of reanalysis products whereas the raw records do not . Regional analyses of LSAT have not been limited to the United States. Various national and regional studies have undertaken assessments for Europe (Winkler, 2009; Bohm et al., 2010; Tietavainen et al., 2010; van	0
der Schrier et al., 2011), China , India , Australia , Canada , South America,  and East Africa . These analyses have used a range of methodologies and, in many cases, more data and metadata than available to the global analyses. Despite the range of analysis techniques they are generally in broad agreement with the global products in characterizing the long-term changes in mean temperatures. This includes some regions, such as the Pacific coast of South America, that have exhibited recent cooling . Of specific importance for the early global records, large  summer time warm bias adjustments for many European 19th century and early 20th century records were revisited and broadly confirmed by a range of approaches . Since AR4 efforts have also been made to interpolate Antarctic records from the sparse, predominantly coastal ground-based network . Although these agree that Antarctica as a whole has warmed since the late 1950s, substantial multi-annual to multi-decadal variability and uncertainties in reconstructed magnitude and spatial trend structure yield only low confidence in the details of pan-Antarctic regional LSAT changes. In summary, it is certain that globally averaged LSAT has risen since the late 19th century and that this warming has been particularly marked since the 1970s. Several independently analyzed global and regional LSAT data products support this conclusion. There is low confidence in changes prior to 1880 owing to the reduced number of estimates, non-standardized measurement techniques, the greater spread among the estimates and particularly the greatly reduced observational sampling. Confidence is also low in the spatial detail and magnitude of LSAT trends in sparsely sampled regions such as Antarctica. Since AR4 significant efforts have been undertaken to identify and adjust for data issues and new estimates have been produced. These innovations have further strengthened overall understanding of the global LSAT records.	0
2.4.1.2 Diurnal Temperature Range In AR4 diurnal temperature range  was found, globally, to have narrowed since 1950, with minimum daily temperatures increasing faster than maximum daily temperatures. However, significant multi-decadal variability was highlighted including a recent period from 1997 to 2004 of no change, as both maximum and minimum temperatures rose at similar rates. The Technical Summary of AR4 highlighted changes in DTR and their causes as a key uncertainty. Since AR4, uncertainties in DTR and its physical interpretation have become even more apparent. No dedicated global analysis of DTR has been undertaken subsequent to Vose et al. , although global behaviour has been discussed in two broader ranging analyses. Rohde et al.  and Wild et al.  note an apparent reversal since the mid-1980s; with DTR subsequently increasing. This decline and subsequent increase in DTR over global land surfaces is qualitatively consistent with the dimming and subsequent brightening noted in Section 2.3.3.1. Donat et al.  188	0
using HadEX2  find significant decreasing DTR trends in more than half of the land areas assessed but less than 10% of land with significant increases since 1951. Available trend estimates  and -0.066C per decade over 1950-2004 ) are much smaller than global mean LSAT average temperature trends over 1951-2012 . It therefore logically follows that globally averaged maximum and minimum temperatures over land have both increased by in excess of 0.1C per decade since 1950. Regionally, Makowski et al.  found that DTR behaviour in Europe over 1950 to 2005 changed from a decrease to an increase in the 1970s in Western Europe and in the 1980s in Eastern Europe. Sen Roy and Balling  found significant increases in both maximum and minimum temperatures for India, but little change in DTR over 1931- 2002. Christy et al.  reported that for East Africa there has been no pause in the narrowing of DTR in recent decades. Zhou and Ren  reported a significant decrease in DTR over mainland China of -0.15C per decade during 1961-2008. Various investigators , Pielke and Matsui , Zhou and Ren ) have raised doubts about the physical interpretation of minimum temperature trends, hypothesizing that microclimate and local atmospheric composition impacts are more apparent because the dynamical mixing at night is much reduced. Parker  investigated this issue arguing that if data were affected in this way, then a trend difference would be expected between calm and windy nights. However, he found no such minimum temperature differences on a global average basis. Using more complex boundary layer modelling techniques, Steeneveld et al.  and McNider et al.  showed much lower sensitivity to windspeed variations than posited by Pielke and Matsui but both concluded that boundary layer understanding was key to understanding the minimum temperature changes. Data analysis and long-term side-by-side instrumentation field studies show that real non-climatic data artefacts certainly affect maximum and minimum differently in the raw records for both recent  and older  records. Hence there could be issues over interpretation of apparent DTR trends and variability in many regions , particularly when accompanied by regional-scale land-use/ land-cover  changes . In summary, confidence is medium in reported decreases in observed global DTR, noted as a key uncertainty in AR4. Several recent analyses of the raw data on which many previous analyses were based point to the potential for biases that differently affect maximum and minimum average temperatures. However, apparent changes in DTR are much smaller than reported changes in average temperatures and therefore it is virtually certain that maximum and minimum temperatures have increased since 1950.	0
modified surface affects the storage and transfer of heat, water and airflow. For single discrete locations these impacts may dominate all other factors. Regionally, most attention has focused on China. A variety of investigations have used methods as diverse as SST comparisons , urban minus rural , satellite observations  and observations minus reanalysis . Interpretation is complicated because often studies have used distinct versions of station series. For example, the effect in Beijing is estimated at 80%  or 40%  of the observed trend depending on data corrections applied. A representative sample of these studies suggest the effect of UHI and LULC is approximately 20% of the trend in Eastern China as a whole and of the order 0.1C per decade nationally  over the last 30 years, but with very substantial uncertainties. These effects have likely been partially or completely accounted for in many homogenized series . Fujibe  ascribes about 25% of Japanese warming trends in 1979-2006 to UHI effects. Das et al.  confirmed that many Japanese sites have experienced UHI warming but that rural stations show unaffected behaviour when compared to nearby SSTs. There is an important distinction to be made between UHI trend effects in regions underseeing rapid development and those that have been developed for a long time. Jones and Lister  and Wilby et al.  using data from London  concluded that some sites that have always been urban and where the UHI has not grown in magnitude will exhibit regionally indicative trends that agree with nearby rural locations and that in such cases the time series may exhibit multi-decadal trends driven primarily by synoptic variations. A lack of obvious time-varying UHI influences was also noted for Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart in Australia by Trewin . The impacts of urbanization also will be dependent on the natural LULC characteristics that they replace. Zhang et al.  found no evidence for urban influences in the desert North West region of China despite rapid urbanization. Global adjusted data sets likely account for much of the UHI effect present in the raw data. For the US network, Hausfather et al.  showed that the adjustments method used in GHCNv3 removed much of an apparent systematic difference between urban and rural locations, concluding that this arose from adjustment of biased urban location data. Globally, Hansen et al.  used satellite-based nightlight radiances to estimate the worldwide influence on LSAT of local urban development. Adjustments reduced the global 1900-2009 temperature change  only from 0.71C to 0.70C. Wickham et al.  also used satellite data and found that urban locations in the Berkeley data set exhibited even less warming than rural stations, although not statistically significantly so, over 1950 to 2010. Studies of the broader effects of LULC since AR4 have tended to focus on the effects of irrigation on temperatures, with a large number of studies in the Californian central belt . They find cooler average temperatures and a marked reduction in DTR in areas of active irrigation and ascribe this to increased humidity; effectively a repar-	0
titioning of moist and dry energy terms. Reanalyses have also been used to estimate the LULC signature in LSAT trends. Fall et al.  found that the North American Regional Reanalysis generated overall surface air temperature trends for 1979-2003 similar to observed records. Observations-minus-reanalysis trends were most positive for barren and urban areas, in accord with the results of Lim et al.  using the NCEP/NCAR and ERA-40 reanalyses, and negative in agricultural areas. McKitrick and Michaels  and de Laat and Maurellis  assessed regression of trends with national socioeconomic and geographical indicators, concluding that UHI and related LULC have caused much of the observed LSAT warming. AR4 concluded that this correlation ceases to be statistically significant if one takes into account the fact that the locations of greatest socioeconomic development are also those that have been most warmed by atmospheric circulation changes but provided no explicit evidence for this overall assessment result. Subsequently McKitrick and Michaels  concluded that about half the reported warming trend in global-average land surface air temperature in 1980-2002 resulted from local land surface changes and faults in the observations. Schmidt  undertook a quantitative analysis that supported AR4 conclusions that much of the reported correlation largely arose due to naturally occurring climate variability and model over-fitting and was not robust. Taking these factors into account, modified analyses by McKitrick  and McKitrick and Nierenberg  still yielded significant evidence for such contamination of the record. In marked contrast to regression based studies, several studies have shown the methodologically diverse set of modern reanalysis products and the various LSAT records at global and regional levels to be similar since at least the mid-20th century . These reanalyses do not directly assimilate the LSAT measurements but rather infer LSAT estimates from an observational constraint provided by much of the rest of the global observing system, thus representing an independent estimate. A hypothesized residual significant warming artefact argued for by regression-based analyses is therefore physically inconsistent with many other components of the global observing system according to a broad range of state-of-the-art data assimilation models . Further, Efthymiadis and Jones  estimated an absolute upper limit on urban influence globally of 0.02C per decade, or about 15% of the total LSAT trends, in 1951-2009 from trends of coastal land and SST. In summary, it is indisputable that UHI and LULC are real influences on raw temperature measurements. At question is the extent to which they remain in the global products . Based primarily on the range of urban minus rural adjusted data set comparisons and the degree of agreement of these products with a broad range of reanalysis products, it is unlikely that any uncorrected urban heat-island effects and LULC change effects have raised the estimated centennial globally averaged LSAT trends by more than 10% of the reported trend . This is an average value; in some regions with rapid development, UHI and LULC change impacts on regional trends may be substantially larger. 189	0
AR4 concluded that `recent' warming  is strongly evident at all latitudes in SST over each ocean. Prominent spatio-temporal structures including the ENSO and decadal variability patterns in the Pacific Ocean  and a hemispheric asymmetry in the Atlantic Ocean were highlighted as contributors to the regional differences in surface warming rates, which in turn affect atmospheric circulation. Since AR4 the availability of metadata has increased, data completeness has improved and a number of new SST products have been produced. Intercomparisons of data obtained by different measurement methods, including satellite data, have resulted in better understanding of errors and biases in the record.	0

observer instructions and other related documents. Early data were systematically cold biased because they were made using canvas or wooden buckets that, on average, lost heat to the air before the measurements were taken. This effect has long been recognized , and prior to AR4 represented the only artefact adjusted in gridded SST products, such as HadSST2  and ERSST , which were based on `bucket correction' methods by Folland and Parker  and Smith and Reynolds , respectively. The adjustments, made using ship observations of Night Marine Air Temperature  and other sources, had a striking effect on the SST global mean estimates: note the difference in 1850-1941 between HadSST2 and International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set  curves in Figure 2.16 . Buckets of improved design and measurement methods with smaller, on average, biases came into use after 1941 ; average biases were reduced further in recent decades, but not eliminated . Increasing density of SST observations made possible the identification  and partial correction of more recent period biases . In particular, it is hypothesized that the proximity of the hot engine often biases engine room intake  measurements warm . Because of the prevalence of the ERI measurements among SST data from ships, the ship SSTs are biased warm by 0.12C to 0.18C on average compared to the buoy data . An assessment of the potential impact of modern biases can be ascertained by considering the difference	0
The traditional approach to modeling random error of in situ SST data assumed the independence of individual measurements. Kent and Berry  identified the need to account for error correlation for measurements from the same "platform" , while measurement errors from different platforms remain independent.. Kennedy et al.  achieved that by introducing platform-dependent biases, which are constant within the same platform, but change randomly from one platform to another. Accounting for such correlated errors in HadSST3 resulted in estimated error for global and hemispheric monthly means that are more than twice the estimates given by HadSST2. The uncertainty in many, but not all, components of the HadSST3 product is represented by the ensemble of its realizations . Data sets of marine air temperatures  have traditionally been restricted to nighttime series only  due to the direct solar heating effect on the daytime measurements, although corrected daytime MAT records for 1973-present are already available . Other major biases, affecting both nighttime and daytime MAT are due to increasing deck height with the general increase in the size of ships over time and non-standard measurement practices. Recently these biases were re-examined and explicit uncertainty calculation undertaken for NMAT by Kent et al. , resulting in the HadNMAT2 data set.	0

Since AR4, ATSR observations have been reprocessed with new estimation techniques . The resulting SST products seem to be more accurate than many in situ observations . In terms of monthly global means, the agreement is illustrated in Figure 2.17. By analyzing ATSR and in situ data together, Kennedy at al.  verified and extended existing models for biases and random errors of in situ data.	0
Satellite SST data sets are based on measuring electromagnetic radiation that left the ocean surface and got transmitted through the atmosphere. Because of the complexity of processes involved, the majority of such data has to be calibrated on the basis of in situ observations. The resulting data sets, however, provide a description of global SST fields with a level of spatial detail unachievable by in situ data only. The principal IR sensor is the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer . Since AR4, the AVHRR time series has been reprocessed consistently back to March 1981  to create the AVHRR Pathfinder v5.2 data set. Passive microwave data sets of SST are available since 1997 equatorward of 40 and near-globally since 2002 . They are generally less accurate than IR-based SST data sets, but their superior coverage in areas of persistent cloudiness provides SST estimates where the IR record has none . The  Along Track Scanning Radiometer ATSR) series of three sensors was designed for climate monitoring of SST	0
SST data sets form a major part of global surface temperature analyses considered in this assessment report. To use an SST data set as a boundary condition for atmospheric reanalyses products  or in atmosphere-only climate simulations , gridded data sets with complete coverage over the global ocean are typically needed. These are usually based on a special form of kriging  procedure that retains large-scale correlation structures and can accommodate very sparse data coverage. For the pre-satellite era  only in situ data are used; for the latter period some products also use AVHRR data. Figure 2.18 compares interpolated SST data sets that extend back to the 19th century with the uninterpolated HadSST3 and HadNMAT2 products. Linear trend estimates for global mean SSTs from those products updated through 2012 are presented in Table 2.6. Differences between the trends from different data sets are larger when the calculation period is shorter  or has lower quality data ; these are due mainly to different data coverage of underlying observational data sets and bias correction methods used in these products. 191	0
Starting in the 1980s each decade has been significantly warmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since the 1850s in HadCRUT4, a data set that explicitly quantifies a large number of sources of uncertainty . Each of the last three decades is also the warmest in the other two GMST data sets, but these have substantially less mature and complete uncertainty estimates, precluding such an assessment of significance of their decadal differences. The GISS and MLOST data sets fall outside the 90% CI of HadCRUT4 for several decades in the 20th century . These decadal differences could reflect residual biases in one or more data set, an incomplete treatment of uncertainties in HadCRUT4.1 or a combination of these effects . The data sets utilize different LSAT  and SST  component records  that in the case of SST differ somewhat in their multi-decadal trend behaviour .	0
In summary, it is certain that global average sea surface temperatures  have increased since the beginning of the 20th century. Since AR4, major improvements in availability of metadata and data completeness have been made, and a number of new global SST records have been produced. Intercomparisons of new SST data records obtained by different measurement methods, including satellite data, have resulted in better understanding of uncertainties and biases in the records. Although these innovations have helped highlight and quantify uncertainties and affect our understanding of the character of changes since the mid-20th century, they do not alter the conclusion that global SSTs have increased both since the 1950s and since the late 19th century.	0
AR4 concluded that the GMST had increased, with the last 50 years increasing at almost double the rate of the last 100 years. Subsequent developments in LSAT and SST have led to better understanding of the data and their uncertainties as discussed in preceding sections. This improved understanding has led to revised global products. Changes have been made to all three GMST data sets that were used in AR4 . These are now in somewhat better agreement with each other over recent years, in large part because HadCRUT4 now better samples the NH high latitude land regions  which comparisons to reanalyses had shown led to a propensity for HadCRUT3 to underestimate recent warming . 192	0
Differences between data sets are much smaller than both interannual variability and the long-term trend . Since 1901 almost the whole globe has experienced surface warming . Warming has not been linear; most warming occurred in two periods: around 1900 to around 1940 and around 1970 onwards . The two periods of global mean warming exhibit very distinct spatial signatures. The early 20th century warming was largely a NH mid- to high-latitude phenomenon, whereas the more recent warming is more global in nature. These distinctions may yield important information as to causes . Differences between data sets are larger in earlier periods , particularly prior to the 1950s when observational sampling is much more geographically incomplete ), data errors and subsequent methodological impacts are larger , and different ways of accounting for data void regions are more important .	0
three decades has been warmer than all the previous decades in the instrumental record, and the decade of the 2000s has been the warmest. The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend, show a warming of 0.85  C, over the period 1880-2012, when multiple independently produced datasets exist, about 0.89C  C over the period 1901-2012, and about 0.72  C over the period 1951-2012. The total increase between the average of the 1850-1900 period and the 2003-2012 period is 0.78  C and the total increase between the average of the 1850-1900 period and the reference period for projections 1986-2005 is 0.61  C, based on the single longest dataset available. For the longest period when calculation of regional trends is sufficiently complete , almost the entire globe has experienced surface warming. In addition to robust multi-decadal warming, global mean surface temperature exhibits substantial decadal and interannual variability. Owing to natural variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends. As one example, the rate of warming over the past 15 years  C per decade), which begins with a strong El Nino, is smaller than the rate calculated since 1951  C per decade)Trends for 15-year periods starting in 1995, 1996, and 1997 are 0.13 , 0.14  and 0.07 , respectively..	0
. This issue is discussed in the context of model behaviour, forcings and natural variability in Box 9.2 and Section 10.3.1. Regardless, all global combined LSAT and SST data sets exhibit a statistically non-significant warming trend over 1998-2012 ; 0.037C  0.085C per decade ; 0.069C  0.082C per decade ). An average of the trends from these three data sets yields an estimated change for the 1998-2012 period of 0.05  C per decade. Trends of this short length are very sensitive to the precise period selection with trends calculated in the same manner for the 15-year periods starting in 1995, 1996, and 1997 being 0.13 , 0.14  and 0.07  , respectively. In summary, it is certain that globally averaged near surface temperatures have increased since the late 19th century. Each of the past 194	0
AR4 summarized that globally the troposphere had warmed at a rate greater than the GMST over the radiosonde record, while over the shorter satellite era the GMST and tropospheric warming rates were indistinguishable. Trends in the tropics were more uncertain than global trends although even this region was concluded to be warming. Globally, the stratosphere was reported to be cooling over the satellite era starting in 1979. New advances since AR4 have highlighted the substantial degree of uncertainty in both satellite and balloon-borne radiosonde records and led to some revisions and improvements in existing products and the creation of a number of new data products.	0
2.4.4.1 Advances in Multi-Decadal Observational Records The major global radiosonde records extend back to 1958, with temperatures, measured as the balloon ascends, reported at mandatory pressure levels. Satellites have monitored tropospheric and lower stratospheric temperature trends since late 1978 through the Microwave Sounding Unit  and its follow-on Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit  since 1998. These measures of upwelling radiation represent bulk  atmospheric temperature . The `Mid-Tropospheric'  MSU channel that most directly corresponds to the troposphere has 10 to 15% of its signal from both the skin temperature of the Earth's surface and the stratosphere. Two alternative approaches have been suggested for removing the stratospheric component based on differencing of view angles  and statistical recombination  with the `Lower Stratosphere'  channel . The MSU satellite series also included a Stratospheric Sounding Unit  that measured at higher altitudes .	0
At the time of AR4 there were only two `global' radiosonde data sets that included treatment of homogeneity issues: RATPAC  and HadAT . Three additional estimates have appeared since AR4 based on novel and distinct approaches. A group at the University of Vienna have produced RAOBCORE and RICH  using ERA reanalysis products . Sherwood and colleagues developed an iterative universal kriging approach for radiosonde data to create IUK  and concluded that non-climatic data issues leading to spurious cooling remained in the deep tropics even after homogenization. The HadAT group created an automated version, undertook systematic experimentation and concluded that the parametric uncertainty  was of the same order of magnitude as the apparent climate signal . A similar ensemble approach has also been applied to the RICH product . These various ensembles and new products exhibit more tropospheric warming / less stratospheric cooling than pre-existing products at all levels. Globally the radiosonde records all imply the troposphere has warmed and the stratosphere cooled since 1958 but with uncertainty that grows with height and is much greater outside the better-sampled NH extra-tropics , where it is of the order 0.1C per decade. For MSU, AR4 considered estimates produced from three groups: UAH ; RSS  and VG2 . A new product has been created by NOAA labelled STAR, using a fundamentally distinct approach for the critical inter-satellite warm target calibration step . STAR exhibits more warming/less cooling at all levels than UAH and RSS. For MT and LS, Zou and Wang  concluded that this does not relate primarily to use of their inter-satellite calibration technique but rather differences in other processing steps. RSS also produced a parametric uncertainty ensemble  employing a Monte Carlo approach allowing methodological inter-dependencies to be fully expressed . For large-scale trends dominant	0
effects were inter-satellite offset determinations and, for tropospheric channels, diurnal drift. Uncertainties were concluded to be of the order 0.1C per decade at the global mean for both tropospheric channels  and the stratospheric channel. SSU provides the only long-term near-global temperature data above the lower stratosphere, with the series terminating in 2006. Some AMSU-A channels have replaced this capability and efforts to understand the effect of changed measurement properties have been undertaken . Until recently only one SSU data set existed , updated by Randel et al. . Liu and Weng  have produced an intermediate analysis for Channels 25 and 26 . Wang et al. , building on insights from several of these recent studies, have produced a more complete analysis. Differences between the independent estimates are much larger than differences between MSU records or radiosonde records at lower levels, with substantial inter-decadal time series behaviour departures, zonal trend structure, and global trend differences of the order 0.5C per decade . Although all SSU data sets agree that the stratosphere is cooling, there is therefore low confidence in the details above the lower stratosphere. In summary, many new data sets have been produced since AR4 from radiosondes and satellites with renewed interest in satellite measurements above the lower stratosphere. Several studies have attempted to quantify the parametric uncertainty  more rigorously. These various data sets and analyses have served to highlight the degree of uncertainty in the data and derived products.	0
2.4.4.2 Intercomparisons of Various Long-Term Radiosonde and MSU Products Since AR4 there have been a large number of intercomparisons between radiosonde and MSU data sets. Interpretation is complicated, as most studies considered data set versions that have since been superseded. Several studies compared UAH and RSS products to local, regional or global raw/homogenized radiosonde data . Early studies focussed on the time of transition from NOAA-11 to NOAA-12  which indicated an apparent issue in RSS. Christy et al.  noted that this coincided with the Mt Pinatubo eruption and that RSS was the only product, either surface or tropospheric, that exhibited tropical warming immediately after the eruption when cooling would be expected. Using reanalysis data Bengtsson and Hodges  also found evidence of a potential jump in RSS in 1993 over the tropical oceans. Mears et al.  cautioned that an El Nino event quasi-simultaneous with Pinatubo complicates interpretation. They also highlighted several other periods of disagreement between radiosonde records and MSU records. All MSU records were most uncertain when satellite orbits are drifting rapidly . Mears et al.  found that trend differences between RSS and other data sets could not be explained in many cases by parametric uncertainties in RSS alone. It was repeatedly cautioned that there were potential common biases  between the different MSU 195	0
Global Positioning System  radio occultation  currently represents the only self-calibrated SI traceable raw satellite measurements . The fundamental observation is time delay of the occulted signal's phase traversing the atmosphere. The time delay is a function of several atmospheric physical state variables. Subsequent analysis converts the time delay to temperature and other parameters, which inevitably adds some degree of uncertainty to the derived temperature data. Intercomparisons of GPS-RO products show that differences are largest for derived geophysical parameters , but are still small relative to other observing technologies . Comparisons to MSU and radiosondes  show substantive agreement in interannual behaviour, but also some multi-year drifts that require further examination before this additional data source can usefully arbitrate between different MSU and radiosonde trend estimates. Atmospheric winds are driven by thermal gradients. Radiosonde winds are far less affected by time-varying biases than their temperatures . Allen and Sherwood  initially used radiosonde wind to infer temperatures within the Tropical West Pacific warm pool region, then extended this to a global analysis  yielding a distinct tropical upper tropospheric warming trend maximum within the vertical profile, but with large uncertainty. Winds can only quantify relative changes and require an initialization  . The large uncertainty range was predominantly driven by this initialization choice, a finding later confirmed by Christy et al. , who in addition questioned the stability given the sparse geographical sampling, particularly in the tropics, and possible systematic sampling effects amongst other potential issues. Initializing closer to the tropics tended to reduce or remove the appearance of a tropical upper tropospheric warming trend maximum . There is only low confidence in trends inferred from `thermal winds' given the relative immaturity of the analyses and their large uncertainties. In summary, new technologies and approaches have emerged since AR4. However, these new technologies and approaches either constitute too short a record or are too immature to inform assessments of long-term trends at the present time.	0
2.4.4.4 Synthesis of Free Atmosphere Temperature Estimates Global-mean lower tropospheric temperatures have increased since the mid-20th century . Structural uncertainties  are larger than at the surface but it can still be concluded that globally the troposphere has warmed . On top of this long-term trend are superimposed short-term variations that are highly correlated with those at the surface but of somewhat greater amplitude. Global mean lower stratospheric temperatures have decreased since the mid20th century punctuated by short-lived warming events associated with explosive volcanic activity . However, since the mid-1990s little net change has occurred. Cooling rates are on average greater from radiosonde data sets than MSU data sets. This very likely relates to widely recognized cooling biases in radiosondes  which all data set producers explicitly caution are likely to remain to some extent in their final products . In comparison to the surface , tropospheric layers exhibit smoother geographic trends  with warming dominating cooling north of approximately 45S and greatest warming in high northern latitudes. The lower stratosphere cooled almost everywhere but this cooling exhibits substantial large-scale structure. Cooling is greatest in the highest southern latitudes and smallest in high northern latitudes. There are also secondary stratospheric cooling maxima in the mid-latitude regions of each hemisphere. Available global and regional trends from radiosondes since 1958  show agreement that the troposphere has warmed and the stratosphere cooled. While there is little ambiguity in the sign of the changes, the rate and vertical structure of change are distinctly data set dependent, particularly in the stratosphere. Differences are greatest in the tropics and SH extra-tropics where the historical radiosonde data coverage is poorest. Not shown in the figure for clarity are estimates of parametric data set uncertainties or trend-fit uncertainties--both of which are of the order of at least 0.1C per decade . Differences in trends between available radiosonde data sets are greater during the satellite era than for the full radiosonde period of record in all regions and at most levels . The RAOBCORE product exhibits greater vertical trend gradients than other data sets and it has been posited that this relates to its dependency on reanalysis fields . MSU trend estimates in the troposphere are generally bracketed by the radiosonde range. In the stratosphere MSU deep layer estimates tend to show slightly less cooling. Over both 1958-2011 and 1979-2011 there is some evidence in the radiosonde products taken as a whole that the tropical tropospheric trends increase with height. But the magnitude and the structure is highly data set dependent. In summary, based on multiple independent analyses of measurements from radiosondes and satellite sensors it is virtually certain that globally the troposphere has warmed and the stratosphere has cooled since the mid-20th century. Despite unanimous agreement on the sign of the trends, substantial disagreement exists among available estimates as to the rate of temperature changes, particularly outside the NH extratropical troposphere, which has been well sampled by radiosondes.	0
FAQ 2.1 | How Do We Know the World Has Warmed? Evidence for a warming world comes from multiple independent climate indicators, from high up in the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans. They include changes in surface, atmospheric and oceanic temperatures; glaciers; snow cover; sea ice; sea level and atmospheric water vapour. Scientists from all over the world have independently verified this evidence many times. That the world has warmed since the 19th century is unequivocal. Discussion about climate warming often centres on potential residual biases in temperature records from landbased weather stations. These records are very important, but they only represent one indicator of changes in the climate system. Broader evidence for a warming world comes from a wide range of independent physically consistent measurements of many other, strongly interlinked, elements of the climate system . A rise in global average surface temperatures is the best-known indicator of climate change. Although each year and even decade is not always warmer than the last, global surface temperatures have warmed substantially since 1900.	0
Warming land temperatures correspond closely with the observed warming trend over the oceans. Warming oceanic air temperatures, measured from aboard ships, and temperatures of the sea surface itself also coincide, as borne out by many independent analyses. The atmosphere and ocean are both fluid bodies, so warming at the surface should also be seen in the lower atmosphere, and deeper down into the upper oceans, and observations confirm that this is indeed the case. Analyses of measurements made by weather balloon radiosondes and satellites consistently show warming of the troposphere, the active weather layer of the atmosphere. More than 90% of the excess energy absorbed by the climate system since at least the 1970s has been stored in the oceans as can be seen from global records of ocean heat content going back to the 1950s. 	0
As the oceans warm, the water itself expands. This expansion is one of the main drivers of the independently observed rise in sea levels over the past century. Melting of glaciers and ice sheets also contribute, as do changes in storage and usage of water on land. A warmer world is also a moister one, because warmer air can hold more water vapour. Global analyses show that specific humidity, which measures the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, has increased over both the land and the oceans. The frozen parts of the planet--known collectively as the cryosphere--affect, and are affected by, local changes in temperature. The amount of ice contained in glaciers globally has been declining every year for more than 20 years, and the lost mass contributes, in part, to the observed rise in sea level. Snow cover is sensitive to changes in temperature, particularly during the spring, when snow starts to melt. Spring snow cover has shrunk across the NH since the 1950s. Substantial losses in Arctic sea ice have been observed since satellite records began, particularly at the time of the mimimum extent, which occurs in September at the end of the annual melt season. By contrast, the increase in Antarctic sea ice has been smaller.	0
Since AR4, existing data sets have been updated and a new data set developed. Figure 2.28 shows the century-scale variations and trends on globally and zonally averaged annual precipitation using five data sets: GHCN V2 , Global Precipitation Climatology Project V2.2  combined raingauge-satellite product , CRU TS 3.10.01 , Global Precipitation Climatology Centre V6  data set  and a reconstructed data set by Smith et al. . Each data product incorporates a different number of station series for each region. The Smith et al. product is a statistical reconstruction using Empirical Orthogonal Functions, similar to the NCDC MLOST global temperature product  that does provide coverage for most of the global surface area although only land is included here. The data sets based on in situ observations only start in 1901, but the Smith et al. data set ends in 2008, while the other three data sets contain data until at least 2010. For the longest common period of record  all datasets exhibit increases in globally averaged precipitation, with three of the four showing statistically significant changes . However, there is a factor of almost three spread in the magnitude of the change which serves to create low confidence. Global trends for the shorter period  show a mix of statistically non-significant positive and negative trends amongst the four data sets with the infilled Smith et al.  analysis showing increases and the remainder decreases. These differences among data sets indicate that long-term increases 201	0
in global precipitation discussed in AR4 are uncertain, owing in part to issues in data coverage in the early part of the 20th century . In summary, confidence in precipitation change averaged over global land areas is low for the years prior to 1950 and medium afterwards because of insufficient data, particularly in the earlier part of the record. Available globally incomplete records show mixed and non-significant long-term trends in reported global mean changes. Further, when virtually all the land area is filled in using a reconstruction method, the resulting time series shows less change in land-based precipitation since 1900.	0
The latitude band plots in Figure 2.28 suggest that precipitation over tropical land areas  has increased over the last decade reversing the drying trend that occurred from the mid-1970s to mid1990s. As a result the period 1951-2008 shows no significant overall trend in tropical land precipitation in any of the datasets . Longer term trends  in the tropics, shown in Table 2.10, are also non-significant for each of the four data sets. The mid-latitudes of the NH  show an overall increase in precipitation from 1901 to 2008 with statistically significant trends for each data set. For the shorter period  the trends are also positive but non-significant for three of the four data sets. For the high latitudes of the NH  where data completeness permits trend calculations solely for the 1951-2008 period, all datasets show increases but there is a wide range of magnitudes and the infilled Smith et al. series shows small and insignificant trends . Fewer data from high latitude stations make these trends less certain and yield low confidence in resulting zonal band average estimates. In the mid-latitudes of the SH  there is limited evidence of long-term increases with three data sets showing significant trends for the 1901-2008 period but GHCN having negative trends that are not significant. For the 1951-2008 period changes in SH mid-latitude precipitation are less certain, with one data set showing a significant trend towards drying, two showing non-significant drying trends and the final dataset suggesting increases in precipitation. All data sets show an abrupt decline in SH mid-latitude precipitation in the early 2000s  consistent with enhanced drying that has very recently recovered. These results for latitudinal changes are broadly consistent with the global satellite observations for the 1979-2008 period  and land-based gauge measurements for the 1950-1999 period . In AR4, maps of observed trends of annual precipitation for 1901-2005 were calculated using GHCN interpolated to a 5 x 5 latitude/longitude grid. Trends  were calculated for each grid box and showed statistically significant changes, particularly increases in eastern and northwestern North America, parts of Europe and Russia, southern South America and Australia, declines in the Sahel region of Africa, and a few scattered declines elsewhere. Figure 2.29 shows the spatial variability of long-term trends  and more recent trends  over land in annual precipitation using the CRU, GHCN and GPCC data sets. The trends are computed from land-only grid box time series using each native data set grid resolution. The patterns of these absolute trends  are broadly similar to the trends  relative	0
to local climatology . Increases for the period 1901-2010 are seen in the mid- and higher-latitudes of both the NH and SH consistent with the reported changes for latitudinal bands. At the grid box scale, statistically significant trends occur in most of the same areas, in each data set but are far more limited than for temperature over a similar length period . The GPCC map shows the most areas with significant trends. Comparing the maps in Figure 2.29, most areas for which trends can be calculated for both periods show similar trends between the 1901-2010 period and the 1951-2010 period with few exceptions . Trends over shorter periods can differ from those implied for the longest periods. For example, since the late 1980s trends in the Sahel region have been significantly positive .	0
with increases in maximum and minimum temperatures in the western Himalaya. Serquet et al.  analyzed snowfall and rainfall days since 1961 and found the proportion of snowfall days to rainfall days in Switzerland was declining in association with increasing temperatures. Scherrer and Appenzeller  found a trend in a pattern of variability of snowfall in the Swiss Alps that indicated decreasing snow at low altitudes relative to high altitudes, but with large decadal variability in key snow indicators . Van Ommen and Morgan  draw a link between increased snowfall in coastal East Antarctica and increased southwest Western Australia drought. However, Monaghan and Bromwich  found an increase in snow accumulation over all Antarctica from the late 1950s to 1990, then a decline to 2004. Thus snowfall changes in Antarctica remain uncertain.	0
In summary, when averaged over the land areas of the mid-latitudes of the NH, all datasets show a likely overall increase in precipitation . For all other zones one or more of data sparsity, quality, or a lack of quantitative agreement amongst available estimates yields low confidence in characterisation of such long-term trends in zonally averaged precipitation. Nevertheless, changes in some more regional or shorter-term recent changes can be quantified. It is likely there was an abrupt decline in SH mid-latitude precipitation in the early 2000s consistent with enhanced drying that has very recently recovered. Precipitation in the tropical land areas has increased  over the last decade, reversing the drying trend that occurred from the mid-1970s to mid-1990s reported in AR4.	0
2.5.1.3 Changes in Snowfall AR4 draws no conclusion on global changes in snowfall. Changes in snowfall are discussed on a region-by-region basis, but focussed mainly on North America and Eurasia. Statistically significant increases were found in most of Canada, parts of northern Europe and Russia. A number of areas showed a decline in the number of snowfall events, especially those where climatological averaged temperatures were close to 0C and where warming led to earlier onset of spring. Also, an increase in lake-effect snowfall was found for areas near the North American Great Lakes. Since AR4, most published literature has considered again changes in snowfall in North America. These studies have confirmed that more winter-time precipitation is falling as rain rather than snow in the western USA , the Pacific Northwest and Central USA . Kunkel et al.  analyzed trends using a specially quality-controlled data set of snowfall observations over the contiguous USA and found that snowfall has been declining in the western USA, northeastern USA and southern margins of the seasonal snow region, but increasing in the western Great Plains and Great Lakes regions. Snowfall in Canada has increased mainly in the north while a significant decrease was observed in the southwestern part of the country for 1950-2009 . Other regions that have been analyzed include Japan , where warmer winters in the heavy snowfall areas on Honshu are associated with decreases in snowfall and precipitation in general. Shekar et al.  found declines in total seasonal snowfall along 204	0
AR4 concluded that runoff and river discharge generally increased at high latitudes, with some exceptions. No consistent long-term trend in discharge was reported for the world's major rivers on a global scale. River discharge is unique among water cycle components in that it both spatially and temporally integrates surplus waters upstream within a catchment  which makes it well suited for in situ monitoring . The most recent comprehensive analyses  do not support earlier work  that reported an increasing trend in global river discharge associated with global warming during the 20th century. It must be noted that many if not most large rivers, especially those for which a long-term streamflow record exists, have been impacted by human influences such as dam construction or land use, so results must be interpreted with caution. Dai et al.  assembled a data set of 925 most downstream stations on the largest rivers monitoring 80% of the global ocean draining land areas and capturing 73% of the continental runoff. They found that discharges in about one-third of the 200 largest rivers  show statistically significant trends during 1948-2004, with the rivers having downward trends  outnumbering those with upward trends . Decreases in streamflow were found over many low and mid-latitude river basins such as the Yellow River in northern China since 1960s  where precipitation has decreased. Increases in streamflow during the latter half of the 20th century also have been reported over regions with increased precipitation, such as parts of the USA , and in the Yangtze River in southern China . In the Amazon basin an increase of discharge extremes is observed over recent decades . For France, Giuntoli et al.  found that the sign of the temporal trends in natural streamflows varies with period studied. In that case study, significant correlations between median to low flows and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation  result in long quasi-periodic oscillations.	0
At high latitudes, increasing winter base flow and mean annual stream flow resulting from possible permafrost thawing were reported in northwest Canada . Rising minimum daily flows also have been observed in northern Eurasian rivers . For ocean basins other than the Arctic, and for the global ocean as a whole, the data for continental discharge show small or downward trends, which are statistically significant for the Pacific . Precipitation is a major driver for the discharge trends and for the large interannual-to-decadal variations . However, for the Arctic drainage areas, Adam and Lettenmaier  found that upward trends in streamflow are not accompanied by increasing precipitation, especially over Siberia, based on available observations. Zhang et al.  argued that precipitation measurements are sparse and exhibit large cold-season biases in the Arctic drainage areas and hence there would be large uncertianties using these data to investigate their influence on streamflow. Recently, Stahl et al.  and Stahl and Tallaksen  investigated streamflow trends based on a data set of near-natural streamflow records from more than 400 small catchments in 15 countries across Europe for 1962-2004. A regional coherent pattern of annual streamflow trends was revealed with negative trends in southern and eastern regions, and generally positive trends elsewhere. Subtle regional differences in the subannual changes in various streamflow metrics also can be captured in regional studies such as by Monk et al.  for Canadian rivers. In summary, the most recent comprehensive analyses lead to the conclusion that confidence is low for an increasing trend in global river discharge during the 20th century.	0
AR4 concluded that decreasing trends were found in records of pan evaporation over recent decades over the USA, India, Australia, New Zealand, China and Thailand and speculated on the causes including decreased surface solar radiation, sunshine duration, increased specific humidity and increased clouds. However, AR4 also reported that direct measurements of evapotranspiration over global land areas are scarce, and concluded that reanalysis evaporation fields are not reliable because they are not well constrained by precipitation and radiation. Since AR4 gridded data sets have been developed that estimate actual evapotranspiration from either atmospheric forcing and thermal remote sensing, sometimes in combination with direct measurements , or interpolation of FLUXNET data using regression techniques, providing an unprecedented look at global evapotranspiration . On a global scale, evapotranspiration over land increased from the early 1980s up to the late 1990s  and Wang et al.  found that global evapotranspiration increased at a rate of 0.6 W m-2 per decade for the period 1982-2002. After 1998, a lack of moisture availability in SH land areas, particularly decreasing soil moisture, has acted as a constraint to further increase of global evapotranspiration .	0
Zhang et al.  found decreasing pan evaporation at stations across the Tibetan Plateau, even with increasing air temperature. Similarly, decreases in pan evaporation were also found for northeastern India  and the Canadian Prairies . A continuous decrease in reference and pan evaporation for the period 1960-2000 was reported by Xu et al.  for a humid region in China, consistent with reported continuous increase in aerosol levels over China . Roderick et al.  examined the relationship between pan evaporation changes and many of the possible causes listed above using a physical model and conclude that many of the decreases  cited previously are related to declining wind speeds and to a lesser extent decreasing solar radiation. Fu et al.  provided an overview of pan evaporation trends and concluded the major possible causes, changes in wind speed, humidity and solar radiation, have been occurring, but that the importance of each is regionally dependent. The recent increase in incoming shortwave radiation in regions with decreasing aerosol concentrations  can explain positive evapotranspiration trends only in the humid part of Europe. In semiarid and arid regions, trends in evapotranspiration largely follow trends in precipitation . Trends in surface winds  and CO2  also alter the partitioning of available energy into evapotranspiration and sensible heat. While surface wind trends may explain pan evaporation trends over Australia , their impact on actual evapotranspiration is limited due to the compensating effect of boundary-layer feedbacks . In vegetated regions, where a large part of evapotranspiration comes from transpiration through plants' stomata, rising CO2 concentrations can lead to reduced stomatal opening and evapotranspiration . Additional regional effects that impact evapotranspiration trends are lengthening of the growing season and land use change. In summary, there is medium confidence that pan evaporation continued to decline in most regions studied since AR4 related to changes in wind speed, solar radiation and humidity. On a global scale, evapotranspiration over land increased  from the early 1980s up to the late 1990s. After 1998, a lack of moisture availability in SH land areas, particularly decreasing soil moisture, has acted as a constraint to further increase of global evapotranspiration.	0
AR4 reported widespread increases in surface air moisture content since 1976, along with near-constant relative humidity over large scales though with some significant changes specific to region, time of day or season. In good agreement with previous analysis from Dai , Willett et al.  show widespread increasing specific humidity across the globe from the homogenized gridded monthly mean anomaly product HadCRUH . Both Dai and HadCRUH products that are blended land and ocean data products end in 2003 but HadISDH   and the NOCS product  are available over the land and ocean respectively through 2012. There 205	0
Since 2000 surface specific humidity over land has remained largely unchanged  whereas land areas have on average warmed slightly , implying a reduction in land region relative humidity. This may be linked to the greater warming of the land surface relative to the ocean surface . The marine specific humidity , like that over land, shows widespread increases that correlate strongly with SST. However, there is a marked decline in marine relative humidity around 1982. This is reported in Willett et al.  where its origin is concluded to be a non-climatic data issue owing to a change in reporting practice for dewpoint temperature.	0
2.5.5.2 Global Positioning System Since the early 1990s, estimates of column integrated water vapour have been obtained from ground-based Global Positioning System  receivers. An international network started with about 100 stations in 1997 and has currently been expanded to more than 500  stations. Several studies have compiled GPS water vapour data sets for climate studies . Using such data, Mears et al.  demonstrated general agreement of the interannual anomalies between ocean-based satellite and land-based GPS column integrated water vapour data. The interannual water vapour anomalies are closely tied to the atmospheric temperature changes in a manner consistent with that expected from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. Jin et al.  found an average column integrated water vapour trend of about 2 kg m-2 per decade during 1994-2006 for 150  stations over the globe, with positive trends at most NH stations and negative trends in the SH. However, given the short length  of the GPS records, the estimated trends are very sensitive to the start and end years and the analyzed time period .	0
2.5.5.3 Satellite AR4 reported positive decadal trends in lower and upper tropospheric water vapour based on satellite observations for the period 1988-2004. Since AR4, there has been continued evidence for increases in lower tropospheric water vapour from microwave satellite measurements of column integrated water vapour over oceans  and globally from satellite measurements of spectrally resolved reflected solar radiation . The interannual variability and longer-term trends in column-integrated water vapour over oceans are closely tied to changes in SST at the global scale and interannual anomalies show remarkable agreement with low-level specific humidity anomalies from HadCRUH . The rate of moistening at large spatial scales over oceans is close to that expected from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation  with invariant relative humidity . Satellite measurements also indicate that the globally averaged upper tropospheric relative humidity has changed little over the period 1979-2010 while the troposphere has warmed, implying an increase in the mean water vapour mass in the upper troposphere . Interannual variations in temperature and upper tropospheric water vapour from IR satellite data are consistent with a constant RH	0
humidity trends at the largest geographical scales. On average, the impact of the correction procedures is to remove an artificial temporal trend towards drying in the raw data and indicate a positive trend in free tropospheric specific humidity over the period of record. In each analysis, the rate of increase in the free troposphere is concluded to be largely consistent with that expected from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation . There is no evidence for a significant change in free tropospheric relative humidity, although a decrease in relative humidity at lower levels is observed . Indeed, McCarthy et al.  show close agreement between their radiosonde product at the lowest levels and HadCRUH .	0
b ehavior at large spatial scales . On decadal time-scales, increased GHG concentrations reduce clear-sky outgoing long-wave radiation , thereby influencing inferred relationships between moisture and temperature. Using Meteosat IR radiances, Brogniez et al.  demonstrated that interannual variations in free tropospheric humidity over subtropical dry regions are heavily influenced by meridional mixing between the deep tropics and the extra tropics. Regionally, upper tropospheric humidity changes in the tropics were shown to relate strongly to the movement of the ITCZ based upon microwave satellite data . Shi and Bates  found an increase in upper tropospheric humidity over the equatorial tropics from 1979 to 2008. However there was no significant trend found in tropical-mean or global-mean averages, indicating that on these time and space scales the upper troposphere has seen little change in relative humidity over the past 30 years. While microwave satellite measurements have become increasingly relied upon for studies of upper tropospheric humidity, the absence of a homogenized data set across multiple satellite platforms presents some difficulty in documenting coherent trends from these records .	0
Using NCEP reanalyses for the period 1973-2007, Paltridge et al.  found negative trends in specific humidity above 850 hPa over both the tropics and southern mid-latitudes, and above 600 hPa in the NH mid-latitudes. However, as noted in AR4, reanalysis products suffer from time dependent biases and have been shown to simulate unrealistic trends and variability over the ocean  . Some reanalysis products do reproduce observed variability in low level humidity over land , more complete assesments of multiple reanalysis products yield substantially different and even opposing trends in free tropospheric specific humidity . Consequently, reanalysis products are still considered to be unsuitable for the analysis of tropospheric water vapour trends . In summary, radiosonde, GPS and satellite observations of tropospheric water vapour indicate very likely increases at near global scales since the 1970s occurring at a rate that is generally consistent with the Clausius-Clapeyron relation  and the observed increase in atmospheric temperature. Significant trends in tropospheric relative humidity at large spatial scales have not been observed, with the exception of near-surface air over land where relative humidity has decreased in recent years .	0
2.5.6.1 Surface Observations AR4 reported that surface-observed total cloud cover may have increased over many land areas since the middle of the 20th century, including the USA, the former USSR, Western Europe, mid-latitude Canada and Australia. A few regions exhibited decreases, including China and central Europe. Trends were less globally consistent since the early 1970s, with regional reductions in cloud cover reported for western Asia and Europe but increases over the USA. Analyses since AR4 have indicated decreases in cloud occurrence/cover in recent decades over Poland , China and the Tibetan Plateau , in particular for upper level clouds  and also over Africa, Eurasia and in particular South America . Increased frequency of overcast conditions has been reported for some regions, such as Canada, from 1953 to 2002 , with no statistically significant trends evident over Australia  and North America . A global analysis of surface observations spanning the period 1971-2009  indicates a small decline in total cloud cover of about 0.4% per decade which is largely attributed to declining mid- and high-level cloud cover and is most prominent in the middle latitudes. Regional variability in surface-observed cloudiness over the ocean appeared more credible than zonal and global mean variations in AR4. Multidecadal changes in upper-level cloud cover and total cloud cover over particular areas of the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean were consistent with island precipitation records and SST variability. This has been extended more recently by Deser et al. , who found that an 208	0
2.5.6.2 Satellite Observations Satellite cloud observations offer the advantage of much better spatial and temporal coverage compared to surface observations. However they require careful efforts to identify and correct for temporal discontinuities in the data sets associated with orbital drift, sensor degradation, and inter-satellite calibration differences. AR4 noted that there were substantial uncertainties in decadal trends of cloud cover in all satellite data sets available at the time and concluded that there was no clear consensus regarding the decadal changes in total cloud cover. Since AR4 there has been continued effort to assess the quality of and develop improvements to multi-decadal cloud products from operational satellite platforms . Several satellite data sets offer multi-decadal records of cloud cover . AR4 noted that there were discrepancies in global cloud cover trends between ISCCP and other satellite data products, notably a large downward trend of global cloudiness in ISCCP since the late 1980s which is inconsistent with PATMOS-x and surface observations . Recent work has confirmed the conclusion of AR4, that much of the downward trend in ISCCP is spurious and an artefact of changes in satellite viewing geometry . An assesment of long-term variations in global-mean cloud amount from nine different satellite data sets by Stubenrauch et al.  found differences between data sets were comparable in magnitude to the interannual variability . Such inconsistencies result from differnces in sampling as well as changes in instrument calibration and inhibit an accurate assessment of global-scale cloud cover trends. Satellite observations of low-level marine clouds suggest no long-term trends in cloud liquid water path or optical properties . On regional scales, trends in cloud properties over China have been linked to changes in aerosol concentrations  . In summary, surface-based observations show region- and height-specific variations and trends in cloudiness but there remains substantial ambiguity regarding global-scale cloud variations and trends, especially from satellite observations. Although trends of cloud cover are consistent between independent data sets in certain regions, substantial ambiguity and therefore low confidence remains in the observations of global-scale cloud variability and trends.	0
impact on society and ecosystems compared to changes in mean climate . More recently a comprehensive assessment of observed changes in extreme events was undertaken by the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation  . Data availability, quality and consistency especially affect the statistics of extremes and some variables are particularly sensitive to changing measurement practices over time. For example, historical tropical cyclone records are known to be heterogeneous owing to changing observing technology and reporting protocols  and when records from multiple ocean basins are combined to explore global trends, because data quality and reporting protocols vary substantially between regions . Similar problems have been discovered when analysing wind extremes, because of the sensitivity of measurements to changing instrumentation and observing practice . Numerous regional studies indicate that changes observed in the frequency of extremes can be explained or inferred by shifts in the overall probability distribution of the climate variable . However, it should be noted that these studies refer to counts of threshold exceedance-- frequency, duration--which closely follow mean changes. Departures from high percentiles/return periods  are highly sensitive to changes in the shape and scale parameters of the distribution  and geographical location. Debate continues over whether variance as well as mean changes are affecting global temperature extremes  as illustrated in Figure 1.8 and FAQ 2.2, Figure 1. In the following sections the conclusions from both AR4 and SREX are reviewed along with studies subsequent to those assessments.	0
AR4 concluded that it was very likely that a large majority of global land areas had experienced decreases in indices of cold extremes and increases in indices of warm extremes, since the middle of the 20th century, consistent with warming of the climate. In addition, globally averaged multi-day heat events had likely exhibited increases over a similar period. SREX updated AR4 but came to similar conclusions while using the revised AR5 uncertainty guidance . Further evidence since then indicates that the level of confidence that the majority of warm and cool extremes show warming remains high.	0
A large amount of evidence continues to support the conclusion that most global land areas analysed have experienced significant warming of both maximum and minimum temperature extremes since about 1950 . Changes in the occurrence of cold and warm days  are generally less marked . ENSO  influences both maximum and minimum temperature variability especially around the Pacific Rim  but often affecting cold and warm extremes differently. Different data sets using different gridding methods and/or input data  indicate large coherent trends in temperature extremes globally, associated with warming . The level of quality control varies between these data sets. For example, HadEX2  uses more rigorous quality control which leads to a reduced station sample compared to GHCNDEX  or HadGHCND . However, despite these issues data sets compare remarkably consistently even though the station networks vary through time . Other data sets that have assessed these indices, but cover a shorter period, also agree very well over the period of overlapping data, e.g., HadEX  and Duke . The shift in the distribution of nighttime temperatures appears greater than daytime temperatures although whether distribution changes are simply linked to increases in the mean or other moments is an active area of research . Indeed, all data sets examined , indicate a faster increase in minimum temperature extremes than maximum temperature extremes. While DTR declines have only been assessed with medium confidence , confidence of accelerated increases in minimum temperature extremes compared to maximum temperature extremes is high due to the more consistent patterns of warming in minimum temperature extremes globally. Regional changes in a range of climate indices are assessed in Table 2.13. These indicate likely increases across most continents in unusually warm days and nights and/or reductions in unusually cold days and nights including frosts. Some regions have experienced close to a doubling of the occurrence of warm and a halving of the occurrence of cold nights, for example, parts of the Asia-Pacific region  and parts of Eurasia  since the mid-20th century. Changes in both local and global SST patterns  and large scale circulation patterns  have been shown to be associated with regional changes in temperature extremes (Barrucand et al., 2008; Scaife et al., 2008;	0

Alexander et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012), particularly in regions around the Pacific Rim . Globally, there is evidence of large-scale warming trends in the extremes of temperature, especially minimum temperature, since the beginning of the 20th century . There are some exceptions to this large-scale warming of temperature extremes including central North America, eastern USA  and some parts of South America  which indicate changes consistent with cooling in these locations. However, these exceptions appear to be mostly associated with changes in maximum temperatures . The so-called `warming hole' in central North America and eastern USA, where temperatures have cooled relative to the significant warming elsewhere in the region, is associated with observed changes in the hydrological cycle and land-atmosphere interaction  and decadal and multi-decadal variability linked with the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans . Since AR4 many studies have analysed local to regional changes in multi-day temperature extremes in more detail, specifically addressing different heat wave aspects such as frequency, intensity, duration and spatial extent . Several high-profile heat waves have occurred in recent years , Australia in 2009 , Russia in 2010  and USA in 2010/2011   which have had severe impacts . Heat waves are often associated with quasi-stationary anticyclonic circulation anomalies that produce prolonged hot conditions at the surface , but long-term changes in the persistence of these anomalies are still relatively poorly understood . Heat waves can also be amplified by pre-existing dry soil conditions in transitional climate zones  and the persistence of those soil-mositure anomalies . Dry soil-moisture conditions are either induced by precipitation deficits	0
or evapotranspiration excesses , or a combination of both . This amplification of soil moisture-temperature feedbacks is suggested to have partly enhanced the duration of extreme summer heat waves in southeastern Europe during the latter part of the 20th century , with evidence emerging of a signature in other moisture-limited regions . Table 2.13 shows that there has been a likely increasing trend in the frequency of heatwaves since the middle of the 20th century in Europe and Australia and across much of Asia where there are sufficient data. However, confidence on a global scale is medium owing to lack of studies over Africa and South America but also in part owing to differences in trends depending on how heatwaves are defined . Using monthly means as a proxy for heatwaves Coumou et al.  and Hansen et al.  indicate that record-breaking temperatures in recent decades substantially exceed what would be expected by chance but caution is required when making inferences between these studies and those that deal with multi-day events and/ or use more complex definitions for heatwave events. There is also evidence in some regions that periods prior to the 1950s had more heatwaves  whereas conversely in other regions heatwave trends may have been underestimated owing to poor quality and/or consistency of data  over Western Europe; Kuglitsch et al.  over the Mediterranean). Recent available studies also suggest that the number of cold spells has reduced significantly since the 1950s . In summary, new analyses continue to support the AR4 and SREX conclusions that since about 1950 it is very likely that the numbers of cold days and nights have decreased and the numbers of warm days and nights have increased overall on the global scale, that is, for land areas with sufficient data. It is likely that such changes have also occurred across most of North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. There is low to medium confidence in historical trends in daily temperature extremes in Africa and South America as there is either	0
2.6.2.1 Precipitation Extremes AR4 concluded that substantial increases are found in heavy precipitation events. It was likely that annual heavy precipitation events had disproportionately increased compared to mean changes between 1951 and 2003 over many mid-latitude regions, even where there had been a reduction in annual total precipitation. Rare precipitation  events were likely to have increased over regions with sufficient data since the late 19th century. SREX supported this view, as have subsequent analyses, but noted large spatial variability within and between regions . Given the diverse climates across the globe, it has been difficult to provide a universally valid definition of `extreme precipitation'. However, Box 2.4 Table 1 indicates some of the common definitions that are used in the scientific literature. In general, statistical tests indicate changes in precipitation extremes are consistent with a wetter climate , although with a less spatially coherent pattern of change than temperature, in that there are large areas that show increasing trends and large areas that show decreasing trends and a lower level of statistical significance than for temperature change . Using R95p and SDII indices , Figures 2.33a and 2.33b show these areas for heavy precipitation amounts and precipitation intensity where sufficient data are available in the HadEX2 data set  although there are more areas showing significant increases than decreases. Although changes in large-scale circulation patterns have a substantial influence on precipitation extremes globally , Westra et al.  showed, using in situ data over land, that trends in the wettest day of the year indicate more increases than would be expected by chance. Over the tropical oceans satellite measurements show an increase in the frequency of the heaviest rainfall during warmer  years . Regional trends in precipitation extremes since the middle of the 20th century are varied . In most continents confidence in trends is not higher than medium except in North America and Europe where there have been likely increases in either the frequency or intensity of heavy precipitation. This assessment increases to very likely for central North America. For North America it is also likely that increases	0
have occurred during the whole of the 20th century . For South America the most recent integrative studies indicate heavy rain events are increasing in frequency and intensity over the contient as a whole . For Europe and the Mediterranean, the assessment masks some regional and seasonal variation. For example, much of the increase reported in Table 2.13 is found in winter although with decreasing trends in some other regions such as northern Italy, Poland and some Mediterranean coastal sites . There are mixed regional trends across Asia and Oceania but with some indication that increases are being observed in more regions than decreases while recent studies focused on Africa, in general, have not found significant trends in extreme precipitation . The above studies generally use indices which reflect `moderate' extremes, for example, events occurring as often as 5% or 10% of the time . Only a few regions have sufficient data to assess trends in rarer precipitation events reliably, for example, events occurring on average once in several decades. Using Extreme Value Theory, DeGaetano  showed a 20% reduction in the return period for extreme precipitation events over large parts of the contiguous USA from 1950 to 2007. For Europe from 1951 to 2010, Van den Besselaar et al.  reported a median reduction in 5- to 20-year return periods of 21%, with a range between 2% and 58% depending on the subregion and season. This decrease in return times for rare extremes is qualitatively similar to the increase in moderate extremes for these regions reported above, and also consistent with earlier local results for the extreme tail of the distribution reported in AR4. The aforementioned studies refer to daily precipitation extremes, although rainfall will often be limited to part of the day only. The literature on sub-daily scales is too limited for a global assessment although it is clear that analysis and framing of questions regarding sub-daily precipitation extremes is becoming more critical . Available regional studies have shown results that are even more complex than for daily precipitation and with variations in the spatial patterns of trends depending on event formulation and duration. However, regional studies show indications of more increasing than decreasing trends   . Some studies present evidence of scaling of sub-daily precipitation with temperature that is outside that expected from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation  , but scaling beyond that expected from thermodynamic theories is controversial . In summary, further analyses continue to support the AR4 and SREX conclusions that it is likely that since 1951 there have been statistically significant increases in the number of heavy precipitation events  in more regions than there have been statistically significant decreases, but there are strong regional and subregional variations in the trends. In particular, many regions present statistically non-significant or negative trends, and, where seasonal changes have been assessed, there are also variations between seasons . The 213	0
AR5 WGII assesses floods in regional detail accounting for the fact that trends in floods are strongly influenced by changes in river management . Although the most evident flood trends appear to be in northern high latitudes, where observed warming trends have been largest, in some regions no evidence of a trend in extreme flooding has been found, for example, over Russia based on daily river discharge . Other studies for Europe  and Asia  show evidence for upward, downward or no trend in the magnitude and frequency of floods, so that there is currently no clear and widespread evidence for observed changes in flooding except for the earlier spring flow in snow-dominated regions . In summary, there continues to be a lack of evidence and thus low confidence regarding the sign of trend in the magnitude and/or frequency of floods on a global scale.	0
2.6.2.3 Droughts AR4 concluded that droughts had become more common, especially in the tropics and sub-tropics since about 1970. SREX provided a comprehensive assessment of changes in observed droughts , updated the conclusions provided by AR4 and stated that the type of drought considered and the complexities in defining drought  can substantially affect the conclusions regarding trends on a global scale . Based on evidence since AR4, SREX concluded that there were not enough direct observations of dryness to suggest high confidence in observed trends globally, although there was medium confidence that since the 1950s some regions of the world have experienced more intense and longer droughts. The differences between AR4 and SREX are due primarily to analyses post-AR4, differences in how both assessments considered drought and updated IPCC uncertainty guidance. There are very few direct measurements of drought related variables, such as soil moisture , so drought proxies  and hydrological drought proxies  are often used to assess drought. The chosen proxy  and time scale can strongly affect the ranking of drought events . Analyses of these indirect indices come with substantial uncertainties. For example, PDSI may not 214	0
be comparable across climate zones. A self-calibrating  PDSI can replace the fixed empirical constants in PDSI with values representative of the local climate . Furthermore, for studies using simulated soil moisture, the type of potential evapotranspiration model used can lead to significant differences in the estimation of the regions affected and the areal extent of drought , but the overall effect of a more physically realistic parameterisation is debated . Because drought is a complex variable and can at best be incompletely represented by commonly used drought indices, discrepancies in the interpretation of changes can result. For example, Sheffield and Wood  found decreasing trends in the duration, intensity and severity of drought globally. Conversely, Dai  found a general global increase in drought, although with substantial regional variation and individual events dominating trend signatures in some regions . Studies subsequent to these continue to provide somewhat different conclusions on trends in global droughts and/ or dryness since the middle of the 20th century . Van der Schrier et al. , using monthly sc-PDSI, found no strong case either for notable drying or moisture increase on a global scale over the periods 1901-2009 or 1950-2009, and this largely agrees with the results of Sheffield et al.  over the latter period. A comparison between the sc-PDSI calculated by van der Schrier et al.  and that of Dai  shows that the dominant mode of variability is very similar, with a temporal evolution suggesting a trend toward drying. However, the same analysis for the 1950-2009 period shows an initial increase in drying in the Van der Schrier et al. data set, followed by a decrease from the mid-1980s onwards, while the Dai data show a continuing increase until 2000. The difference in trends between the sc-PDSI data set of Van der Schrier et al. and Dai appears to be due to the different calibration periods used, the shorter 1950- 1979 period in the latter study resulting in higher index values from 1980 onwards, although the associated spatial patterns are similar. In addition, the observed precipitation forcing data set differs between studies, with van der Schrier et al.  and Sheffield et al.  using CRU TS 3.10.01 . This data set uses fewer stations and has been wetter than some other precipitation products in the last couple of decades , although the best data set to use is still an open question. Despite this, a measure of sc-PDSI with potential evapotranspiration estimated using the Penman-Montieth equation shows an increase in the percentage of land area in drought since 1950 , while van der Schrier et al.  also finds a slight increase in the percentage of land area in severe drought using the same measure. This is qualitatively consistent with the trends in surface soil moisture found for the shorter period 1988-2010 by Dorigo et al.  using a new multi-satellite data set and changes in observed streamflow . However all these studies draw somewhat different conclusions and the compelling arguments both for  and against  a significant increase in the land area experiencing drought has hampered global assessment.	0
Studies that support an increasing trend towards the land area affected by drought seem to be at odds with studies that look at trends in dryness . For example, Donat et al.  found that the annual maximum number of consecutive dry days has declined since the 1950s in more regions than it has increased . However, only regions in Russia and the USA indicate significant changes and there is a lack of information for this index over large regions, especially Africa. Most other studies focussing on global dryness find similar results, with decadal variability dominating longer-term trends . However, Giorgi et al.  indicate that `hydroclimatic intensity' , a measure which combines both dry spell length and precipitation intensity, has increased over the latter part of the 20th century in response to a warming climate. They show that positive trends  are most marked in Europe, India, parts of South America and East Asia although trends appear to have decreased  in Australia and northern South America . Data availability, quality and length of record remain issues in drawing conclusions on a global scale, however.	0
In summary, the current assessment concludes that there is not enough evidence at present to suggest more than low confidence in a global-scale observed trend in drought or dryness  since the middle of the 20th century, owing to lack of direct observations, geographical inconsistencies in the trends, and dependencies of inferred trends on the index choice. Based on updated studies, AR4 conclusions regarding global increasing trends in drought since the 1970s were probably overstated. However, it is likely that the frequency and intensity of drought has increased in the Mediterranean and West Africa and decreased in central North America and north-west Australia since 1950.	0

AR4 concluded that it was likely that an increasing trend had occurred in intense tropical cyclone activity since 1970 in some regions but that there was no clear trend in the annual numbers of tropical cyclones. Subsequent assessments, including SREX and more recent literature indicate that it is difficult to draw firm conclusions with respect to the confidence levels associated with observed trends prior to the satellite era and in ocean basins outside of the North Atlantic. Section 14.6.1 discusses changes in tropical storms in detail. Current data sets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century and it remains uncertain whether any reported long-term increases in tropical cyclone frequency are robust, after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities . Regional trends in tropical cyclone frequency and the frequency of very intense tropical cyclones have been identified in the 216	0
Another extreme aspect of the hydrological cycle is severe local weather phenomena such as hail or thunder storms. These are not well observed in many parts of the world because the density of surface meteorological observing stations is too coarse to measure all such events. Moreover, homogeneity of existing reporting is questionable . Alternatively, measures of severe thunderstorms or hailstorms can be derived by assessing the environmental conditions that are favourable for their formation but this method is very uncertain . SREX highlighted studies such as those of Brooks and Dotzek , who found significant variability but no clear trend in the past 50 years in severe thunderstorms in a region east of the Rocky Mountains in the USA, Cao , who found an increasing frequency of severe hail events in Ontario, Canada during the period 1979-2002 and Kunz et al. , who found that hail days significantly increased during the period 1974-2003 in southwest Germany. Hailpad studies from Italy  and France  suggest slight increases in larger hail sizes and a correlation between the fraction of precipitation falling as hail with average summer temperature while in Argentina between 1960 and 2008 the annual number of hail events was found to be increasing in some regions and decreasing in others . In China between 1961 and 2005, the number of hail days has been found to generally decrease, with the highest occurrence between 1960 and 1980 but with a sharp drop since the mid-1980s . However, there is little consistency in hail size changes in different regions of China since 1980 . Remote sensing offers a potential alterative to surface-based meteorological networks for detecting changes in small scale severe weather phenomenon such as proxy measurements of lightning from satellites  but there remains little convincing evidence that changes in severe thunderstorms or hail have occurred since the middle of the 20th century .	0
North Atlantic and these appear robust since the 1970s  . However, argument reigns over the cause of the increase and on longer time scales the fidelity of these trends is debated  with different methods for e stimating undercounts in the earlier part of the record providing mixed conclusions . No robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin. Measures of land-falling tropical cyclone frequency  are generally considered to be more reliable than counts of all storms which tend to be strongly influenced by those that are weak and/or short lived. Callaghan and Power  find a statistically significant decrease in Eastern Australia land-falling tropical cyclones since the late 19th century although including 2010/2011 season data this trend becomes non-significant . Significant trends are not found in other oceans on shorter time scales , although Grinsted et al.  find a significant positive trend in eastern USA using tide-guage data from 1923-2008 as a proxy for storm surges associated with land-falling hurricanes. Differences between tropical cyclone studies highlight the challenges that still lie ahead in assessing long-term trends.	0
Arguably, storm frequency is of limited usefulness if not considered in tandem with intensity and duration measures. Intensity measures in historical records are especially sensitive to changing technology and improving methodology. However, over the satellite era, increases in the intensity of the strongest storms in the Atlantic appear robust  but there is limited evidence for other regions and the globe. Time series of cyclone indices such as power dissipation, an aggregate compound of tropical cyclone frequency, duration and intensity that measures total wind energy by tropical cyclones, show upward trends in the North Atlantic and weaker upward trends in the western North Pacific since the late 1970s , but interpretation of longer-term trends is again constrained by data quality concerns .	0
2009), with substantial decadal and longer fluctuations but with some regional and seasonal trends . Figure 2.35 shows some of these changes for boreal winter using geostrophic wind speeds indicating that decreasing trends outnumber increasing trends , although with few that are statistically significant. Although Donat et al.  and Wang et al.  find significant increases in both the strength and frequency of wintertime storms for large parts of Europe using the 20CR , there is debate over whether this is an artefact of the changing number of assimilated observations over time  even though Wang et al.  find good agreement between the 20CR trends and those derived from geostropic wind extremes in the North Sea region.	0
AR4 noted a likely net increase in frequency/intensity of NH extreme extratropical cyclones and a poleward shift in storm tracks since the 1950s. SREX further consolidated the AR4 assessment of poleward shifting storm tracks, but revised the assessment of the confidence levels associated with regional trends in the intensity of extreme extratropical cyclones. Studies using reanalyses continue to support a northward and eastward shift in the Atlantic cyclone activity during the last 60 years with both more frequent and more intense wintertime cyclones in the high-latitude Atlantic  and fewer in the mid-latitude Atlantic . Some studies show an increase in intensity and number of extreme Atlantic cyclones  while others show opposite trends in eastern Pacific and North America . Comparisons between studies are hampered because of the sensitivities in identification schemes and/ or different definitions for extreme cyclones . The fidelity of research findings also rests largely with the underlying reanalyses products that are used . See also Section 14.6.2. Over longer periods studies of severe storms or storminess have been performed for Europe where long running in situ pressure and wind observations exist. Direct wind speed measurements, however, either have short records or are hampered by inconsistencies due to changing instrumentation and observing practice over time . In most cases, therefore wind speed or storminess proxies are derived from in situ pressure measurements or reanalyses data, the quality and consistency of which vary. In situ observations indicate no clear trends over the past century or longer (Hanna et al., 2008; Matulla et al., 2008; Allan et al., 2009; Barring and Fortuniak,	0
Using the 20CR , Wang et al.  found substantial increases in extratropical cyclone activity in the SH . However, for southeast Australia, a decrease in activity is found and this agrees well with geostrophic wind extremes derived from in situ surface pressure observations . This strengthens the evidence of a southward shift in storm tracks previously noted using older reanalyses products . Frederiksen and Frederiksen  linked the reduction in cyclogenesis at 30S and southward shift to a decrease in the vertical mean meridional temperature gradient. There is some inconsistency among reanalysis products for the SH regarding trends in the frequency of intense extratropical cyclones  although studies tend to agree on a trend towards more intense systems, even when inhomogeneities associated with changing numbers of observations have been taken into account . However, further undetected contamination of these trends owing to issues with the reanalyses products cannot be ruled out  and this lowers our confidence in long-term trends. Links between extratropical cyclone activity and large-scale variability are discussed in Sections 2.7 and 14.6.2. 217	0
FAQ 2.2 | Have There Been Any Changes in Climate Extremes? There is strong evidence that warming has lead to changes in temperature extremes--including heat waves--since the mid-20th century. Increases in heavy precipitation have probably also occurred over this time, but vary by region. However, for other extremes, such as tropical cyclone frequency, we are less certain, except in some limited regions, that there have been discernable changes over the observed record. From heat waves to cold snaps or droughts to flooding rains, recording and analysing climate extremes poses unique challenges, not just because these events are rare, but also because they invariably happen in conjunction with disruptive conditions. Furthermore, there is no consistent definition in the scientific literature of what constitutes an extreme climatic event, and this complicates comparative global assessments. Although, in an absolute sense, an extreme climate event will vary from place to place--a hot day in the tropics, for instance, may be a different temperature to a hot day in the mid-latitudes--international efforts to monitor extremes have highlighted some significant global changes.	0
Warm spells or heat waves, that is, periods containing consecutive extremely hot days or nights, have also been assessed, but there are fewer studies of heat wave characteristics than those that compare changes in merely warm days or nights. Most global land areas with available data have experienced more heat waves since the middle of the 20th century. One exception is the south-eastern USA, where heat wave frequency and duration measures generally show decreases. This has been associated with a so-called `warming hole' in this region, where precipitation has also increased and may be related to interactions between the land and the atmosphere and long-term variations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, for large regions, particularly in Africa and South America, information on changes in heatwaves is limited.	0
For example, using consistent definitions for cold  and warm  days and nights it is found that warm days and nights have increased and cold days and nights have decreased for most regions of the globe; a few exceptions being central and eastern North America, and southern South America but mostly only related to daytime temperatures. Those changes are generally most apparent in minimum temperature extremes, for example, warm nights. Data limitations make it difficult to establish a causal link to increases in average temperatures, but FAQ 2.2, Figure 1 indicates that daily global temperature extremes have indeed changed. Whether these changes are simply associated with the average of daily temperatures increasing  or whether other changes in the distribution of daytime and nighttime temperatures have occurred is still under debate.	0
Changes in extremes for other climate variables are generally less coherent than those observed for temperature, owing to data limitations and inconsistencies between studies, regions and/or seasons. However, increases in precipitation extremes, for example, are consistent with a warmer climate. Analyses of land areas with sufficient data indicate increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events in recent decades, but results vary strongly between regions and seasons. For instance, evidence is most compelling for increases in heavy precipitation in North America, Central America and Europe, but in some other regions--such as southern Australia and western Asia--there is evidence of decreases. Likewise, drought studies do not agree on the sign of the global trend, with regional inconsistencies in trends also dependent on how droughts are defined. However, indications exist that droughts have increased in some regions  and decreased in others  since the middle of the 20th century. Considering other extremes, such as tropical cyclones, the latest assessments show that due to problems with past observing capabilities, it is difficult to make conclusive statements about long-term trends. There is very strong evidence, however, that storm activity has increased in the North Atlantic since the 1970s.	0
Over periods of a century or more, evidence suggests slight decreases in the frequency of tropical cyclones making landfall in the North Atlantic and the South Pacific, once uncertainties in observing methods have been considered. Little evidence exists of any longer-term trend in other ocean basins. For extratropical cyclones, a poleward shift is evident in both hemispheres over the past 50 years, with further but limited evidence of a decrease in wind storm frequency at mid-latitudes. Several studies suggest an increase in intensity, but data sampling issues hamper these assessments. FAQ 2.2, Figure 2 summarizes some of the observed changes in climate extremes. Overall, the most robust global changes in climate extremes are seen in measures of daily temperature, including to some extent, heat waves. Precipitation extremes also appear to be increasing, but there is large spatial variability, and observed trends in droughts are still uncertain except in a few regions. While robust increases have been seen in tropical cyclone frequency and activity in the North Atlantic since the 1970s, the reasons for this are still being debated. There is limited evidence of changes in extremes associated with other climate variables since the mid-20th century.	0
Box 2.4 | Extremes Indices As SREX highlighted, there is no unique definition of what constitutes a climate extreme in the scientific literature given variations in regions and sectors affected . Much of the available research is based on the use of so-called `extremes indices' . These indices can either be based on the probability of occurrence of given quantities or on absolute or percentage threshold exceedances  but also include more complex definitions related to duration, intensity and persistence of extreme events. For example, the term `heat wave' can mean very different things depending on the index formulation for the application for which it is required . Box 2.4, Table 1 lists a number of specific indices that appear widely in the literature and have been chosen to provide some consistency across multiple chapters in AR5 . These indices have been generally chosen for their robust statistical properties and their applicability across a wide range of climates. Another important criterion is that data for these indices are broadly available over both space and time. The existing near-global land-based data sets cover at least the post-1950 period but for regions such as Europe, North America, parts of Asia and Australia much longer analyses are available. The same indices used in observational studies  are also used to diagnose climate model output .	0
The types of indices discussed here do not include indices such as NINO3 representing positive and negative phases of ENSO , nor do they include extremes such as 1 in 100 year events. Typically extreme indices assessed here reflect more `moderate' extremes, for example, events occurring as often as 5% or 10% of the time . Predefined extreme indices are usually easier to obtain than the underlying daily climate data, which are not always freely exchanged by meteorological services. However, some of these indices do represent rarer events, for example, annual maxima or minima. Analyses of these and rarer extremes  Box 2.4, Table 1 | Definitions of extreme temperature and precipitation indices used in IPCC . The most common units are shown but these may be shown as normalized or relative depending on application in different chapters. Definition	0
Extreme indices are more generally defined for daily temperature and precipitation characteristics  although research is developing on the analysis of sub-daily events but mostly only on regional scales . Temperature and precipitation indices are sometimes combined to investigate `extremeness'  and/or the areal extent of extremes  and its variants . Indices rarely include other weather and climate variables, such as wind speed, humidity or physical impacts  and phenomena. Some examples are available in the literature for wind-based  and pressure-based  indices, for health-relevant indices combining temperature and relative humidity characteristics  and for a range of dryness or drought indices  Palmer, 1965; Standardised Precipitation Index , Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index  Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010) and wetness indices ; Vidal et al., 2010). 	0
In addition to the complication of defining an index, the results depend also on the way in which indices are calculated . This is due to the fact that different algorithms may be employed to create grid box averages from station data, or that extremes indices may be calculated from gridded daily data or at station locations and then gridded. All of these factors add uncertainty to the calculation of an extreme. For example, the spatial patterns of trends in the hottest day of the year differ slightly between data sets, although when globally averaged, trends are similar over the second half of the 20th century . Further discussion of the parametric and structural uncertainties in data sets is given in Box 2.1.	0

Changes in atmospheric circulation and indices of climate variability, as expressed in sea level pressure , wind, geopotential height , and other variables were assessed in AR4. Substantial multi-decadal variability was reported in the large-scale atmospheric circulation over the Atlantic and the Pacific. With respect to trends, a decrease was found in tropospheric GPH over high latitudes of both hemispheres and an increase over the mid-latitudes in boreal winter for the period 1979-2001. These changes were found to be associated with an intensification and poleward displacement of Atlantic and southern mid-latitude jet streams and enhanced storm track activity in the NH from the 1960s to at least the 1990s. Changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation  and the Southern Annular Mode  towards their positive phases were observed, but it was noted that the NAO returned to its long-term mean state from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s. Since AR4, more and improved observational data sets and reanalysis data sets  have been published. Uncertainties and inaccuracies in all data sets are better understood . The studies since AR4 assessed in this section support the poleward movement of circulation features since the 1970s and the change in the SAM. At the same time, large decadal-to-multidecadal variability in atmospheric circulation is found that partially offsets previous trends in other circulation features such as the NAO or the Pacific Walker circulation. This section assesses observational evidence for changes in atmospheric circulation in fields of SLP, GPH, and wind, in circulation features , as well as in circulation variability modes. Regional climate effects of the circulation changes are discussed in Chapter 14.	0
AR4 concluded that SLP in December to February decreased between 1948 and 2005 in the Arctic, Antarctic and North Pacific. More recent studies using updated data for the period 1949-2009  also find decreases in SLP in the high latitudes of both hemispheres in all seasons and increasing SLP in the tropics and subtropics most of the year. However, due to decadal variability SLP trends are sensitive to the choice of the time period , and they depend on the data set. The spatial distribution of SLP represents the distribution of atmospheric mass, which is the surface imprint of the atmospheric circulation. Barometric measurements are made in weather stations or on board ships. Fields are produced from the observations by interpolation or using data assimilation into weather models. One of the most widely used observational data sets is HadSLP2 , which integrates 2228 historical global terrestrial stations with marine observations from the ICOADS on a 5 x 5grid. Other observation products  or reanalyses are also widely used to address changes in SLP. Although the quality of SLP data is considered good, there are discrepancies between gridded SLP data sets in regions with sparse observations, e.g., over Antarctica . Van Haren et al.  found a strong SLP decrease over the Mediterranean in January to March from 1961 to 2000. For the more recent period  trends in SLP, consistent across different data sets , are negative in the tropical and northern subtropical Atlantic during most of the year as well as, in May to October, in northern Siberia. Positive trends are found yearround over the North and South Pacific and South Atlantic. Trends in	0
the equatorial Pacific zonal SLP gradient during the 20th century  are discussed in Section 2.7.5. The position and strength of semi-permanent pressure centres show no clear evidence for trends since 1951. However, prominent variability is found on decadal time scales . Consistent across different data sets, the Azores high and the Icelandic low in boreal winter, as captured by the high and low SLP contours, were both small in the 1960s and 1970s, large in the 1980s and 1990s, and again smaller in the 2000s. Favre and Gershunov  find an eastward shift of the Aleutian low from the mid-1970s to 2001, which persisted during the 2000s . The Siberian High exhibits pronounced decadal-to-multidecadal variability , with a recent  strengthening and northwestward expansion . In boreal summer, the Atlantic and Pacific high-pressure systems extended more westward in the 1960s and 1970s than later. On interannual time scales, variations in pressure centres are related to modes of climate variability. Trends in the indices that capture the strength of these modes are reported in Section 2.7.8, their characteristics and impacts are discussed in Chapter 14. In summary, sea level pressure has likely decreased from 1979 to 2012 over the tropical Atlantic and increased over large regions of the Pacific and South Atlantic, but trends are sensitive to the time period analysed owing to large decadal variability.	0
Marine surface winds are also measured from space using various microwave range instruments: scatterometers and synthetic aperture radars retrieve wind vectors, while altimeters and passive radiometers measure wind speed only . The latter type provides the longest continuous record, starting in July 1987. Satellite-based interpolated marine surface wind data sets use objective analysis methods to blend together data from different satellites and atmospheric reanalyses. The latter provide wind directions as in Blended Sea Winds , or background fields as in Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform winds  and OAFlux . CCMP uses additional dynamical constraints, in situ data and a recently homogenized data set of SSM/I observations , among other satellite sources.	0
Surface wind measurements over land and ocean are based on largely separate observing systems. Early marine observations were based on ship speed through the water or sails carried or on visual estimates of sea state converted to the wind speed using the Beaufort scale. Anemometer measurements were introduced starting in the 1950s. The transition from Beaufort to measured winds introduced a spurious trend, compounded by an increase in mean anemometer height over time . ICOADS release 2.5  contains information on measurement methods and wind measurement heights, permitting adjustment for these effects. The ICOADS-based data set WASWind  and the interpolated product NOCS v.2.0  include such corrections, among other improvements.	0
term climate change . Kent et al.  recently intercompared several of these data sets and found large differences. The differences in trend patterns in Figure 2.38 are large as well. Nevertheless, some statistically significant features are present in most data sets, including a pattern of positive and negative trend bands across the North Atlantic Ocean  and positive trends along the west coast of North America. Strengthening of the Southern Ocean winds, consistent with the increasing trend in the SAM  and with the observed changes in wind stress fields described in Section 3.4.4, can be seen in satellite-based analyses and atmospheric reanalyses in Figure 2.38. Alternating Southern Ocean trend signs in the NOCS v.2.0 panel are due to interpolation of very sparse in situ data .	0
used for trend analysis. Global data sets lack important meta information on instrumentation and siting . Long, homogenized instrumental records are rare . Moreover, wind speed trends are sensitive to the anemometer height . Winds near the surface can be derived from reanalysis products , but discrepancies are found when comparing trends therein with trends for land stations . Over land, a weakening of seasonal and annual mean as well as maximum winds is reported for many regions from around the 1960s or 1970s to the early 2000s ), including China and the Tibetan Plateau  , Western and southern Europe , much of the USA , Australia  and southern and western	0

Shown in the top row are data sets based on the satellite wind observations:  Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform wind product ;  wind speed from the Objectively Analyzed Air-Sea Heat Fluxes data set, release 3 ;  Blended Sea Winds ; in the middle row are data sets based on surface observations:  ERA-Interim;  NCEP-NCAR, v.1 ;  20th Century Reanalysis , and in the bottom row are surface wind speeds from atmospheric reanalyses:  wind speed from the Surface Flux Data set, v.2, from NOC, Southampton, UK ;  Wave- and Anemometer-based Sea Surface Wind ); and  Surface Winds on the Land . Wind speeds correspond to 10 m heights in all products. Land station winds  are also for 10 m  except for the Australian data where they correspond to 2 m height. To improve readability of plots, all data sets  were averaged to the 4 x 4 uniform longitude-latitude grid. Trends were computed for the annually averaged timeseries of 4 x 4 cells. For all data sets except land station data, an annual mean was considered available only if monthly means for no less than eight months were available in that calendar year. Trend values were computed only if no less than 17 years had values and at least 1 year was available among the first and last 3 years of the period. White areas indicate incomplete or missing data. Black plus signs  indicate grid boxes where trends are significant .	0
Canada . Increasing wind speeds were found at high latitudes in both hemispheres, namely in Alaska from 1921 to 2001 , in the central Canadian Arctic and Yukon from the 1950 to the 2000s  and in coastal Antarctica over the second half of the 20th century . A global review of 148 studies showed that near-surface terrestrial wind speeds are declining in the Tropics and the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres at a rate of -0.14 m s-1 per decade . Vautard et al. , analysing a global land surface wind data set from 1979 to 2008, found negative trends on the order of -0.1 m s-1 per decade over large portions of NH land areas. The wind speed trend pattern over land inferred from their data  has many points with magnitudes much larger than those in the reanalysis products, which appear to underestimate systematically the wind speed over land, as well as in coastal regions . In summary, confidence is low in changes in surface wind speed over the land and over the oceans owing to remaining uncertainties in data sets and measures used.	0
In contrast to surface winds, winds above the planetary boundary layer have received little attention in AR4. Radiosondes and pilot balloon observations are available from around the 1930s . Temporal inhomogeneities in radiosonde wind records are less common, but also less studied, than those in radiosonde temperature records . Upper air winds can also be derived from tracking clouds or water vapour in satellite imagery  or from measurements using wind profilers, aircraft or thermal observations, all of which serve as an input to reanalyses . In the past few years, interest in an accurate depiction of upper air winds has grown, as they are essential for estimating the state and changes of the general atmospheric circulation and for explaining changes in the surface winds . Allen and Sherwood , analysing wind shear from radiosonde data, found significant positive zonal mean zonal wind trends in the northern extratropics in the upper troposphere and stratosphere and negative trends in the tropical upper troposphere for the period 1979-2005. Vautard et al.  find increasing wind speed in radiosonde observations in the lower and middle troposphere from 1979 to 2008 over Europe and North America and decreasing wind speeds over Central and East Asia. However, systematic global trend analyses of radiosonde winds are rare, prohibiting an assessment of upper-air wind trends . In summary, upper-air winds are less studied than other aspects of the circulation, and less is known about the quality of data products, hence confidence in upper-air wind trends is low.	0
AR4 concluded that over the NH between 1960 and 2000, boreal winter and annual means of tropospheric GPH decreased over high latitudes and increased over the mid-latitudes. AR4 also reported an increase in tropical tropopause height and a slight cooling of the tropical cold-point tropopause. Changes in GPH, which can be addressed using radiosonde data or reanalysis data , reflect SLP and temperature changes in the atmospheric levels below. The spatial gradients of the trend indicate changes in the upper-level circulation. As for SLP, tropopsheric GPH trends strongly depend on the period analysed due to pronounced decadal variability. For the 1979-2012 period, trends for 500 hPa GPH from the ERA-Interim reanalysis  as well as for other reanalyses show a significant decrease only at southern high latitudes in November to April, but significant positive GPH trends in the subtropics and northern high latitudes. Hence the change in the time period leads to a different trend pattern as compared to AR4. The seasonality and spatial dependence of 500 hPa GPH trends over Antarctica was highlighted by Neff et al. , based upon radiosonde data over the period 1957-2007. Minimum temperatures near the tropical tropopause  are important as they affect the water vapour input into the stratosphere . Studies since AR4 confirm the increase in tropopause height . For tropical tropopause temperatures, studies based on radiosonde data and reanalyses partly support a cooling between the 1990s and the early 2000s , but uncertainties in long-term trends of the tropical cold-point tropopause temperature from radiosondes  and reanalyses  are large and confidence is therefore low. In summary, tropospheric geopotential height likely decreased from 1979 to 2012 at SH high latitudes in austral summer and increased in the subtropics and NH high latitudes. Confidence in trends of the tropical cold-point tropopause is low owing to remaining uncertainties in the data.	0
cycle . Changes in the monsoon systems are expressed through altered circulation, moisture transport and convergence, and precipitation. Only a few monsoon studies address circulation changes, while most work focuses on precipitation. Several studies report a weakening of the global monsoon circulations as well as a decrease of global land monsoon rainfall or of the number of precipitation days over the past 40 to 50 years . Concerning the East Asian Monsoon, a year-round decrease is reported for wind speeds over China at the surface and in the lower troposphere based on surface observations and radiosonde data . The changes in wind speed are concomitant with changes in pressure centres such as a westward extension of the Western Pacific Subtropical High .

Consistent changes in different observed variables suggest a weakening of the Pacific Walker circulation during much of the 20th century that has been largely offset by a recent strengthening. A weakening is indicated by trends in the zonal SLP gradient across the equatorial Pacific  from 1861 to 1992 , or from 1901 to 2004 . Boreal spring and summer contribute most strongly to the centennial trend , as well as to the trend in the second half of the 20th century . For boreal fall and winter, when the circulation is strongest, no trend is found in the Pacific Walker circulation based on the vertical velocity at 500 hPa from reanalyses , equatorial Pacific 10 m zonal winds, or SLP in Darwin . However, there are inconsistencies between ERA-40 and NNR . Deser et al.  find changes in marine air temperature and cloud cover over the Pacific that are consistent with a weakening of the Walker circulation during most of the 20th century . Tokinaga et al.  find robust evidence for a weakening of the Walker circulation  from 1950 to 2008 based on observations of cloud cover, surface wind, and SLP. Since the 1980s or 1990s, however, trends in the Pacific Walker	0

Caldeira, 2008a; Fu and Lin, 2011) but no clear trend is found in the SH . There is inconsistency with respect to jet speed trends based upon whether one uses an SMW-based or isobaric-based approach  and the choice of analysis periods due to inhomogeneities in reanalyses . In general, jets have become more common  over the western and central Pacific, eastern Canada, the North Atlantic and Europe , trends that are concomitant with regional increases in GPH gradients and circumpolar vortex contraction . From a climate dynamics perspective, these trends are driven by regional patterns of tropospheric and lower stratospheric warming or cooling and thus are coupled to large-scale circulation variability.	0
2.7.6.1 Mid-latitude and Subtropical Jets and Storm Track Position AR4 reported a poleward displacement of Atlantic and southern polar front jet streams from the 1960s to at least the mid-1990s and a poleward shift of the northern hemispheric storm tracks. However, it was also noted that uncertainties are large and that NNR and ERA-40 disagree in important aspects. SREX also reported a poleward shift of NH and SH storm tracks. Studies since AR4 confirm that in the NH, the jet core has been migrating towards the pole since the 1970s, but trends in the jet speed are uncertain. Additional studies assessed here further support the poleward shift of the North Atlantic storm track from the 1950s to the early 2000s. Subtropical and mid-latitude jet streams are three-dimensional entities that vary meridionally, zonally, and vertically. The position of the mid-latitude jet streams is related to the position of the mid-latitude storm tracks; regions of enhanced synoptic activity due to the passage of cyclones . Jet stream winds can be determined from radiosonde measurements of GPH using quasi-geostrophic flow assumptions. Using reanalysis data sets , it is possible to track three-dimensional jet variations by identifying a surface of maximum wind , although a high vertical resolution is required for identification of jets. Various new analyses based on NCEP/NCAR and ERA-40 reanalyses as well as MSU/AMSU lower stratospheric temperatures  confirm that the jet streams  have been moving poleward in most regions in the NH over the last three decades (Fu et al., 2006; Hu and Fu, 2007; Strong and Davis, 2007; Archer and	0
Changes in the frequency of weather types are of interest since weather extremes are often associated with specific weather types. For instance, persistent blocking of the westerly flow was essential in the development of the 2010 heat wave in Russia  . Synoptic classifications or statistical clustering  are commonly used to classify the weather on a given day. Feature-based methods are also used . All these methods require daily SLP or upper-level fields. Trends in synoptic weather types have been best analysed for central Europe since the mid-20th century, where several studies describe an increase in westerly or cyclonic weather types in winter but an increase of anticyclonic, dry weather types in summer . An eastward shift of blocking events over the North Atlantic  and the North Pacific was found by Davini et al.  using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis since 1951 and by Croci-Maspoli et al.  in ERA-40 reanalysis during the period 1957-2001. Mokhov et al.  find an increase in blocking duration over the NH year-round since about 1990 in a study based on NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data from 1969-2011. For the SH, Dong et al.  found a decrease in number of blocking days but increase in intensity of blocking over the period 1948-1999. Differences in blocking index definitions, the sensitivity of some indices to changes in the mean field, and strong interannual variability in all seasons , partly related to circulation variability modes , complicate a global assessment of blocking trends. 229	0
The most important characteristics of the stratospheric circulation for climate and for trace gas distribution are the winter and spring polar vortices and Sudden Stratospheric Warmings , the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation  and the Brewer-Dobson circulation . Radiosonde observations, reanalysis data sets and space-borne temperature or trace gas observations are used to address changes in the stratospheric circulation, but all of these sources of information carry large trend uncertainties. The AR4 assessment was corroborated further in Forster et al.  and in updated 100 hPa GPH trends from ERA-Interim reanalysis . There is high confidence that lower stratospheric GPH over Antarctica has decreased in spring and summer at least since 1979. Cohen et al.  reported an increase in the number of Arctic sudden stratospheric warmings during the last two decades. However, interannual variability in the Arctic Polar Vortex is large, uncertainties in reanalysis products are high , and trends depend strongly on the time period analysed . The BDC is only indirectly observable via wave activity diagnostics , via temperatures or via the distribution of trace gases which may allow the determination of the `age of air' . Randel et al. , found a sudden decrease in global lower stratospheric water vapour and ozone around 2001 that is consistent with an increase in the mean tropical upwelling, that is, the tropical branch of the BDC . On the other hand, Engel et al.  found no statistically significant change in the age of air in the 24-35 km layer over the NH mid-latitudes from measurements of chemically inert trace gases from 1975 to 2005. However, this does not rule out trends in the lower stratospheric branch of the BDC or trends in mid to low latitude mixing . All of these methods are subject to considerable uncertainties, and they might shed light only on some aspects of the BDC. Confidence in trends in the BDC is therefore low.	0
AR4 assessed changes in indices of climate variability. The NAO and SAM were found to exhibit positive trends  from the 1960s to 1990s, but the NAO has returned to its long-term mean state since then. Indices of climate variability describe the state of the climate system with regards to individual modes of climate variability. Together with corresponding spatial patterns, they summarize large fractions of spatio-temporal climate variability. Inferences about significant trends in indices are generally hampered by relative shortness of climate records, their uncertainties and the presence of large variability on decadal and multidecadal time scales. Table 2.14 summarizes observed changes in well-known indices of climate variability . Even the indices that explicitly include detrending of the entire record , can exhibit statistically significant trends over shorter sub-periods. Confidence intervals in Table 2.14 that do not contain zero indicate trend significance at 10% level; however, the trends significant at 5% and 1% levels are emphasized in the discussion that follows. Chapter 14 discusses the main features and physical meaning of individual climate modes. The NAO index reached very low values in the winter of 2010 . As a result, with the exception of the principal component  -based NAO index, which still shows a 5% significant positive trend from 1951 to present, other NAO or North Annular Mode  indices do not show significant trends of either sign for the periods presented in Table 2.14. In contrast, the SAM maintained the upward trend . Fogt et al.  found a positive trend in the SAM index from 1957 to 2005. Visbeck , in a station-based index, found an increase in recent decades . The observed detrended multidecadal SST anomaly averaged over the North Atlantic Ocean area is often called Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation Index . The warming trend in the "revised" AMO index since 1979 is significant at 1% level  but cannot be readily interpreted because of the difficulty with reliable removal of the SST warming trend from it . On decadal and inter-decadal time scales the Pacific climate shows an irregular oscillation with long periods of persistence in individual stages and prominent shifts between them. Pacific Decadal Oscillation , Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation  and North Pacific Index  indices characterize this variability for both hemispheres and agree well with each other . While AR4 noted climate impacts of the 1976-1977 PDO phase transition, the shift in the opposite direction, both in PDO and IPO, may have occurred at the end of 1990s . Significance of 1979-2012 trends in PDO and NPI then would be an artefact of this	0
Table 2.14 | Trends for selected indices listed in Box 2.5, Table 1. Each index was standardized for its longest available period contained within the 1870-2012 interval. Standardization was done on the December-to-March  means for the NAO, NAM and Pacific-North American pattern , on seasonal anomalies for Pacific-South American patterns  and on monthly anomalies for all other indices. Standardized monthly and seasonal anomalies were further averaged to annual means. Trend values computed for annual or DJFM means are given in standard deviation per decade with their 90% confidence intervals. Index records where the source is not explicitly indicated were computed from either HadISST1 , or HadSLP2r  or NNR fields of 500 hPa or 850 hPa geopotential height. CoA stands for `Centers of Action' index definitions. Linear trends for 1870-2012 were removed from ATL3, BMI and DMI.	0
NINO3.4 and NINO3 show a century-scale warming trend significant at 5% level, if computed from the ERSSTv3b data set  but not if calculated from other data sets . Furthermore, the sign  of the trend in east-west SST gradient across the Pacific remains ambiguous  . In addition to changes in the mean values of climate indices, changes in the associated spatial patterns are also possible. In particular, the diversity of detail of different ENSO events and possible distinction between their "flavors" have received significant attention . These efforts also intensified the discussion of useful ENSO indices in the literature. Starting from the work of Trenberth and Stepaniak , who proposed to characterize the evolution of ENSO events with the Trans-Nino Index , which is virtually uncorrelated with the standard ENSO index NINO3.4, other alternative ENSO indices have been introduced and proposals were made for classifying ENSO events according to the indices they primarily maximize. While a traditional, `canonical' El Nino event type  is viewed as the `eastern Pacific' type, some of the alternative indices purport to identify events that have central Pacific maxima and are called dateline El Nino , Modoki , or Central Pacific El Nino . However, no consensus has been reached regarding the appropriate classification	0
of ENSO events. Takahashi et al.  and Ren and Jin  have presented many of the popular ENSO indices as elements in a two-dimensional linear space spanned by a pair of such indices. ENSO indices that involve central and western Pacific SST  show no significant trends. Significant positive PNA trends and negative and positive trends in the first and second PSA modes respectively are observed over the last 60 years . However, the level of significance of these trends depends on the index definition and on the data set used. The positive trend in the Atlantic Ocean `Nino' mode  index and in ATL3 are due to the intensified warming in the eastern Tropical Atlantic that causes the the weakening of the Atlantic equatorial cold tongue: these changes were noticed by Tokinaga and Xie  with regards to the last 60-year period. The Indian Ocean Basin Mode  has a strong warming trend . This phenomenon is well-known  and its consequences for the regional climate is a subject of active research . In summary, large variability on interannual to decadal time scales and remaining differences between data sets precludes robust conclusions on long-term changes in indices of climate variability. Confidence is high that the increase in the NAO index from the 1950s to the 1990s has been largely offset by recent changes. It is likely that the SAM index has become more positive since the 1950s.	0
Box 2.5 | Patterns and Indices of Climate Variability Much of the spatial structure of climate variability can be described as a combination of `preferred' patterns. The most prominent of these are known as modes of climate variability and they impact weather and climate on many spatial and temporal scales . Individual climate modes historically have been identified through spatial teleconnections: correlations between regional climate variations at widely separated, geographically fixed spatial locations. An index describing temporal variations of the climate mode in question can be formed, for example, by adding climate anomalies calculated from meteorological records at stations exhibiting the strongest correlation with the mode and subtracting anomalies at stations exhibiting anticorrelation. By regressing climate records from other places on this index, one derives a spatial climate pattern characterizing this mode. Patterns of climate variability have also been derived using a variety of mathematical techniques such as principal component analysis . These patterns and their indices are useful both because they efficiently describe climate variability in terms of a few preferred modes and also because they can provide clues about how the variablility is sustained . Box 2.5, Table 1 lists some prominent modes of large-scale climate variability and indices used for defining them. Changes in these indices are associated with large-scale climate variations on interannual and longer time scales. With some exceptions, indices shown have been used by a variety of authors. They are defined relatively simply from raw or statistically analyzed observations of a single climate variable, which has a history of surface observations. For most of these indices at least a century-long record is available for climate research.  232	0

Data set references given in the panel titles apply to all indices shown in that panel. Where no data set is specified, a publicly available version of an index from the authors of a primary reference given in Box 2.5, Table 1 was used.

All patterns are shown by color plots, except for PSA2, which is shown by white contours over the PSA1 color plot .	0
Changes in Water Masses and Circulation Observed changes in water mass properties likely reflect the combined effect of long-term trends in surface forcing  and interannual-to-multi-decadal variability related to climate modes. Most of the observed temperature and salinity changes in the ocean interior can be explained by subduction and spreading of water masses with properties that have been modified at the sea surface. From 1950 to 2000, it is likely that subtropical salinity maximum waters became more saline, while fresh intermediate waters formed at higher latitude have generally become fresher. For Upper North Atlantic Deep Water changes in properties and formation rates are very likely dominated by decadal variability. The Lower North Atlantic Deep Water has likely cooled from 1955 to 2005, and the freshening trend highlighted in AR4 reversed in the mid-1990s. It is likely that the Antarctic Bottom Water warmed and contracted globally since the 1980s and freshened in the Indian/Pacific sectors from 1970 to 2008. Recent observations have strengthened evidence for variability in major ocean circulation systems on time scales from years to decades. It is very likely that the subtropical gyres in the North Pacific and South Pacific have expanded and strengthened since 1993. It is about as likely as not that this is linked to decadal variability in wind forcing rather than being part of a longer-term trend. Based on measurements of the full Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and its individual components at various latitudes and different time periods, there is no evidence of a long-term trend. There is also no evidence for trends in the transports of the Indonesian Throughflow, the Antarctic	0
Sea Level Change Global mean sea level  has risen by 0.19  m over the period 1901-2010, calculated using the mean rate over these 110 years, based on tide gauge records and since 1993 additionally on satellite data. It is very likely that the mean rate was 1.7  mm yr-1 between 1901 and 2010 and increased to 3.2  mm yr-1 between 1993 and 2010. This assessment is based on high agreement among multiple studies using different methods, long tide gauge records corrected for vertical land motion and independent observing systems  since 1993 . It is likely that GMSL rose between 1920 and 1950 at a rate comparable to that observed between 1993 and 2010, as individual tide gauges around the world and reconstructions of GMSL show increased rates of sea level rise during this period. Rates of sea level rise over broad regions can be several times larger or smaller than that of GMSL for periods of several decades due to fluctuations in ocean circulation. High agreement between studies with and without corrections for vertical land motion suggests that it is very unlikely that estimates of the global average rate of sea level change are significantly biased owing to vertical land motion that has been unaccounted for. 	0
The ocean influences climate by storing and transporting large amounts of heat, freshwater, and carbon, and by exchanging these properties with the atmosphere. About 93% of the excess heat energy stored by the Earth over the last 50 years is found in the ocean . The ability of the ocean to store vast amounts of heat reflects the large mass and heat capacity of seawater relative to air and the fact that ocean circulation connects the surface and interior ocean. More than three quarters of the total exchange of water between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface through evaporation and precipitation takes place over the oceans . The ocean contains 50 times more carbon than the atmosphere  and is at present acting to slow the rate of climate change by absorbing about 30% of human emissions of carbon dioxide  from fossil fuel burning, cement production, deforestation and other land use change . Changes in the ocean may result in climate feedbacks that either increase or reduce the rate of climate change. Climate variability and change on time scales from seasons to millennia is therefore closely linked to the ocean and its interactions with the atmosphere and cryosphere. The large inertia of the oceans means that they naturally integrate over short-term variability and often provide a clearer signal of longer-term change than other components of the climate system. Observations of ocean change therefore provide a means to track the evolution of climate change, and a relevant benchmark for climate models. The lack of long-term measurements of the global ocean and changes in the observing system over time makes documenting and understanding change in the oceans a difficult challenge . Many of the issues raised in Box 2.1 regarding uncertainty in atmospheric climate records are common to oceanographic data. Despite the limitations of historical records, AR4 identified significant trends in a number of ocean variables relevant to climate change, including ocean heat content, sea level, regional patterns of salinity, and biogeochemical parameters . Since AR4, substantial progress has been made in improving the quality and coverage of ocean observations. Biases in historical measurements have been identified and reduced, providing a clearer record of past change. The Argo array of profiling floats has provided near-global, year-round measurements of temperature and salinity in the upper 2000 m since 2005. The satellite altimetry record is now more than 20 years in length. Longer continuous time series of important components of the meridional overturning circulation and tropical oceans have been obtained. The spatial and temporal coverage of biogeochemical measurements in the ocean has expanded. As a result of these advances, there is now stronger evidence of change in the ocean, and our understanding of the causes of ocean change is improved. This chapter summarizes the observational evidence of change in the ocean, with an emphasis on basin- and global-scale changes relevant to climate, with a focus on studies published since the AR4. As in Chapter 2, the robustness of observed changes is assessed relative to sources of observational uncertainty. The attribution of ocean change, including the degree to which observed changes are consistent with anthropogenic climate change, is addressed in Chapter 10. The evidence for changes in subsurface ocean temperature and heat content is assessed 260	0
in Section 3.2; changes in sea surface temperature  are covered in Chapter 2. Changes in ocean heat content dominate changes in the global energy inventory . Recent studies have strengthened the evidence for regional changes in ocean salinity and their link to changes in evaporation and precipitation over the oceans , a connection already identified in AR4. Evidence for changes in the fluxes of heat, water and momentum  across the air-sea interface is assessed in Section 3.4. Considering ocean changes from a water-mass perspective adds additional insight into the nature and causes of ocean change . Although direct observations of ocean circulation are more limited than those of temperature and salinity, there is growing evidence of variability and change of ocean current patterns relevant to climate . Observations of sea level change are summarized in Section 3.7; Chapter 13 builds on the evidence presented in this and other chapters to provide an overall synthesis of past and future sea level change. Biogeochemical changes in the ocean, including ocean acidification, are covered in Section 3.8. Chapter 6 combines observations with models to discuss past and present changes in the carbon cycle. Section 3.9 provides an overall synthesis of changes observed in the ocean during the instrumental period and highlights key uncertainties. Unless otherwise noted, uncertainties  represent 5 to 95% confidence intervals.	0
Temperature is the most often measured subsurface ocean variable. Historically, a variety of instruments have been used to measure temperature, with differing accuracies, precisions, and sampling depths. Both the mix of instruments and the overall sampling patterns have changed in time and space , complicating efforts to determine and interpret long-term change. The evolution of the observing system for ocean temperature is summarized in Appendix 3.A. Upper ocean temperature  varies over multiple time scales including seasonal , interannual , decadal , and centennial . Ocean data assimilation products using these data exhibit similar significant variations . Sparse historical sampling coupled with large amplitude variations on shorter time and spatial scales raise challenges for estimating globally averaged upper ocean temperature changes. Uncertainty analyses indicate that the historical data set begins to be reasonably well suited for this purpose starting around 1970 . UOHC uncertainty estimates shrink after 1970 with improved sampling, so this assessment focuses on changes since 1971. Estimates of UOHC have been extended back to 1950 by averaging over longer time intervals, such as 5-year running means, to compensate for sparse data distributions in earlier time periods . These estimates may be most appropriate in the deeper ocean, where strong interannual variability in upper ocean temperature distributions such as that associated with El Nino  is less likely to be aliased.	0
Depth-averaged 0 to 700 m ocean temperature trends from 1971 to 2010 are positive over most of the globe . The warming is more prominent in the Northern Hemisphere , especially the North Atlantic. This result holds in different analyses, using different time periods, bias corrections and data sources  . However, the greater volume of the SH oceans increases the contribution of their warming to global heat content. Zonally averaged upper ocean temperature trends show warming at nearly all latitudes and depths . A maximum in warming south of 30S appears in Figure 3.1b, but is not as strong as in other analyses , likely because the data are relatively sparse in this location so anomalies are attenuated by the objectively analyzed fields	0
Recent estimates of upper ocean temperature change also differ in their treatment of unsampled regions. Some studies  effectively assume a temperature anomaly of zero in these regions, while other studies  assume that the averages of sampled regions are representative of the global mean in any given year, and yet others  use ocean statistics  to extrapolate temperature anomalies in sparsely sampled areas and estimate uncertainties. These differences in approach, coupled with choice of background climatology, can lead to significant divergence in basin-scale averages , especially in sparsely sampled regions  prior to Argo), and as a result can produce different global averages . However, for well-sampled regions and times, the various analyses of temperature changes yield results in closer agreement, as do reanalyses .	0
used for Figure 3.1 and because warming in the upper 1000 m of the Southern Ocean was stronger between the 1930s and the 1970s than between the 1970s and 1990s . Another warming maximum is present at 25N to 65N. Both warming signals extend to 700 m , and are consistent with poleward displacement of the mean temperature field. Other zonally averaged temperature changes are also consistent with poleward displacement of the mean temperatures. For example, cooling at depth between 30S and the equator  is consistent with a southward shift of cooler water near the equator. Poleward displacements of some subtropical and subpolar zonal currents and associated wind changes are discussed in Section 3.6.	0
Since AR4 the significant impact of measurement biases in some of the widely used instruments  and mechanical bathythermograph  as well as a subset of Argo floats) on estimates of ocean temperature and upper  ocean heat content  changes has been recognized . Careful comparison of measurements from the less accurate instruments with those from the more accurate ones has allowed some of the biases to be identified and reduced . One major consequence of this bias reduction has been the reduction of an artificial decadal variation in upper ocean heat content that was apparent in the observational assessment for AR4, in notable contrast to climate model output . Substantial time-dependent XBT and MBT biases introduced spurious warming in the 1970s and cooling in the early 1980s in the analyses assessed in AR4. Most ocean state estimates that assimilate biased data  also showed this artificial decadal variability while one  apparently rejected these data on dynamical grounds. More recent estimates assimilating better-corrected data sets  also result in reduced artificial decadal variability during this time period.	0
A potentially important impact of ocean warming is the effect on sea ice, floating glacial ice and ice sheet dynamics . Although some of the global integrals of UOHC neglect changes poleward of 60  or 65  latitude, at least some parts of the Arctic have warmed: In the Arctic Ocean, subsurface pulses of relatively warm water of Atlantic origin can be traced around the Eurasian Basin, and analyses of data from 1950-2010 show a decadal warming of this water mass since the late 1970s , as well as a shoaling, by 75 to 90 m . Arctic surface waters have also warmed, at least in the Canada Basin, from 1993 to 2007 .	0
sea surface, and the near-surface trends are consistent with independently measured SST . The global average warming over this period is 0.11  C per decade in the upper 75 m, decreasing to 0.015C per decade by 700 m . Comparison of Argo data to Challenger expedition data from the 1870s suggests that warming started earlier than 1971, and was also larger in the Atlantic than in the Pacific over that longer time interval . An observational analysis of temperature in the upper 400 m of the global ocean starting in the year 1900  finds warming between about 1900 and 1945, as well as after 1970, with some evidence of slight cooling between 1945 and 1970.	0

Global integrals of 0 to 700 m UOHC  estimated from ocean temperature measurements all show a gain from 1971 to 2010  . These estimates usually start around 1950, although as noted in Section 3.2.1 and discussed in the Appendix, historical data coverage is sparse, so global integrals are increasingly uncertain for earlier years, especially prior to 1970. There is some convergence towards agreement in instrument bias correction algorithms since AR4 , but other sources of uncertainty include the different assumptions regarding mapping and integrating UOHCs in sparsely sampled regions, differences in quality control of temperature data, and differences among baseline climatologies used for estimating changes in heat content . Although there are still apparent interannual variations about the upward trend of global UOHC since 1970, different global estimates have variations at different times and for different periods, suggesting that sub-decadal variability in the time rate of change is still quite uncertain in the historical record. Most of the estimates in Figure 3.2a do exhibit decreases for a few years immediately following major volcanic eruptions in 1963, 1982 and 1991 .	0
the heating rate required to account for this warming: 118  TW  for Levitus et al. , 98  TW for Ishii and Kimoto , 137  TW for Domingues et al. , 108  TW for Palmer et al. , and 74  TW for Smith and Murphy . Uncertainties are calculated as 90% confidence intervals for an ordinary least squares fit, taking into account the reduction in the degrees of freedom implied by the temporal correlation of the residuals. Although these rates of energy gain do not all agree within their statistical uncertainties, all are positive, and all are statistically different from zero. Generally the smaller trends are for estimates that assume zero anomalies in areas of sparse data, as expected for that choice, which will tend to reduce trends and variability. Hence the assessment of the Earth's energy uptake  employs a global UOHC estimate  chosen because it fills in sparsely sampled areas and estimates uncertainties using a statistical analysis of ocean variability patterns.	0
Below 700 m data coverage is too sparse to produce annual global ocean heat content estimates prior to about 2005, but from 2005 to 2010 and 0 to 1500 m the global ocean warmed . Five-year running mean estimates yield a 700 to 2000 m global ocean heat content trend from 1957 to 2009  that is about 30% of that for 0 to 2000 m over the length of the record . Ocean heat uptake from 700 to 2000 m likely continues unabated since 2003 ; as a result, ocean heat content from 0 to 2000 m shows less slowing after 2003 than does 0 to 700 m heat content . Global sampling of the ocean below 2000 m is limited to a number of repeat oceanographic transects, many occupied only in the last few decades , and several time-series stations, some of which extend over decades. This sparse sampling in space and time makes assessment of global deep ocean heat content variability less certain than that for the upper ocean , especially at middepths, where vertical gradients are still sufficiently large for transient variations  to alias estimates made from sparse data sets. However, the deep North Atlantic Ocean is better sampled than the rest of the globe, making estimates of full-depth deep ocean heat content changes there feasible north of 20N since the mid-1950s . Based on the limited information available, it is likely that the global ocean did not show a significant temperature trend between 2000 and 3000 m depth from about 1992-2005 . At these depths it has been around a millennium on average since waters in the Indian and Pacific Oceans were last exposed to air-sea interaction . Warming from 1992 to 2005 is likely greater than zero from 3000 m to the ocean floor , especially in recently formed Antarctic Bottom Water . South of the Sub-Antarctic Front , much of the water column warmed between 1992 and 2005 . Globally, deep warming rates are highest near 4500 m , usually near the sea floor where the AABW influence is strongest, and attenuate towards the north , where the AABW influence weakens. Global scale abyssal warming on relatively short multi-decadal time scales is possible because of communication of signals by planetary waves originating within the Southern Ocean, reaching even such remote regions as the North Pacific . This AABW warming may partly reflect a recovery from cool conditions induced by the 1970s Weddell Sea Polynya , but further north, in the Vema Channel of the South Atlantic, observations since 1970 suggest strong bottom water warming did not commence there until about 1991 .	0
In the North Atlantic, strong decadal variability in North Atlantic Deep Water  temperature and salinity , largely associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation  , complicates efforts to determine long-term trends from the historical record. Heat content in the North Atlantic north of 20N from 2000 m to the ocean floor increased slightly from 1955 to 1975, and then decreased more strongly from 1975 to 2005 , with a net cooling trend of -4 TW from 1955-2005 estimated from a linear fit. The global trend estimate below 2000 m is +35 TW from 1992 to 2005 , with strong warming in the Southern Ocean.	0
It is virtually certain that the upper ocean  warmed from 1971 to 2010. This result is supported by three independent and consistent methods of observation including  multiple analyses of subsurface temperature measurements described here;  SST data  from satellites and in situ measurements from surface drifters and ships; and  the record of sea level rise, which is known to include a substantial component owing to thermosteric expansion . The warming rate is 0.11 C per decade in the upper 75 m, decreasing to about 0.015C per decade by 700 m. It is very likely that surface intensification of the warming 263	0
Box 3.1 | Change in Global Energy Inventory The Earth has been in radiative imbalance, with less energy exiting the top of the atmosphere than entering, since at least about 1970 . Quantifying this energy gain is essential for understanding the response of the climate system to radiative forcing. Small amounts of this excess energy warm the atmosphere and continents, evaporate water and melt ice, but the bulk of it warms the ocean . The ocean dominates the change in energy because of its large mass and high heat capacity compared to the atmosphere. In addition, the ocean has a very low albedo and absorbs solar radiation much more readily than ice. The global atmospheric energy change inventory accounting for specific heating and water evaporation is estimated by combining satellite estimates for temperature anomalies in the lower troposphere  from 70S to 82.5N and the lower stratosphere  from 82.5S to 82.5N weighted by the ratio of the portions of atmospheric mass they sample . These temperature anomalies are converted to energy changes using a total atmospheric mass of 5.14 x 1018 kg, a mean total water vapor mass of 12.7 x 1015 kg , a heat capacity of 1 J g-1 C-1, a latent heat of vaporization of 2.464 J kg-1 and a fractional increase of integrated water vapor content of 0.075 C-1 . Smaller changes in potential and kinetic energy are considered negligible. Standard 300 deviations for each year of data are used for uncertainties, and Upper ocean Deep ocean the time series starts in 1979. The warming trend from a linear fit Ice from 1979 to 2010 amounts to 2 TW . 250	0
All annual ice melt rates  are converted into energy change using a heat of fusion  and density  for freshwater ice. The heat of fusion and density of ice may vary, but only slightly among the different ice types, and warming the ice from sub-freezing temperatures requires much less energy than that to melt it, so these second-order contributions are neglected here. The linear trend of energy storage from 1971 to 2010 is 7 TW. For the oceans, an estimate of global upper  ocean heat content change using ocean statistics to extrapolate to sparsely sampled regions and estimate uncertainties  is used , with a linear trend from 1971 to 2010 of 137 TW. For the ocean from 700 to 2000 m, annual 5-year running mean estimates are used from 1970 to 2009 and annual estimates for 2010-2011 . For the ocean from 2000 m to bottom, a uniform rate of energy gain of 35  TW from warming rates centred on 1992-2005  is applied from 1992 to 2011, with no warming below 2000 m assumed prior to 1992. Their 5 to 95% uncertainty estimate may be too small, as it 	0
assumes the usually sparse sampling in each deep ocean basin analysed is representative of the mean trend in that basin. The linear trend for heating the ocean below 700 m is 62 TW for 1971-2010. It is virtually certain that the Earth has gained substantial energy from 1971 to 2010 -- the estimated increase in energy inventory between 1971 and 2010 is 274  ZJ , with a rate of 213 TW from a linear fit to the annual values over that time period . An energy gain of 274 ZJ is equivalent to a heating rate of 0.42 W m-2 applied continuously over the surface area of the earth . Ocean warming dominates the total energy change inventory, accounting for roughly 93% on average from 1971 to 2010 . The upper ocean  accounts for about 64% of the total energy change inventory. Melting ice  accounts for 3% of the total, and warming of the continents 3%. Warming of the atmosphere makes up the remaining 1%. The 1971-2010 estimated rate of oceanic energy gain is 199 TW from a linear fit to data over that time period, implying a mean heat flux of 0.55 W m-2 across the global ocean surface area . The Earth's net estimated energy increase from 1993 to 2010 is 163  ZJ with a trend estimate of 275 TW. The ocean portion of the trend for 1993-2010 is 257 TW, equivalent to a mean heat flux into the ocean of 0.71 W m-2 over the global ocean surface area.	0
signal increased the thermal stratification of the upper ocean by about 4%  from 1971 to 2010. It is also likely that the upper ocean warmed over the first half of the 20th century, based again on these same three independent and consistent, although much sparser, observations. Deeper in the ocean, it is likely that the waters from 700 to 2000 m have warmed on average between 1957 and 2009 and likely that no significant trend was observed between 2000 and 3000 m from 1992 to 2005. It is very likely that the deep  North Atlantic Ocean north of 20N warmed from 1955 to 1975, and then cooled from 1975 to 2005, with an overall cooling trend. It is likely that most of the water column south of the Sub-Antarctic Front warmed at a rate of about 0.03C per decade from 1992 to 2005, and waters of Antarctic origin warmed below 3000 m at a global average rate approaching 0.01C per decade at 4500 m over the same time period. For the deep ocean. Sparse sampling is the largest source of uncertainty below 2000 m depth.	0
The ocean plays a pivotal role in the global water cycle: about 85% of the evaporation and 77% of the precipitation occurs over the ocean . The horizontal salinity distribution of the upper ocean largely reflects this exchange of freshwater, with high surface salinity generally found in regions where evaporation exceeds precipitation, and low salinity found in regions of excess precipitation and runoff . Ocean circulation also affects the regional distribution of surface salinity. The subduction  of surface waters transfers the surface salinity signal into the ocean interior, so that subsurface salinity distributions are also linked to patterns of evaporation, precipitation and continental run-off at the sea surface. Melting and freezing of ice  also influence ocean salinity.	0
has increased since the 1970s, at a rate consistent with the observed warming . It has not been possible to detect robust trends in regional precipitation and evaporation over the ocean because observations over the ocean are sparse and uncertain . Ocean salinity, on the other hand, naturally integrates the small difference between these two terms and has the potential to act as a rain gauge for precipitation minus evaporation over the ocean . Diagnosis and understanding of ocean salinity trends is also important because salinity changes, like temperature changes, affect circulation and stratification, and therefore the ocean's capacity to store heat and carbon as well as to change biological productivity. Salinity changes also contribute to regional sea level change . In AR4, surface and subsurface salinity changes consistent with a warmer climate were highlighted, based on linear trends for the period between 1955 and 1998 in the historical global salinity data set  as well as on more regional studies. In the early few decades the salinity data distribution was good in the NH, especially the North Atlantic, but the coverage was poor in some regions such as the central South Pacific, central Indian and polar oceans . However, Argo provides much more even spatial and temporal coverage in the 2000s. These additional observations, improvements in the availability and quality of historical data and new analysis approaches now allow a more complete assessment of changes in salinity. `Salinity' refers to the weight of dissolved salts in a kilogram of seawater. Because the total amount of salt in the ocean does not change, the salinity of seawater can be changed only by addition or removal of fresh water. All salinity values quoted in the chapter are expressed on the Practical Salinity Scale 1978  .	0
FAQ 3.1 | Is the Ocean Warming? Yes, the ocean is warming over many regions, depth ranges and time periods, although neither everywhere nor constantly. The signature of warming emerges most clearly when considering global, or even ocean basin, averages over time spans of a decade or more. Ocean temperature at any given location can vary greatly with the seasons. It can also fluctuate substantially from year to year--or even decade to decade--because of variations in ocean currents and the exchange of heat between ocean and atmosphere. Ocean temperatures have been recorded for centuries, but it was not until around 1971 that measurements were sufficiently comprehensive to estimate the average global temperature of the upper several hundred meters of the ocean confidently for any given year. In fact, before the international Argo temperature/salinity profiling float array first achieved worldwide coverage in 2005, the global average upper ocean temperature for any given year was sensitive to the methodology used to estimate it. Global mean upper ocean temperatures have increased over decadal time scales from 1971 to 2010. Despite large uncertainty in most yearly means, this warming is a robust result. In the upper 75 m of the ocean, the global average warming trend has been 0.11 C per decade over this time. That trend generally lessens from the surface to mid-depth, reducing to about 0.04C per decade by 200 m, and to less than 0.02C per decade by 500 m. Temperature anomalies enter the subsurface ocean by paths in addition to mixing from above . Colder--hence denser--waters from high latitudes can sink from the surface, then spread toward the equator beneath warmer, lighter, waters at lower latitudes. At a few locations--the northern North Atlantic Ocean and the Southern Ocean around Antarctica--ocean water is cooled so much that it sinks to great depths, even to the sea floor. This water then spreads out to fill much of the rest of the deep ocean. As ocean surface waters warm, these sinking waters also warm with time, increasing temperatures in the ocean interior much more quickly than would downward mixing of surface heating alone.	0
In the North Atlantic, the temperature of these deep waters varies from decade to decade--sometimes warming, sometimes cooling--depending on prevailing winter atmospheric patterns. Around Antarctica, bottom waters have warmed detectably from about 1992-2005, perhaps due to the strengthening and southward shift of westerly winds around the Southern Ocean over the last several decades. This warming signal in the deepest coldest bottom waters of the world ocean is detectable, although it weakens northward in the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Deep warming rates are generally less pronounced than ocean surface rates . However, they occur over a large volume, so deep ocean warming contributes significantly to the total increase in ocean heat. Estimates of historical changes in global average ocean temperature have become more accurate over the past several years, largely thanks to the recognition, and reduction, of systematic measurement errors. By carefully comparing less accurate measurements with sparser, more accurate ones at adjacent locations and similar times, scientists have reduced some spurious instrumental biases in the historical record. These improvements revealed that the global average ocean temperature has increased much more steadily from year to year than was reported prior to 2008. Nevertheless, the global average warming rate may not be uniform in time. In some years, the ocean appears to warm faster than average; in others, the warming rate seems to slow. The ocean's large mass and high heat capacity allow it to store huge amounts of energy--more than 1000 times that in the atmosphere for an equivalent increase in temperature. The Earth is absorbing more heat than it is emitting back into space, and nearly all this excess heat is entering the oceans and being stored there. The ocean has absorbed about 93% of the combined heat stored by warmed air, sea, and land, and melted ice between 1971 and 2010. The ocean's huge heat capacity and slow circulation lend it significant thermal inertia. It takes about a decade for near-surface ocean temperatures to adjust in response to climate forcing , such as changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. Thus, if greenhouse gas concentrations could be held at present levels into the future, increases in the Earth's surface temperature would begin to slow within about a decade. However, deep ocean temperature would continue to warm for centuries to millennia , and thus sea levels would continue to rise for centuries to millennia as well .  266	0
FAQ 3.1, Figure 1 | Ocean heat uptake pathways. The ocean is stratified, with the coldest, densest water in the deep ocean .

d ominates . For example, salinity generally increased in the surface salinity maxima formed in the evaporation-dominated subtropical gyres. The surface salinity minima at subpolar latitudes and the intertropical convergence zones have generally freshened. Interbasin salinity differences are also enhanced: the relatively salty Atlantic has become more saline on average, while the relatively fresh Pacific has become fresher . No well-defined trend is found in the subpolar North Atlantic , which is dominated by decadal variability from atmospheric modes like the North Atlantic Oscillation . The 50-year salinity trends in Figure 3.4c, both positive and negative, are statistically significant at the 99% level over 43.8% of the global ocean surface ; trends were less significant over the remainder of the surface.

It is very likely that the globally averaged contrast between regions of high and low salinity relative to the global mean salinity has increased.

Freshwater content in the upper 500 m very likely changed, based on the World Ocean Database 2009 , analyzed by Durack and Wijffels  and independently as an update to Boyer et al.  for 1955-2010 . Both show freshening in the North Pacific, salinification in the North Atlantic south of 50N and salinification in the northern Indian Ocean . A significant freshening is observed in the circumpolar Southern Ocean south of 50S. Density layers that are ventilated  in precipitation-dominated regions have freshened, while those ventilated in evaporation-dominated regions have increased in salinity, compatible with an enhancement of the mean surface freshwater flux pattern . In addition, where warming has caused surface outcrops of density layers to move  into higher salinity surface waters, the subducted salinity in the density layers has increased; where outcrops have moved into fresher surface waters, the subducted salinity decreased . Vertical and lateral shifts of density surfaces, due to both changes in water mass renewal rates and wind-driven circulation, have also contributed to the observed subsurface salinity changes . A change in total, globally integrated freshwater content and salinity requires an addition or removal of freshwater; the only significant source is land ice . The estimate of change in globally averaged salinity and freshwater content remains smaller than	0
FAQ 3.2 | Is There Evidence for Changes in the Earth's Water Cycle? The Earth's water cycle involves evaporation and precipitation of moisture at the Earth's surface. Changes in the atmosphere's water vapour content provide strong evidence that the water cycle is already responding to a warming climate. Further evidence comes from changes in the distribution of ocean salinity, which, due to a lack of long-term observations of rain and evaporation over the global oceans, has become an important proxy rain gauge. The water cycle is expected to intensify in a warmer climate, because warmer air can be moister: the atmosphere can hold about 7% more water vapour for each degree Celsius of warming. Observations since the 1970s show increases in surface and lower atmospheric water vapour , at a rate consistent with observed warming. Moreover, evaporation and precipitation are projected to intensify in a warmer climate. Recorded changes in ocean salinity in the last 50 years support that projection. Seawater contains both salt and fresh water, and its salinity is a function of the weight of dissolved salts it contains. Because the total amount of salt--which comes from the weathering of rocks--does not change over human time scales, seawater's salinity can only be altered--over days or centuries--by the addition or removal of fresh water. The atmosphere connects the ocean's regions of net fresh water loss to those of fresh water gain by moving evaporated water vapour from one place to another. The distribution of salinity at the ocean surface largely reflects the spatial pattern of evaporation minus precipitation, runoff from land, and sea ice processes. There is some shifting of the patterns relative to each other, because of the ocean's currents.	0
Subtropical waters are highly saline, because evaporation exceeds rainfall, whereas seawater at high latitudes and in the tropics--where more rain falls than evaporates--is less so . The Atlantic, the saltiest ocean basin, loses more freshwater through evaporation than it gains from precipitation, while the Pacific is nearly neutral , and the Southern Ocean  is dominated by precipitation. Changes in surface salinity and in the upper ocean have reinforced the mean salinity pattern. The evaporationdominated subtropical regions have become saltier, while the precipitation-dominated subpolar and tropical regions have become fresher. When changes over the top 500 m are considered, the evaporation-dominated Atlantic has become saltier, while the nearly neutral Pacific and precipitation-dominated Southern Ocean have become fresher . Observing changes in precipitation and evaporation directly and globally is difficult, because most of the exchange of fresh water between the atmosphere and the surface happens over the 70% of the Earth's surface covered by ocean. Long-term precipitation records are available only from over the land, and there are no long-term measurements of evaporation. Land-based observations show precipitation increases in some regions, and decreases in others, making it difficult to construct a globally integrated picture. Land-based observations have shown more extreme rainfall events, and more flooding associated with earlier snow melt at high northern latitudes, but there is strong regionality in the trends. Land-based observations are so far insufficient to provide evidence of changes in drought. Ocean salinity, on the other hand, acts as a sensitive and effective rain gauge over the ocean. It naturally reflects and smoothes out the difference between water gained by the ocean from precipitation, and water lost by the ocean through evaporation, both of which are very patchy and episodic. Ocean salinity is also affected by water runoff from the continents, and by the melting and freezing of sea ice or floating glacial ice. Fresh water added by melting ice on land will change global-averaged salinity, but changes to date are too small to observe. Data from the past 50 years show widespread salinity changes in the upper ocean, which are indicative of systematic changes in precipitation and runoff minus evaporation, as illustrated in FAQ 3.2, Figure 1. FAQ 3.2 is based on observations reported in Chapters 2 and 3, and on model analyses in Chapters 9 and 12. 	0
3.3.3.1 Pacific and Indian Oceans In the tropical Pacific, surface salinity has declined by 0.1 to 0.3 over 50 years in the precipitation-dominated western equatorial regions and by up to 0.6 to 0.75 in the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the South Pacific Convergence Zone , while surface salinity has increased by up to 0.1 over the same period in the evaporation-dominated zones in the southeastern and north-central tropical Pacific . The fresh, low-density waters in the warm pool of the western equatorial Pacific expanded in area as the surface salinity front migrated eastward by 1500 to 2500 km over the period 1955-2003 . Similarly, in the Indian Ocean, the net precipitation regions in the Bay of Bengal and the warm pool contiguous with the tropical Pacific warm pool have been freshening by up to 0.1 to 0.2, while the saline Arabian Sea and south Indian Ocean have been getting saltier by up to 0.2 . In the North Pacific, the subtropical thermocline has freshened by 0.1 since the early 1990s, following surface freshening that began around 1984 ; the freshening extends down through the intermediate water that is formed in the northwest Pacific , continuing the freshening documented by Wong et al. . Warming of the surface water that subducts to supply the intermediate water is one reason for this signal, as the freshwater from the subpolar North Pacific is now entering the subtropical thermocline at lower density. Salinity changes, together with temperature changes , affect stratification; salinity has more impact than temperature in some regions. In the western tropical Pacific, for example, the density changes from 1970 to 2003 at a trend of -0.013 kg m-3 yr-1, about 60% of that due to salinity . The decreasing density trend mainly occurs near the surface only, which should affect stratification across the base of the mixed layer. In the Oyashio region of the western North Pacific, salinity decrease near the surface accounts for about	0
3.3.3.2 Atlantic Ocean The net evaporative North Atlantic has become saltier as a whole over the past 50 years . The largest increase in the upper 700 m occurred in the Gulf Stream region  . Salinity increase is also evident following the circulation pathway of Mediterranean Outflow Water . This increase can be traced back to the western basin of the Mediterranean, where salinity of the deep water increased during the period from 1943 to the mid-2000s . During the time period between 1955-1959 and 2002-2006 , the upper 700 m of the subpolar North Atlantic freshened by up to 0.002 per decade , while an increase in surface salinity was found between the average taken over 1960-1989 and the 5-year average over 2003-2007 . Decadal and multi-decadal variability in the subpolar gyre and Nordic Seas is vigorous and has been related to various climate modes such as the NAO, the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation , and even El Nino-Southern Oscillation , obscuring long-term trends. The 1970s to 1990s freshening of the northern North Atlantic and Nordic Seas  reversed to salinification  starting in the late 1990s , and the propagation of this signal could be followed along the eastern boundary from south of 60N in the Northeast Atlantic to Fram Strait at 79N . Advection has also played a role in moving higher salinity subtropical waters to the subpolar gyre . The variability of the cross equatorial transport contribution to this budget is highly uncertain. Reversals of North Atlantic surface salinity of similar amplitude and duration to those observed in the last 50 years are apparent in the early 20th century . The evaporation-dominated subtropical South Atlantic has become saltier by 0.1 to 0.3 during the period from 1950 to 2008 .	0
3.3.3.3 Arctic Ocean Sea ice in the Arctic has declined significantly in recent decades , which might be expected to reduce the surface salinity and increase freshwater content as freshwater locked in multi-year sea ice is released. Generally, strong multi-decadal variability, regional variability, and the lack of historical observations have made it difficult to assess long-term trends in ocean salinity and freshwater content for the Arctic as a whole . The signal that is now emerging, including salinity observations from 2005 to 2010, indicates increased freshwater content, with medium confidence. Over the 20th century  the central Arctic Ocean in the upper 150 m became fresher in the 1950s and then more saline by 271	0

The FWCC time period is from 1955 to 2010  and 1950 to 2008 . Data are updated from Boyer et al.  and calculations of FWCC are done according to the method of Boyer et al. , using 5-year averages of salinity observations and fitting a linear trend to these averages. Error estimates are 95% confidence intervals. The contour interval of salinity trend in the lower panels is 0.01 PSS78 per decade and dashed contours are 0.005 PSS78 per decade.

the early 2000s, with a net small salinification over the whole record , while at the Siberian Shelf the river discharge increased  and the shelf waters became fresher . Upper ocean freshening has also been observed regionally in the southern Canada basin from the period 1950-1980 to the period 1990-2000s . These are the signals reflected in the freshwater content trend from 1955 to 2010 shown in Figure 3.5a, f: salinification at the highest latitudes and a band of freshening at about 70N to 80N. Ice production and sustained export of freshwater from the Arctic Ocean in response to winds are suggested as key contributors to the high- latitude salinification . The contrasting changes in different regions of the Arctic have been attributed to the effects of Ekman transport, sea ice formation  and a shift in the pathway of Eurasian river runoff . Between the periods 1992-1999 and 2006-2008, not only the central Arctic Ocean freshened , but also freshening is now observed in all regions including those that were becoming more saline through the early 2000s . Moreover, freshwater transport out of the Arctic has increased in that time period .	0
The similarity between the geographic distribution of significant salinity and freshwater content trends  and both the mean salinity pattern and the distribution of mean evaporation - precipitation  indicates, with medium confidence, that the large-scale pattern of net evaporation minus precipitation over the oceans has been enhanced. Whereas the surface salinity pattern could be enhanced by increased stratification due to surface warming, the large-scale changes in column-integrated freshwater content are very unlikely to result from changes in stratification in the thin surface layer. Furthermore, the large spatial scale of the observed changes in freshwater content cannot be explained by changes in ocean circulation such as shifts of gyre boundaries. The observed changes in surface and subsurface salinity require additional horizontal atmospheric water	0
transport from regions of net evaporation to regions of net precipitation. A similar conclusion was reached in AR4 . The water vapour in the troposphere has likely increased since the 1970s, due to warming . The inferred enhanced pattern of net E - P can be related to water vapor increase, although the linkage is complex . From 1950 to 2000, the large-scale pattern of surface salinity has amplified at a rate that is larger than model simulations for the historical 20th century and 21st century projections. The observed rate of surface salinity amplification is comparable to the rate expected from a water cycle response following the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship . Studies published since AR4, based on expanded data sets and new analysis approaches, have substantially decreased the level of uncertainty in the salinity and freshwater content trends , and thus increased confidence in the inferred changes of evaporation and precipitation over the ocean.	0
Both positive and negative trends in ocean salinity and freshwater content have been observed throughout much of the ocean, both at the sea surface and in the ocean interior. While similar conclusions were reached in AR4, the recent studies summarized here, based on expanded data sets and new analysis approaches, provide high confidence in the assessment of trends in ocean salinity. It is virtually certain that the salinity contrast between regions of high and low surface salinity has increased since the 1950s. It is very likely that since the 1950s, the mean regional pattern of upper ocean salinity has been enhanced: saline surface waters in the evaporation-dominated mid-latitudes have become more saline, while the relatively fresh surface waters in rainfall-dominated tropical and polar regions have become fresher. Similarly, it is very likely that the interbasin contrast between saline Atlantic and fresh Pacific surface waters has increased, and it is very likely that freshwater content in the Southern Ocean has increased. There is medium confidence that these patterns in salinity trends are caused by increased horizontal moisture transport in the atmosphere, suggesting changes in evaporation and precipitation over the ocean as the lower atmosphere has warmed. Trends in salinity have been observed in the ocean interior as well. It is likely that the subduction of surface water mass anomalies and the movement of density surfaces have contributed to the observed salinity changes on depth levels. Changes in freshwater flux and the migration of surface density outcrops caused by surface warming  have likely both contributed to the formation of salinity anomalies on density surfaces.	0
The net air-sea heat flux is the sum of two turbulent  and two radiative  components. Ocean heat gain from the atmosphere is defined to be positive according to the sign convention employed here. The latent and sensible heat fluxes are computed from the state variables using bulk parameterizations; they depend primarily on the products of wind speed and the vertical near-sea-surface gradients of humidity and temperature respectively. The air-sea freshwater flux is the difference of precipitation  and evaporation . It is linked to heat flux through the relationship between evaporation and latent heat flux. Thus, when considering potential trends in the global hydrological cycle, consistency between observed heat budget and evaporation changes is required in areas where evaporation is the dominant term in hydrological cycle changes. Ocean surface shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes can be inferred from satellite measurements using radiative transfer models, or computed using empirical formulae, involving astronomical parameters, atmospheric humidity, cloud cover and SST. The wind stress is given by the product of the wind speed squared, and the drag coefficient. For detailed discussion of all terms see, for example, Gulev et al. . Atmospheric reanalyses, discussed in Box 2.3, are referred to frequently in the following sections and for clarity the products cited are summarised here: ECMWF 40-year Reanalysis , ECMWF Interim Reanalysis , NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 , NCEP/DOE Reanalysis 2 , NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis , NASA Modern Era Reanalysis for Research and Applications  and NOAA-CIRES 20th Century Reanalysis, version 2 .	0
3.4.2.1 Turbulent Heat Fluxes and Evaporation The latent and sensible heat fluxes have a strong regional dependence, with typical values varying in the annual mean from close to zero to -220 W m-2 and -70 W m-2 respectively over strong heat loss sites . Estimates of these terms have many potential sources of error . These sources may be spatially and temporally dependent, and are difficult to quantify ; consequently flux error estimates have a high degree of uncertainty. Spurious temporal trends may arise as a result of variations in measurement method for the driving meteorological state variables, in particular wind speed . The 274	0
overall uncertainty of the annually averaged global ocean mean for each term is expected to be in the range 10 to 20%. In the case of the latent heat flux term, this corresponds to an uncertainty of up to 20 W m-2. In comparison, changes in global mean values of individual heat flux components expected as a result of anthropogenic climate change since 1900 are at the level of <2 W m-2 . Many new turbulent heat flux data sets have become available since AR4 including products based on atmospheric reanalyses, satellite and in situ observations, and hybrid or synthesized data sets that combine information from these three different sources. It is not possible to identify a single best product as each has its own strengths and weaknesses ; several data sets are summarised here to illustrate the key issues. The Hamburg Ocean-Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite  data product provides global turbulent heat fluxes  developed from observations at microwave and infrared wavelengths . In common with other satellite data sets it provides globally complete fields, however, it spans a relatively short period  and is thus of limited utility for identifying long-term changes. A significant advance in flux data set development methodology is the 1 x 1 degree grid Objectively Analysed Air-Sea heat flux  data set that covers 1958 onwards and for the first time synthesizes state variables  from reanalyses and satellite observations, prior to flux calculation . OAFlux has the potential to minimize severe spatial sampling errors that limit the usefulness of data sets based on ship observations alone and provides a new resource for temporal variability studies. However, the data sources for OAFlux changed in the 1980s, with the advent of satellite data, and the consequences of this change need to be assessed. In an alternative approach, Large and Yeager  modified NCEP1 reanalysis state variables prior to flux calculation using various adjustment techniques, to produce the hybrid Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments  turbulent fluxes for 1948-2007 . However, as the adjustments employed to produce the CORE fluxes were based on limited periods  it is not clear to what extent CORE can be reliably used for studies of interdecadal variability over the 60-year period that it spans. Analysis of OAFlux suggests that global mean evaporation may vary at inter-decadal time scales, with the variability being relatively small compared to the mean . Changing data sources, particularly as satellite observations became available in the 1980s, may contribute to this variability  and it is not yet possible to identify how much of the variability is due to changes in the observing system. The latent heat flux variations  closely follow those in evaporation  but do not scale exactly as there is an additional minor dependence on SST through the latent heat of evaporation. The large uncertainty ranges that are evident in each of the time series highlight the difficulty in establishing whether there is a trend in global ocean mean evaporation or latent heat flux. The uncertainty range for latent heat flux is much larger than the 0.5 W m-2 level of net heat flux change expected from the ocean heat content increase . Thus, it is not yet possible to use such data sets to establish global ocean multi-decadal trends in evaporation or latent	0
High accuracy in situ radiometer measurements are available at land sites since the 1960s , allowing analysis of decadal variations in the surface shortwave flux. However, this is not the case over the oceans, where there are very few in situ measurements . Consequently, for global ocean shortwave analyses it is necessary to rely on satellite observations, which are less accurate , restrict the period that can be considered to the mid-1980s onwards, but do provide homogeneous sampling. Detailed discussion of variations in global  averaged surface solar radiation is given in Section 2.3.3; confidence in variability of radiation averaged over the global ocean is low owing to the lack of direct observations.	0
The most reliable source of information for changes in the global mean net air-sea heat flux comes from the constraints provided by analyses of changes in ocean heat storage. The estimate of increase in global ocean heat content for 1971-2010 quantified in Box 3.1 corresponds to an increase in mean net heat flux from the atmosphere to the ocean of 0.55 W m-2. In contrast, closure of the global ocean mean net surface heat flux budget to within 20 W m-2 from observation based surface flux data sets has still not been reliably achieved . The increase in mean net air-sea heat flux is thus small compared to the uncertainties of the global mean. Large and Yeager  examined global ocean average net heat flux variability using the CORE data set over 1984-2006 and concluded that natural variability, rather than long-term climate change, dominates heat flux changes over this relatively short, recent period. Since AR4, some studies have shown consistency in regional net heat flux variability at sub-basin scale since the 1980s, notably in the Tropical Indian Ocean  and North Pacific . However, detection of a change in air-sea fluxes responsible for the long-term ocean warming remains beyond the ability of currently available surface flux data sets.	0
Assessment of changes in ocean precipitation at multi-decadal time scales is very difficult owing to the lack of reliable observation based data sets prior to the satellite era. The few studies available rely on reconstruction techniques. Remote sensing based precipitation observations from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project  for 1979-2003 have been used by Smith et al.  to reconstruct precipitation for 1900-2008  by employing statistical techniques that make use of the correlation between precipitation and both SST and sea level pressure . Each of the reconstructions shows both centennial and decadal variability in global ocean mean precipitation . The trend from 1900 to 2008 is 1.5 mm per month per century according to Smith et al. . For the period of overlap, the reconstructed global ocean mean precipitation 275	0

Also shown is the corresponding GPCPv2.2 derived ocean precipitation anomaly time series averaged over the same latitudinal range ; note Smith et al.  employed an earlier version of the GPCP data set leading to minor differences relative to the published time series in their paper. Precipitation anomalies were taken relative to the 1979-2008 period.	0
time series show consistent variability with GPCP as is to be expected . Focusing on the Tropical Ocean  for the recent period 1979-2005, Gu et al.  have identified a precipitation trend of 0.06 mm day-1 per decade using GPCP. Concerns have been expressed in the cited studies over the need for further work both to determine the most reliable approach to precipitation reconstruction and to evaluate the remotely sensed precipitation data sets. Given these concerns, confidence in ocean precipitation trend results is low. Evaporation and precipitation fields from atmospheric reanalyses can be tested for internal consistency of different components of the hydrological cycle. Specifically, the climatological mean value for E - P averaged over the global ocean should equal both the corresponding mean for P - E averaged over land and the moisture transport from ocean to land. Trenberth et al.  find in an assessment of eight atmospheric reanalyses that this is not the case for each product considered, and they also report spurious trends due to variations in the observing system with time. Schanze et al.  examine interannual variability within the OAFlux evaporation and GPCP precipitation data sets, and find that use of satellite data prior to 1987 is limited by discontinuities attributable to variations in data type. Thus, it is not yet possible to use such data sets to establish whether there are significant multi-decadal trends in mean E - P. However, regional trends in surface salinity since the 1950s do suggest trends in E - P over the same time . 276	0
Wind stress fields are available from reanalyses, satellite-based data sets, and in situ observations. Basin scale wind stress trends at decadal to centennial time scales have been reported for the Southern Ocean, the North Atlantic and the Tropical Pacific as detailed below. However, these results are based largely on atmospheric reanalyses, in some cases a single product, and consequently the confidence level is low to medium depending on region and time scale considered. In the Southern Ocean, the majority of reanalyses in the most comprehensive study available show an increase in the annual mean zonal wind stress . They find an increase in annual mean wind stress strength in four  of the six reanalyses considered . The mean of all reanalyses available at a given time  also shows an upward trend from about 0.15 N m-2 in the early 1950s to 0.20 N m-2 in the early 2010s. An earlier study, covering 1979-2009, found a wind stress increase in two of four reanalyses considered . A positive trend of zonal wind stress from 1980 to 2000 was also reported by Yang et al.  using a single reanalysis  and found to be consistent with increases in wind speed observations made on Macquarie Island  and by the SSM/I satellite . The wind stress strengthening is found by Yang et al.  to have a seasonal dependence, with strongest trends in January, and has been linked by them to changes in the Southern Annular Mode , which has continued to show an upward trend since AR4 . Taken as a whole, these studies provide medium confidence that Southern Ocean wind stress has strengthened since the early 1980s. A strengthening of the related wind speed field in the Southern Ocean, consistent with the increasing trend in the SAM, has also been noted in Section 2.7.2 from satellite-based analyses and atmospheric reanalyses. In the Tropical Pacific, a reanalysis based study found a strengthening of the trade wind associated wind stress for 1990-2009, but for the earlier period 1959-1989 there is no clear trend . Strengthening of the related Tropical Pacific Ocean wind speed field in recent decades is evident in reanalysis and satellite based data sets. Taken together with evidence for rates of sea level rise in the western Pacific larger than the global mean  these studies provide medium confidence that Tropical Pacific wind stress has increased since 1990. This increase may be related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation . At centennial time scales, attempts have been made to reconstruct the wind stress field in the Tropical Pacific by making use of the relationship between wind stress and SLP in combination with historic SLP data. Vecchi et al. , using this approach, found a reduction of 7% in zonal mean wind stress across the Equatorial Pacific from the 1860s to the 1990s and related it to a possible weakening of the tropical Walker circulation. Observations discussed in Section 2.7.5 indicate that this weakening has largely been offset by a stronger Walker circulation since the 1990s. Changes in winter season wind stress curl over the North Atlantic from 1950 to early 2000s from NCEP1 and ERA40 have leading modes that are highly correlated with the NAO and East Atlantic circulation patterns; each of these patterns demonstrates a trend towards more	0
Surface wind waves are generated by wind forcing and are partitioned into two components, namely wind-sea  and swell . Significant wave height  represents the measure of the wind wave field consisting of wind-sea and swell and is approximately equal to the highest one-third of wave heights. Local wind changes influence wind-sea properties, while changes in remote storms affect swell. Thus, patterns of wind wave and surface wind variability may differ because wind waves integrate wind properties over a larger domain. As wind waves integrate characteristics of atmospheric dynamics over a range of scales they potentially serve as an indicator of climate variability and change. Global and regional time series of wind waves characteristics are available from buoy data, Voluntary Observing Ship  reports, satellite measurements and model wave hindcasts. No source is superior, as all have their strengths and weaknesses .	0
3.4.5.1 Changes in Surface Waves from Voluntary Observing Ship and Wave Model Hindcasts Forced by Reanalyses AR4 reported statistically significant positive SWH trends during 1900- 2002 in the North Pacific  and stronger trends  from 1950 to 2002 for most of the mid-latitudinal North Atlantic and North Pacific, with insignificant trends, or small negative trends, in most other regions . Studies since AR4 have provided further evidence for SWH trends with more detailed quantification and regionalization. Model hindcasts based on 20CRv2  and ERA40  show increases in annual and winter mean SWH in the north-east Atlantic, although the trend magnitudes depend on the reanalysis products used . Analysis of VOS observations for 1958-2002 reveals increases in winter mean SWH over much of the North Atlantic, north of 45N, and the central to eastern mid-latitude North Pacific with typical trends of up to 20 cm per decade .	0
3.4.5.3 Changes in Surface Waves from Satellite Data Satellite altimeter observations provide a further data source for wave height variability since the mid-1980s. Altimetry is of particular value in the southern hemisphere, and in some poorly sampled regions of the northern hemisphere, where analysis of SWH trends remains a challenge due to limited in situ data and temporal inhomogeneity in the data used for reanalysis products. In the Southern Ocean, altimeter-derived SWH and model output both show regions with increasing wave height although these regions cover narrower areas in the altimeter analysis than in the models and have smaller trends . Young et al.  compiled global maps of mean and extreme  surface wind speed and SWH trends for 1985-2008 using altimeter measurements. As the length of the data set is short, it is not possible to determine whether their results reflect long-term SWH and wind speed trends, or are part of a multi-decadal oscillation. For mean SWH, their analysis shows positive linear trends of up to 10 to 15 cm per decade in some parts of the Southern Ocean  that may reflect the increase in strength of the wind stress since the early 1980s . Young et al.  note, however, that globally the level of statistical significance is generally low in the mean and 90th percentile SWH trends but increases for the 99th percentile. Small negative mean SWH trends are found in many NH ocean regions and these are of opposite sign to, and thus inconsistent with, trends in wind speed -- the latter being primarily positive. Nevertheless, for the 99th SWH percentile, strong positive trends up to 50 to 60 cm per decade were identified in the Southern Ocean, North 277	0
Uncertainties in air-sea heat flux data sets are too large to allow detection of the change in global mean net air-sea heat flux, on the order of 0.5 W m-2 since 1971, required for consistency with the observed ocean heat content increase. The accuracy of reanalysis and satellite observation based freshwater flux products is limited by changing data sources. Consequently, the products cannot yet be reliably used to directly identify trends in the regional or global distribution of evaporation or precipitation over the oceans on the time scale of the observed salinity changes since 1950.	0
Basin scale wind stress trends at decadal to centennial time scales have been observed in the North Atlantic, Tropical Pacific, and Southern Oceans with low to medium confidence. These results are based largely on atmospheric reanalyses, in some cases a single product, and the confidence level is dependent on region and time scale considered. The evidence is strongest for the Southern Ocean for which there is medium confidence that zonal mean wind stress has increased in strength since the early 1980s. There is medium confidence based on ship observations and reanalysis forced wave model hindcasts that mean significant wave height has increased since the 1950s over much of the North Atlantic north of 45N, with typical winter season trends of up to 20 cm per decade.	0
To a large degree, water properties are set at the sea surface through interaction between the ocean and the overlying atmosphere . The water characteristics resulting from these interactions  are transferred to various depths in the world ocean, depending on the density of the water. Warm, light water masses supply  the upper ocean at low to mid-latitudes, while the colder, denser water masses formed at higher latitudes supply the intermediate and deep layers of the ocean . The formation and subduction of water masses are important for the ocean's capacity to store heat, freshwater, carbon, oxygen and other properties relevant to climate. In this section, the evidence for change in some of the major water masses of the world ocean is assessed. The zonal-mean distributions of salinity, density, and temperature in each ocean basin  reflect the formation of water masses at the sea surface and their subsequent spreading into the ocean interior. For example, warm, salty waters formed in the regions of net evaporation between 10 and 30 latitude  278	0
supply the subtropical salinity maximum waters found in the upper few hundred meters in each basin . Relatively fresh water masses produced at higher latitude, where precipitation exceeds evaporation, sink and spread equatorward to form salinity minimum layers at intermediate depths. Outflow of saline water from the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea, where evaporation is very strong, accounts for the relatively high salinity observed in the upper 1000 m in the subtropical North Atlantic and North Indian basins, respectively. Many of the observed changes in zonally averaged salinity, density and temperature are aligned with the spreading paths of the major water masses , illustrating how the formation and spreading of water masses transfer anomalies in surface climate to the ocean interior. The strongest anomalies in a water mass are found near its source region. For instance, bottom and deep water anomalies are strongest in the Southern Ocean and the northern North Atlantic, with lessening amplitudes along the spreading paths of these water masses. In each basin, the subtropical salinity maximum waters have become more saline, while the low-salinity intermediate waters have become fresher . Strongest warming is observed in the upper 100 m, which has warmed almost everywhere, with reduced warming  or regions of cooling  observed between 100 and 500 m depth. Warming is observed throughout the upper 2000 m south of 40S in each basin. Shifts in the location of ocean circulation features can also contribute to the observed trends in temperature and salinity, as discussed in Section 3.2. Density decreased throughout most of the upper 2000 m of the global ocean . The decrease in near-surface density  is largest in the Pacific, where warming and freshening both act to reduce density, and smallest in the Atlantic where the salinity and temperature trends have opposite effects on density. The remainder of this section focuses on evidence of change in globally relevant intermediate, deep and bottom water masses.	0
recent studies, usually--but not always--a dipole pattern was found: on isopycnals denser than the AAIW salinity minimum, a warming and salinification was observed and on isopycnals lighter than the AAIW salinity minimum, a cooling and freshening trend . The salinity minimum core of the AAIW also underwent changes consistent with these patterns on isopycnals: In 1970-2009, south of 30S, the AAIW salinity minimum core showed a strong, large-scale shoaling  and warming , leading to lighter densities , while the salinity trends varied regionally. A long-term freshening of the AAIW core is found in the southwest Atlantic, southeast Pacific, and south-central Indian oceans, with salinification south of Africa and Australia. All trends were strongest close to the AAIW formation latitude just north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current . Both an increase in precipitation--evaporation and poleward migration of density surfaces caused by warming have likely contributed to the observed trends . Changes in AAIW properties in particular locations have also been linked to other processes, including exchange between the Indian and Atlantic basins  and changes in surface forcing related to modes of climate variability like ENSO and the SAM . Whether these changes in properties also affected the formation rates of AAIW cannot be assessed from the available observations.	0
3.5.3.1 Upper North Atlantic Deep Water Upper North Atlantic Deep Water  is formed by deep convection in the Labrador Sea between Canada and Greenland, so is also known as Labrador Sea Water . It is the shallowest component of the NADW, located above the overflow water masses that supply the Lower North Atlantic Deep Water . AR4 Chapter 5 assessed the variability in water mass properties of LSW from the 1950s. Recent studies have confirmed the large interannual-to-multi-decadeal variability of LSW properties and provided new information on variability in formation rates and the impact on heat and carbon  uptake by the deep ocean. During the 1970s and 1980s and especially the 1990s the UNADW has been cold and fresh. In Figure 3.9A it is the strong freshening signal from the 1960s to the 1990s that dominates the trend. This freshening trend reversed in the late 1990s . Estimates of the LSW formation rate3 decreased from about 7.6 to 8.9 Sv in 1997-1999  to	0
roughly 0.5 Sv in 2003-2005 , and since 1997, only less dense LSW was formed compared to the high NAO years before. There is, however, evidence that formation of denser LSW occurred in 2008 , but not in the following years . The strong variability in the formation of UNADW affected significantly the heat transfer into the deep North Atlantic . Substantial heat entered the deep North Atlantic during the low NAO years of the 1960s, when salinity was large enough to compensate for the high temperatures, and dense LSW was still formed and exported to the subtropics.	0
3.5.3.2 Lower North Atlantic Deep Water Dense waters overflowing the sills between Greenland and Scotland supply the Lower North Atlantic Deep Water . Both overflows freshened from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s . The salinity of the Faroe Bank overflow increased by 0.015 to 0.02 from 1997 to 2004, implying a density increase on the order of 0.01 kg m-3 . The other main overflow, through Denmark Strait, shows large interannual variability in temperature and salinity, but no trends for the time period 1996-2011 . Observations of the transport of the dense overflows are dominated by short-term variability and there is no evidence of a trend in the short time series available . As both overflow components descend into the North Atlantic, they entrain substantial amounts of ambient subpolar waters to create LNADW. As a whole, the LNADW in the North Atlantic cooled from the 1950s to 2005 , a signal thus stemming primarily from the entrained waters, possibly an adjustment from an unusually warm period observed in the 1920s and 1930s .	0
3.5.3.3 Antarctic Bottom Water The Antarctic Bottom Water  has warmed since the 1980s or 1990s, most noticeably near Antarctica , but with warming detectable into the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans . The warming of AABW between the 1990s and 2000s contributed to global ocean heat uptake . The global volume of the AABW layer decreased by 8.2  Sv during the last two decades , making it more likely than not that at least the export rate of AABW from the Southern Ocean declined during this period. The sources of AABW in the Indian and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean have freshened in recent decades. The strongest signal  is observed in the Ross Sea and has been linked to inflow of glacial melt water from the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas . Freshening has been observed in AABW since the 1970s in the Indian sector  and between the	0
AR4 Chapter 5 concluded that observed changes in upper ocean water masses reflect the combination of long-term trends and interannual to decadal variability related to climate modes like ENSO, NAO and SAM. The time series are still generally too short and incomplete to distinguish decadal variability from long-term trends, but understanding of the nature and causes of variability has improved in this assessment. The observed patterns of change in subsurface temperature and salinity  are consistent with understanding of how and where water masses form, enhancing the level of confidence in the assessment of the observed changes.	0
In the Weddell Sea , a contraction of the bottom water mass was observed between 1984 and 2008 at the Prime Meridian, accompanied by warming of about 0.015C, and by salinity variability on a multi-annual time scale. Transient tracer observations between 1984 and 2011 confirmed that the AABW there has become less well ventilated over that time period. The changes in the AABW, however, seem to be caused by the much stronger trends observed in the Warm Deep Water, as WDW is entrained into the AABW while sinking to the bottom, and not by changes in the AABW formation rate .	0

Salinity results are republished from Durack and Wijffels  with the unpublished temperature and density results from that study also presented.	0
From 1950 to 2000, it is likely that subtropical salinity maximum waters have become more saline, while fresh intermediate waters formed at higher latitudes have generally become fresher. In the extratropical North Atlantic, it is very likely that the temperature, salinity, and formation rate of the UNADW is dominated by strong decadal variability related to NAO. It is likely that LNADW has cooled from 1955 to 2005. It is likely that the abyssal layer ventilated by AABW warmed over much of the globe since the 1980s or 1990s respectively, and the volume of cold AABW has been reduced over this time period.	0
The present-day ocean observing system includes global observations of velocity made at the sea surface by the Global Drifter Program , and at 1000 m depth by the Argo Program . In addition, Argo observes the geostrophic shear between 2000 m and the sea surface. These two recently implemented observing systems, if sustained, will continue to document the large-spatial scale, long-time-scale variability of circulation in the upper ocean. The drifter program achieved its target of 1250 drifters in 2005, and Argo its target of 3000 floats in 2007. Historically, global measurements of ocean circulation are much sparser, so estimates of decadal and longer-term changes in circulation are very limited. Since 1992, high-precision satellite altimetry has measured the time variations in sea surface height , whose horizontal gradients are proportional to the surface geostrophic velocity. In addition, a single global top-to-bottom hydrographic survey was carried out by the World Ocean Circulation Experiment , mostly during 1991-1997, measuring geostrophic shear as well as velocity from middepth floats and from lowered acoustic Doppler current profilers. A subset of WOCE and pre-WOCE transects is being repeated at 5- to 10-year intervals . Ocean circulation studies in relation to climate have focused on variability in the wind-driven gyres  and changes in the meridional overturning circulations 	0
influenced by buoyancy loss and water-mass formation as well as wind forcing. The MOCs are responsible for much of the ocean's capacity to carry excess heat from the tropics to middle latitudes, and also are important in the ocean's sequestration of carbon. The connections between ocean basins  have also been subject to study because of the significance of inter-basin exchanges in wind-driven and thermohaline variability, and also because these can be logistically advantageous regions for measurement . An assessment is now possible of the recent mean and the changes in global geostrophic circulation over the previous decade . In general, changes in the slope of SSH across ocean basins indicate changes in the major gyres and the interior component of MOCs. Changes occurring in high gradient regions such as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current  may indicate shifts in the location of those currents. In the following, the best-studied and most significant aspects of circulation variability and change are assessed including wind-driven circulation in the Pacific, the Atlantic and Antarctic MOCs, and selected interbasin exchanges.	0
The Pacific covers over half of the global ocean area and its wind- driven variability is of interest both for its consistency with wind stress observations and for potential air-sea feedbacks that could influence climate. Changes in Pacific Ocean circulation since the early 1990s to the present, from the subarctic gyre to the southern ocean, observed with satellite ocean data and in situ ocean measurements, are in good agreement and consistent with the expected dynamical response to observed changes in wind stress forcing. The subarctic gyre in the North Pacific poleward of 40N consists of the Alaska Gyre to the east and the Western Subarctic Gyre . Since 1993, the cyclonic Alaska Gyre has intensified while decreasing in size. The shrinking is seen in the northward shift of the North Pacific Current	0
Recent studies showed that the warming of the upper ocean  very likely affects properties of water masses in the interior, in direct and indirect ways. Transport of SST and SSS anomalies caused by changes in surface heat and freshwater fluxes are brought into the ocean's interior by contact with the surface ocean . Vertical and horizontal displacements of isopycnals due to surface warming could change salinity and temperature . Circulation changes  could also change salinity by shifting the outcrop area of this isopycnal in regions with higher  E - P. Properties of several deep and bottom water masses are the product of near surface processes and significant mixing or entrainment of other ambient water masses . Changes in the properties of the entrained or admixed water mass could dominate the observed deep and bottom water mass changes, for instance, in the LNADW and the AABW in the Weddell Sea.	0
The subtropical gyre in the North Pacific also expanded along its southern boundary over the past two decades. The North Equatorial Current  shifted southward along the 137E meridian . The NEC's bifurcation latitude along the Philippine coast migrated southward from a mean latitude of 13N in the early 1990s to 11N in the late 2000s . These changes are due to a recent strengthening of the Walker circulation generating a positive wind stress curl anomaly . The enhanced regional sea level rise, >10 mm yr-1 in the western tropical North Pacific Ocean , is indicative of the changes in ocean circulation. The 20-year time-scale expansion of the North Pacific subtropical gyre has high confidence owing to the good agreement seen in satellite altimetry, subsurface ocean data and wind stress changes. This sea level increase in the western tropical Pacific also indicates a strengthening of the equatorward geostrophic limb of the subtropical cells. However, the 20-year increase reversed a longer term weakening of the subtropical cells , illustrating the high difficulty of separating secular trends from multi-decadal variability. Variability in the mid-latitude South Pacific over the past two decades is characterized by a broad increase in SSH in the 35S to 50S band and a lesser increase south of 50S along the path of the ACC . These SSH fluctuations are induced by the intensification in the SH westerlies , generating positive and negative wind stress curl anomalies north and south of 50S. In response, the southern limb of the South Pacific subtropical gyre has intensified in the past two decades  along with a southward expansion of the East Australian Current  into the Tasman Sea . The intensification in the South Pacific gyre extends to a greater depth  than that in the North Pacific gyre . As in the north, the 20-year changes in the South Pacific are seen with high confidence as they occur consistently in multiple lines of medium and high-quality data. Multiple linear regression analysis of the 20-year Pacific SSH field  indicated that interannual and decadal modes explain part of the circulation variability seen in SSH gradients, and once the aliasing by these modes is removed, the SSH trends are weaker and more spatially uniform than in a single variable trend analysis. The strengthening of SH westerlies is a multi-decadal signal, as seen in SLP difference between middle and high southern latitudes from 1949 to 2009 . The multi-decadal warming in the Southern Ocean  is consistent with a poleward displacement of 282	0
the ACC and the southern limb of the subtropical gyres, by about 1 of latitude per 40 years . The warming and corresponding sea level rise signals are not confined to the South Pacific, but are seen globally in zonal mean fields . Alory et al.  describe the broad warming consistent with a southward shift of the ACC in the South Indian Ocean. In the Atlantic, a southward trend in the location of the Brazil-Malvinas confluence  is described from surface drifters and altimetry by Lumpkin and Garzoli , and in the location of the Brazil Current separation point from SST and altimetry by Goni et al. . Enhanced surface warming and poleward displacement, globally, of the western boundary currents is described by Wu et al. . Changes in Pacific Ocean circulation over the past two decades since 1993, observed with medium to high confidence, include intensification of the North Pacific subpolar gyre, the South Pacific subtropical gyre, and the subtropical cells, plus expansion of the North Pacific subtropical gyre and a southward shift of the ACC. It is likely that these wind-driven changes are predominantly due to interannual-to-decadal variability, and in the case of the subtropical cells represent reversal of earlier multi-decadal change. Sustained time series of wind stress forcing and ocean circulation will permit increased skill in separating interannual and decadal variability from long-term trends .	0
The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation  consists of an upper limb with net northward transport between the surface and approximately 1200 m depth, and a lower limb of denser, colder, fresher waters returning southward between 1200 m and 5000 m. The AMOC is responsible for most of the meridional transport of heat and carbon by the mid-latitude NH ocean and associated with the production of about half of the global ocean's deep waters in the northern North Atlantic. Coupled climate models find that a slowdown of the AMOC in the next decades is very likely, though with uncertain magnitude . Observations of the AMOC are directed toward detecting possible long-term changes in its amplitude, its northward energy transport, and in the ocean's capacity to absorb excess heat and greenhouse gases, as well as characterizing short-term variability and its relationship to changes in forcing. Presently, variability in the full AMOC and meridional heat flux are being estimated on the basis of direct observations at 26.5N by the RAPID/MOCHA array . The array showed a mean AMOC magnitude of 18  1.0 Sv  between April 2004 and April 2009, with 10-day values ranging from 3 to 32 Sv . Earlier estimates of AMOC strength from five shipboard expeditions over 47 years at 24N  were in the range of variability seen by RAPID/MOCHA. For the 1-year period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010, the AMOC mean strength decreased to 12.8 Sv. This decrease was manifest in a shift of southward interior transport from the deep layers to the upper 1000 m. Although the AMOC weakening in 2009/2010 was large, it subsequently rebounded and with the large year-to-year changes no trend is detected in the updated time-series .	0

Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation  transport estimates : 1. RAPID/MOCHA  at 26.5N . The array monitors the top-to-bottom Atlantic wide circulation, ensuring a closed mass balance across the section, and hence a direct measure of the upper and lower limbs of the AMOC. 2. 41N : An index of maximum AMOC strength from Argo float measurements in the upper 2000 m only, combined with satellite altimeter data. The lower limb is not measured. 3. Meridional Overturning Variability Experiment  at 16N  measuring transport of North Atlantic Deep Water in the lower limb of the AMOC between 1100 m and 4800 m depth between the Caribbean and the mid-Atlantic Ridge. This transport is thought to be representative of maximum MOC variability based on model validation experiments. The temporal resolution of the three time series is 10 days for 16N and 26N and 1 month for 41N. The data have been 3-month low-pass filtered. Means and standard deviations for the common period of 2 April 2004 to 1 April 2010 are 17.5  3.8 Sv, 13.8  3.3 Sv and -20.3  4.8 Sv  for 26.5N, 41N and 16N respectively. The means over this period are indicated by the horizontal line on each time series.	0
Observations targeting one limb of the AMOC include Willis  at 41N combining velocities from Argo drift trajectories, Argo temperature/salinity profiles, and satellite altimeter data . Here the upper limb AMOC magnitude is 15.5 Sv  2.4 from 2002 to 2009 . This study suggests an increase in the AMOC strength by about 2.6 Sv from 1993 to 2010, though with low confidence because it is based on SSH alone in the pre-Argo interval of 1993-2001. At 16N, geostrophic array-based estimates of the southward transport of the AMOC's lower limb, in the depth range 1100 to 4700 m, have been made continuously since 2000 . These are the longest continuous measurements of the southward flow of NADW in the western basin. Whereas the period 2000 to mid-2009 suggested a downward trend , the updated time series  has no apparent trend. In the South Atlantic at 35S, estimates of the AMOC upper limb were made using 27 high-resolution XBT transects  and Argo float data . The upperlimb AMOC magnitude was 18.1 Sv  2.3 , consistent with the NH estimates.	0
The continuous AMOC estimates at 16N, 26.5N and 41N have time series of length 11, 7, and 9 years respectively . All show a substantial variability of ~3 to 5 Sv for 3-month low-pass time series, with a peak-to-peak interannual variability of 5 Sv. The shortness of these time series and the relatively large interannual variability emerging in them suggests that trend estimates be treated cautiously, and no trends are seen at 95% confidence in any of the time series. Continuous time series of AMOC components, longer than those of the complete system at 26.5N, have been obtained using moored instrumentation. These include the inflow into the Arctic through Fram Strait  and through the Barents Sea , dense inflows across sills between Greenland and Scotland  and North Atlantic Deep Water carried southward within the Deep Western Boundary Current at 53N  and at 39N . The longest time series of observations of ocean transport in the world , extend from the mid-1960s to the present , with small decadal variability of about 1 Sv and no evidence of a multi-decadal trend . Similarly, none of the other direct, continuous transport estimates of single components of the AMOC exhibit long-term trends at 95% significance. Indirect estimates of the annual average AMOC strength and variability can be made  from diapycnal transports driven by air-sea fluxes  or by inverse techniques . Decadal fluctuations of up to 2 Sv are seen, but no trend. Consistent with Grist et al. , the sea level index of the strength of the AMOC, based on several coherent western boundary tide gauge records between 39N and 43N at the American coast  shows no long-term trend from 1960 to 2007. In summary, measurements of the AMOC and of circulation elements contributing to it, at various latitudes and covering different time 284	0
Sinking of AABW near Antarctica supplies about half of the deep and abyssal waters in the global ocean . AABW spreads northward as part of the global overturning circulation and ventilates the bottom-most portions of much of the ocean. Observed widespread warming of AABW in recent decades  implies a concomitant reduction in its northward spread. Reductions of 1 to 4 Sv in northward transports of AABW across 24N have been estimated by geostrophic calculations using repeat oceanographic section data between 1981 and 2010 in the North Atlantic Ocean  and between 1985 and 2005 in the North Pacific . A global full-depth ocean data assimilation study shows a reduction of northward AABW flow across 35S of >2 Sv in the South Pacific starting around 1985 and >1 Sv in the western South Atlantic since around 1975 . This reduction is consistent with the contraction in volume of AABW  discussed in Section 3.5.4. Several model studies have suggested that changes in wind stress over the Southern Ocean  may drive a change in the Southern Ocean overturning circulation . A recent analysis of changes in chlorofluorocarbon  concentrations in the Southern Ocean supports the idea that the overturning cell formed by upwelling of deep water and sinking of intermediate waters has slowed, but does not quantify the change in transport .	0
3.6.5.1 The Indonesian Throughflow The transport of water from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean via the Indonesian archipelago is the only low-latitude exchange between oceans, and is significant because it is a fluctuating sink/source for very warm tropical water in the two oceans. The Indonesian Throughflow  transport has been estimated from hydrographic and XBT transects between Australia and Indonesia, and as a synthesis of these together with satellite altimetry, wind stress, and other data , and from moorings in the principal Indonesian passages. The most comprehensive observations were obtained in 2004-2006 in three passages by the INSTANT mooring array , and show a westward transport of 15.0  Sv. For the main passage, Makassar Strait, Susanto et al.  find 13.3  Sv in the period 2004-2009, with small year-to-year differences. On a longer time scale, the Wunsch  estimate for 1992-2007 was 11.5 Sv  westward, and thus consistent with INSTANT. Wainwright et al.  analyzed data between Australia and Indonesia beginning in the early 1950s, and found a change in the slope of the thermocline for data before and after 1976, indicating a decrease in geostrophic transport by 23%, consistent with a weakening of the tradewinds (e.g.,	0
3.6.5.2 The Antarctic Circumpolar Current There is medium confidence that the westerly winds in the Southern Ocean have increased since the early 1980s , associated with a positive trend in the SAM ; also see Sections 3.4.4 and 3.6.3). Although a few observational studies have found evidence for correlation between SAM and ACC transport on subseasonal to interannual scales , there is no significant observational evidence of an increase in ACC transport associated with the multi-decadal trend in wind forcing over the Southern Ocean. Repeat hydrographic sections spread unevenly over 35 years in Drake Passage , south of Africa  and south of Australia  reveal moderate variability but no significant trends in these sparse and discontinuous records. A comparison of recent Argo data and a long-term climatology showed that the slope of density surfaces  associated with the ACC had not changed in recent decades . Eddy-resolving models suggest the ACC transport is relatively insensitive to trends in wind forcing, consistent with the ACC being in an "eddy-saturated" state where increases in wind forcing are compensated by changes in the eddy field . While there is limited evidence for  multi-decadal changes in transport of the ACC, observations of changes in temperature, salinity and SSH indicate the current system has shifted poleward  .	0
3.6.5.3 North Atlantic/Nordic Seas Exchange There is no observational evidence of changes during the past two decades in the flow across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge, which connects the North Atlantic with the Norwegian and Greenland Seas. Direct current measurements since the mid-1990s have not shown any significant trends in volume transport for any of the three inflow branches . The two primary pathways for the deep southward overflows across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge are the Denmark Strait and Faroe Bank Channel. Moored measurements of the Denmark Strait overflow demonstrate significant interannual transport variations , but the time series is not long enough to detect a multi-decadal trend. Similarly, a 10-year time series of moored measurements in the Faroe Bank channel  does not show a trend in transport.	0
Recent observations have greatly increased the knowledge of the amplitude of variability in major ocean circulation systems on time scales from years to decades. It is very likely that the subtropical gyres in the North Pacific and South Pacific have expanded and strengthened since 1993, but it is about as likely as not that this reflects a decadal oscillation linked to changes in wind forcing, including changes in winds associated with the modes of climate variability. There is no evidence for a long-term trend in the AMOC amplitude, based on a decade of continuous observations plus several decades of sparse hydrographic transects, or in the longer records of components of the AMOC such as the Florida Current , although there are large interannual fluctuations. Nor is there evidence of a trend in the transports of the ITF , the ACC , or between the Atlantic and Nordic Seas . Given the short duration of direct measurements of ocean circulation, we have very low confidence that multi-decadal trends can be separated from decadal variability.	0
Sea level varies as the ocean warms or cools, as water is transferred between the ocean and continents, between the ocean and ice sheets, and as water is redistributed within the ocean due to the tides and changes in the oceanic and atmospheric circulation. Sea level can rise or fall on time scales ranging from hours to centuries, spatial scales from <1 km to global, and with height changes from a few millimeters to a meter or more . Sea level integrates and reflects multiple climatic and dynamical signals. Measurements of sea level are the longest-running ocean observation system. This section assesses interannual and longer variations in non-tidal sea level from the instrumented period . Sections 4.3.3 and 4.4.2 assess contributions of glaciers and ice sheets to sea level, Section 5.6 assess reconstructions of sea level from the geological record, Section 10.4.3 assesses detection and attribution of human influences on sea level change, and Chapter 13 synthesizes results and assesses projections of sea level change. The sea level observing system has evolved over time. There are intermittent records of sea level at four sites in Northern Europe starting in the 1700s. By the late 1800s, there were more tide gauges being operated in Northern Europe, on both North American coasts, and in Australia and New Zealand in the SH . Tide gauges began to be placed on islands far from continental coasts starting in the early 20th century, but a majority of deep-ocean islands did not have an operating tide gauge suitable for climate studies until the early 1970s. Tide gauge records measure the combined effect of ocean volume change and vertical land motion . For detecting climate related variability of the ocean volume, the VLM signal must be removed. One component that can be accounted for to a certain extent is the VLM 285	0
Tide gauges and satellite altimetry measure the combined effect of ocean warming and mass changes on ocean volume. Although variations in the density related to upper-ocean salinity changes cause regional changes in sea level, when globally averaged their effect on sea level rise is an order of magnitude or more smaller than thermal effects . The thermal contribution to sea level can be calculated from in situ temperature measurements . It has only been possible to directly measure the mass component of sea level since the launch of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment  in 2002 . Before that, estimates were based either on estimates of glacier and ice sheet mass losses or using residuals between sea level measured by altimetry or tide gauges and estimates of the thermosteric component , which allowed for the estimation of seasonal and interannual variations as well. GIA also causes a gravitational signal in GRACE data that must be removed in order to determine present-day mass changes; this correction is of the same order of magnitude as the expected trend and is still uncertain at the 30% level .	0
Satellite radar altimeters in the 1970s and 1980s made the first nearly global observations of sea level, but these early measurements were highly uncertain and of short duration. The first precise record began with the launch of TOPEX/Poseidon  in 1992. This satellite and its successors  have provided continuous measurements of sea level variability at 10-day intervals between approximately 66 latitude. Additional altimeters in different orbits  have allowed for measurements up to 82 latitude and at different temporal sampling , although these measurements are not as accurate as those from the T/P and Jason satellites. Unlike tide gauges, altimetry measures sea level relative to a geodetic reference frame  and thus will not be affected by VLM, although a small correction that depends on the area covered by the satellite  must be added to account for the change in location of the ocean bottom due to GIA relative to the reference frame of the satellite .	0
associated with glacial isostatic adjustment  . In some areas, however, VLM from tectonic activity, groundwater mining, or hydrocarbon extraction is greater than GIA ; these effects can be reduced by selecting gauges with no known tectonic or subsidence issues  or by selecting gauges where GIA models have small differences . More recently, Global Positioning System  receivers have been installed at tide gauge sites to measure VLM as directly as possible . However, these measurements of VLM are only available since the late 1990s at the earliest, and either have to be extrapolated into the past to apply to older records, or used to identify sites without extensive VLM.	0

averaging ; or projecting tide gauge records onto empirical orthogonal functions  computed from modern altimetry  or EOFs from ocean models . Different approaches show very similar long-term trends, but noticeably different interannual and decadal-scale variability . Only the time series from Church and White  extends to 2010, so it is used in the assessment of rates of sea level rise. The rate from 1901 to 2010 is 1.7  mm yr-1 , which is unchanged from the value in AR4. Rates computed using alternative approaches over the longest common interval  agree with this estimate within the uncertainty. Since AR4, significant progress has been made in quantifying the uncertainty in GMSL associated with unknown VLM and uncertainty in GIA models. Differences between rates of GMSL rise computed with and without VLM from GPS are smaller than the estimated u ncertainties . Use of different GIA	0
models to correct tide gauge measurements results in differences less than 0.2 mm yr-1 , and rates of GMSL rise computed from uncorrected tide gauges differ from rates computed from GIA-corrected gauges by only 0.4 mm yr-1 , again within uncertainty estimates. This agreement gives increased confidence that the 20th century rate of GMSL rise is not biased high due to unmodeled VLM at the gauges. Satellite altimetry can resolve interannual fluctuations in GMSL better than tide gauge records because less temporal smoothing is required . It is clear that deviations from the long-term trend can exist for periods of several years, especially during El Nino  and La Nina  events . The rate of GMSL rise from 1993- 2010 is 3.2  mm yr-1 based on the average of altimeter time series published by multiple groups . As noted in AR4, this rate continues to be statistically higher than that for the 20th century 287	0
. There is high confidence that this change is real and not an artefact of the different sampling or change in instrumentation, as the trends estimated over the same period from tide gauges and altimetry are consistent. Although the rate of GMSL rise has a slightly lower trend between 2005 and 2010 , this variation is consistent with earlier interannual fluctuations in the record , mostly attributable to El Nino/La Nina cycles . At least 15 years of data are required to reduce the impact of interannual variations associated with El Nino or La Nina on estimated trends .	0
Since AR4, estimates of both the thermosteric component and mass component of GMSL rise have improved, although estimates of the mass component are possible only since the start of the GRACE measurements in 2002. After correcting for biases in older XBT data , the rate of thermosteric sea level rise in the upper 700 m since 1971 is 50% higher than estimates used for AR4 . Because of much sparser upper ocean measurements before 1971, we estimate the trend only since then . The warming of the upper 700 m from 1971 to 2010 caused an estimated mean thermosteric rate of rise of 0.6  mm yr-1 , which is 30% of the observed rate of GMSL rise for the same period . Although still a short record, more numerous, better distributed, and higher quality profile measurements from the Argo program are now being used to estimate the steric component for the upper 700 m as well as for the upper 2000 m . However, these data have been shown to be best suited for global analyses after 2005 owing to a combination of interannual variability and large biases when using data before 2005 owing to sparser sampling . Comparison of sparse but accurate temperature measurements from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment in the 1990s with Argo data from 2006 to 2008 also indicates a significant rise in global thermosteric sea level, although the estimate is uncertain owing to relatively sparse 1990s sampling . Observations of the contribution to sea level rise from warming below 700 m are still uncertain due to limited historical data, especially in the Southern Ocean . Before Argo, they are based on 5-year averages to 2000 m depth . From 1971 to 2010, the estimated trend for the contribution between 700 m and 2000 m is 0.1  mm yr-1 . To measure the contribution of warming below 2000 m, much sparser but very accurate temperature profiles along repeat hydrographic sections are utilized . The studies have found a significant warming trend between 1000 and 4000 m within and south of the Sub-Antarctic Front . The estimated total contribution of warming below 2000 m to global mean sea level rise between about 1992 and 2005 is 0.1  mm yr-1 . Detection of the mass component of sea level from the GRACE mission was not assessed in AR4, as the record was too short and there was still considerable uncertainty in the measurements and corrections 288	0
required. Considerable progress has been made since AR4, and the mass component of sea level measured by GRACE has been increasing at a rate between 1 and 2 mm yr-1 since 2002 . Differences between studies are due partially to the time periods used to compute trends, as there are significant interannual variations in the mass component of GMSL , but also to substantial differences in GIA corrections applied, of order 1 mm yr-1. Recent evaluations of the GIA correction have found explanations for the difference , but uncertainty of 0.3 mm yr-1 is still probable. Measurements of sea level from altimetry and the sum of observed steric and mass components are also consistent at monthly scales during the time period when Argo data have global distribution , which gives high confidence that the current ocean observing system is capable of resolving the rate of sea level rise and its components.	0
Large-scale spatial patterns of sea level change are known to high precision only since 1993, when satellite altimetry became available . These data have shown a persistent pattern of change since the early 1990s in the Pacific, with rates of rise in the Warm Pool of the western Pacific up to three times larger than those for GMSL, while rates over much of the eastern Pacific are near zero or negative . The increasing sea level in the Warm Pool started shortly before the launch of TOPEX/Poseidon , and is caused by an intensification of the trade winds  since the late 1980s that may be related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation  . The lower rate of sea level rise since 1993 along the western coast of the United States has also been attributed to changes in the wind stress curl over the North Pacific associated with the PDO . While global maps can be created using EOF analysis , pre-1993 results are still uncertain, as the method assumes that the EOFs since 1993 are capable of representing the patterns in previous decades, and results may be biased in the middle of the ocean where there are no tide gauges to constrain the estimate . Several studies have examined individual long tide gauge records in the North Atlantic and found coherent decadal-scale fluctuations along both the USA east coast , the European coast , and the marginal seas in the western North Pacific , all related to natural climate variability. There is still considerable uncertainty on how long large-scale patterns of regional sea level change can persist, especially in the Pacific where the majority of tide gauge records are less than 40 years long. Based on analyses of the longest records in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans  there are significant multi-decadal variations in regional sea level . Hence local rates of sea level rise can	0
The preceding discussion of regional sea level trends has focused on effects that appear to be related to regional ocean volume change, and not those due to vertical land motion. As discussed in Section 3.7.1, vertical land motion can dramatically affect local sea level change. Some extreme examples of vertical land motion are in Neah Bay, Washington, where the signal is +3.8 mm yr-1 ; Galveston, Texas, where the value is -5.9 mm yr-1 ; and Nedre Gavle, Sweden where the value is +7.1 mm yr-1 , all computed from nearby GPS receivers . These areas will all have longterm rates of sea level rise that are significantly higher or lower than those due to ocean volume change alone, but as these rates are not related to climate change, they are not discussed here.	0
AR4 concluded that there was "high confidence that the rate of global sea level rise increased from the 19th to the 20th century" but could not be certain as to whether the higher rate since 1993 was reflective of decadal variability or a further increase in the longer-term trend. Since AR4, there has been considerable effort to quantify the level of decadal and multi-decadal variability and to detect acceleration in GMSL and mean sea level at individual tide gauges. It has been clear for some time that there was a significant increase in the rate of sea level rise in the four oldest records from Northern Europe starting in the early to mid-19th century . Estimates of the change in the rate have been computed, either by comparing trends over 100-year intervals for the Stockholm site , or by fitting a quadratic term to all the long records starting before 1850 . The results are consistent and indicate a significant acceleration that started in the early to mid-19th century , although some have argued it may have started in the late 1700s . The increase in the rate of sea level rise at Stockholm  has been based on differencing 100-year trends from 1774-1884 and 1885-1985. The estimated change is 1.0  mm yr-1 per century . Although sites in other ocean basins do show an increased trend after 1860 , it is impossible to detect a change in the early to mid-1800s in other parts of the ocean using tide gauge data alone, as there are no observations. Numerous studies have attempted to quantify if a detectable acceleration has continued into the 20th century, typically by fitting a quadratic to data at individual tide gauges  as well as to reconstructed time series of GMSL , or by examining differences in long-term rates computed at different tide gauges . Woodworth et al.  find significant quadratic terms at the sites that begin before 1860 . Other authors using more numerous but significantly shorter records have found either insignificant or small negative quadratic terms in sea	0
level around the United States and Australia since 1920 , or large positive quadratic values since 1950 along the U.S. east coast . However, fitting a quadratic term to tide gauge data after 1920 results in highly variable, insignificant quadratic terms , and so only studies that use data before 1920 and that extend until 2000 or beyond are suitable for evaluating long-term acceleration of sea level. A long time scale is needed because significant multi-decadal variability appears in numerous tide gauge records during the 20th century . The multi-decadal variability is marked by an increasing trend starting in 1910-1920, a downward trend  starting around 1950, and an increasing trend starting around 1980. The pattern can be seen in New York, Mumbai and Fremantle records, for instance , as well as 14 other gauges representing all ocean basins , and in all reconstructions . It is also seen in an analysis of upper 400 m temperature . Although the calculations of 18-year rates of GMSL rise based on the different reconstruction methods disagree by as much as 2 mm yr-1 before 1950 and on details of the variability , all do indicate 18-year trends that were significantly higher than the 20th century average at certain times  and lower at other periods , likely related to multi-decadal variability. Several studies have suggested these variations may be linked to climate fluctuations like the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation  and/or Pacific Decadal Oscillation  , but these results are not conclusive. While technically correct that these multi-decadal changes represent acceleration/deceleration of sea level, they should not be interpreted as change in the longer-term rate of sea level rise, as a time series longer than the variability is required to detect those trends. Using data 5 18-year GMSL trends 	0
extending from 1900 to after 2000, the quadratic term computed from both individual tide gauge records and GMSL reconstructions is significantly positive . Church and White  report that the estimated acceleration term in GMSL  is 0.009  mm yr-2  from 1880 to 2009, which is consistent with the other published estimates  that use records longer than 100 years. Chambers et al.  find that modelling a period near 60 years removes much of the multi-decadal variability of the 20th century in the tide gauge reconstruction time series. When a 60-year oscillation is modeled along with an acceleration term, the estimated acceleration in GMSL since 1900 ranges from: 0.000  mm yr-2 in the Ray and Douglas  record, 0.013  mm yr-2 in the Jevrejeva et al.  record, and 0.012  mm yr-2 in the Church and White  record. Thus, while there is more disagreement on the value of a 20th century acceleration in GMSL when accounting for multi-decadal fluctuations, two out of three records still indicate a significant positive value. The trend in GMSL observed since 1993, however, is not significantly larger than the estimate of 18-year trends in previous decades .	0
Aside from non-climatic events such as tsunamis, extremes in sea level  tend to be caused by large storms, especially when they occur at times of high tide. However, any low-pressure system offshore with associated high winds can cause a coastal flooding event depending on the duration and direction of the winds. Evaluation of changes in frequency and intensity of storms have been treated in Sections 2.6.3 and 2.6.4, as well as SREX Chapter 3 . The main conclusions from both are that there is low confidence of any trend or long term change in tropical or extratropic storm frequency or intensity in any ocean basin, although there is robust evidence for an increase in the most intense tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic basin since the 1970s. The magnitude and frequency of extreme events can still increase without a change in storm intensity, however, if the mean water level is also increasing. AR4 concluded that the highest water levels have been increasing since the 1950s in most regions of the world, caused mainly by increasing mean sea level. Studies published since AR4 c ontinue to support this conclusion, although higher regional extremes are also caused by large interannual and multi-decadal variations in sea level associated with climate fluctuations such as ENSO, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation, among others . Global analyses of the changes in extreme sea level are limited, and most reports are based on analysis of regional data . Estimates of changes in extremes rely either on the analysis of local tide gauge data, or on multi-decadal hindcasts of a dynamical model . Most analyses have focused on specific regions and find that extreme values have been increasing since the 1950s, using various statistical measures such as annual maximum surge, annual maximum surge-at-high-water, monthly mean 290	0
high water level, changes in number of high storm surge events, or changes in 99th percentile events . A global analysis of tide gauge records has been performed for data from the 1970s onwards when the global data sampling has been robust and finds that the magnitude of extreme sea level events has increased in all regions studied since that time . The height of a 50-year flood event has increased anywhere from 2 to more than 10 cm per decade since 1970 , although some areas have seen a negative rate because vertical land motion is much larger than the rate of mean sea level rise. However, when the annual median height at each gauge is removed to reduce the effect of local mean sea level rise, interannual and decadal fluctuations, and vertical land motion, the rate of extreme sea level change drops in 49% of the gauges to below significance , while at 45% it fell to less than 5 mm yr-1. Only 6% of tide gauge records evaluated had a change in the amplitude of more than 5 mm yr-1 after removing mean sea level variations, mainly in the southeast United States, the western Pacific, Southeast Asia and a few locations in Northern Europe. The higher rates in the southeastern United States have been linked to larger storm surge events unconnected to global sea level rise . 	0
It is virtually certain that globally averaged sea level has risen over the 20th century, with a very likely mean rate between 1900 and 2010 of 1.7  mm yr-1 and 3.2  mm yr-1 between 1993 and 2010. This assessment is based on high agreement among multiple studies using different methods, and from independent observing systems  since 1993. It is likely that a rate comparable to that since 1993 occurred between 1920 and 1950, possibly due to a multi-decadal climate variation, as individual tide gauges around the world and all reconstructions of GMSL show increased rates of sea level rise during this period. Although local vertical land motion can cause even larger rates of sea level rise  relative to the coastline, it is very likely that this does not affect the estimates of the global average rate, based on multiple estimations of the average with and without VLM corrections. It is virtually certain that interannual and decadal changes in the large-scale winds and ocean circulation can cause significantly higher or lower rates over shorter periods at individual locations, as this has been observed in tide gauge records around the world. Warming of the upper 700 m of the ocean has very likely contributed an average of 0.6  mm yr-1 of sea level change since 1971. Warming between 700 m and 2000 m has likely been contributing an additional 0.1 mm yr-1  of sea level rise since 1971, and warming below 2000	0
It is very likely that the rate of mean sea level rise along Northern European coastlines has accelerated since the early 1800s and that this has continued through the 20th century, as the increased rate since 1875 has been observed in multiple long tide gauge records and by different groups using different analysis techniques. It is likely that sea level rise throughout the NH has also accelerated since 1850, as this is also observed in a smaller number of gauges along the coast of North America. Two of the three time series based on reconstructing GMSL from tide gauge data back to 1900 or earlier indicate a significant positive acceleration, while one does not. The range is -0.002 to 0.019 mm yr-2, so it is likely that GMSL has accelerated since 1900. Finally, it is likely that extreme sea levels have increased since 1970, largely as a result of the rise in mean sea level.	0
also provides an important sink for carbon dioxide released by human activities, the anthropogenic CO2 . Currently, an amount of CO2 equivalent to approximately 30% of the total human emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere is accumulating in the ocean . In this section, observations of change in the ocean uptake of carbon, the inventory of Cant, and ocean acidification are assessed, as well as changes in oxygen and nutrients. Chapter 6 provides a synthesis of the overall carbon cycle, including the ocean, atmosphere and biosphere and considering both past trends and future projections.	0
The air-sea flux of CO2 is computed from the observed difference in the partial pressure of CO2  across the air-water interface , the solubility of CO2 in seawater, and the gas transfer velocity . However, the limited geographic and temporal coverage of the pCO2 measurement as well as uncertainties in wind forcing and transfer velocity parameterizations mean that uncertainties in global and regional fluxes calculated from measurements of pCO2 can be as larges as 50% . Using pCO2 data in combination with the riverine input Gruber et al.  estimated a global uptake rate of 1.9  PgC yr-1 for the time period 1995-2000 and Takahashi et al.  found 2.0  PgC yr-1 normalized to the year 2000. Uncertainties in fluxes calculated from pCO2 are too large to detect trends in global ocean carbon uptake. Trends in surface ocean pCO2 are calculated from ocean time series stations and repeat hydrographic sections in the North Atlantic and North Pacific . At all locations and for all time periods shown, pCO2 in both the atmosphere and ocean has increased, while pH and  have decreased. At some sites, oceanic surface pCO2 increased faster than the atmospheric trend, implying a decreasing uptake of atmospheric CO2 at those locations. The oceanic pCO2 trend can differ from that in the atmosphere owing to changes in the intensity of biological production and changes in physical conditions, for instance between El Nino and La Nina . Although local variations of pCO2 with time have little effect on the atmospheric CO2 growth rate in the short term, they provide important information on the dynamics of the ocean carbon cycle and the potential for longer-term climate feedbacks. For example, El Nino and La Nina can drive large changes in the efflux of CO2 in the Pacific. Differences in pCO2 can exceed 100 atm in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific between El Nino and La Nina; an increase in pCO2 observed between 1998 and 2004 was attributed to wind and circulation changes associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation . CO2 uptake in the North Atlantic decreased by 0.24  PgC yr-1 between 1994 and 2003  and has partially recovered since then . Linear trends for the North Atlantic from 1995 to 2009 reveal an increased 292	0
Ocean carbon uptake and storage is inferred from changes in the inventory of anthropogenic carbon. Cant cannot be measured directly but is calculated from observations of ocean properties . Two independent data-based methods to calculate anthropogenic carbon inventories exist: the C* method , and the transit time distribution  method . The Green's function approach that applies the maximum entropy de-convolution methodology  is related to the latter. These approaches use different tracer data, for instance, the TTD method is based mostly on chlorofluorcarbon measurements. Changes due to variability in ocean productivity  are not considered. Estimates of the global inventory of Cant  calculated using these methods have a mean value of 118 PgC and a range of 93 to 137 PgC in 1994 and a mean of 160 PgC and range of 134 to 186 PgC in 2010 . When combined with model results , Khatiwala et al.  arrive at a "best" estimate of the global ocean inventory  of anthropogenic carbon from 1750 to 2010 of 155 PgC with an uncertainty of 20% . While the estimates of total inventory agree within their uncertainty, the different methods result in significant differences in the inferred spatial distribution of Cant, particularly at high latitudes. The Cant inventory "best" estimate of 155 PgC  corresponds to an uptake rate of 2.3  PgC yr-1 from 2000 to 2010, in close agreement with an independent estimate of 2.5  PgC yr-1 based on atmospheric O2/ N2 measurements obtained for the same period . The O2/N2 method resulted in 2.2  0.6 PgC yr-1 for the time period 1990 to 2000 and 2.5  0.6 for the period from 2000 to 2010 . These estimates are also consistent with an independent estimate of 1.9  0.4 PgC yr-1 for the period between 1970 and 1990 based on depth-integrated d13C changes  and with estimates inferred from pCO2. The storage rate of anthropogenic CO2 is assessed by calculating the change in Cant concentrations between two time periods. Regional observations of the storage rate are in general agreement with that expected from the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and with the tracer-based estimates. However, there are significant spatial and temporal variations in the degree to which the inventory of Cant	0
The uptake of CO2 by the ocean changes the chemical balance of seawater through the thermodynamic equilibrium of CO2 with seawater. Dissolved CO2 forms a weak acid  and, as CO2 in seawater increases, the pH, carbonate ion , and calcium carbonate  saturation state of seawater decrease while bicarbonate ion  increases . Variations in oceanic total dissolved inorganic carbon  and pCO2 reflect changes in both the natural carbon cycle and the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere. The mean pH  of surface waters ranges between 7.8 and 8.4 in the open ocean, so the ocean remains mildly basic  at present . Ocean uptake of CO2 results in gradual acidification of seawater; this	0
tracks changes in the atmosphere . The North Atlantic, in particular, is an area with high variability in circulation and deep water formation, influencing the Cant inventory. As a result of the decline in Labrador Sea Water  formation since 1997 , the Cant increase between 1997 and 2003 was smaller in the subpolar North Atlantic than expected from the atmospheric increase, in contrast to the subtropical and equatorial Atlantic . Perez et al.  also noted the dependence of the Cant storage rate in the North Atlantic on the NAO, with high Cant storage rate during phases of high NAO  and low storage during phases of low NAO . Wanninkhof et al.  found a smaller inventory increase in the North Atlantic compared to the South Atlantic between 1989 and 2005.	0
Direct measurements on ocean time-series stations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific record decreasing pH with rates ranging between -0.0014 and -0.0024 yr-1 . Directly measured pH differences in the surface mixed layer along repeat transects in the central North Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Alaska showed a -0.0017 yr-1 decline in pH between 1991 and 2006, in agreement with observations at the time-series sites . This rate of pH change is also consistent with repeat transects of CO2 and pH measurements in the western North Pacific  . The pH changes in southern ocean surface waters are less certain because of the paucity of longterm time-series observations there, but pCO2 measurements collected by ships-of-opportunity indicate similar rates of pH decrease there . Uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is the dominant cause of observed changes in the carbonate chemistry of surface waters . Changes in carbonate chemistry in subsurface waters can also reflect local physical and biological variability. As an example, while pH changes in the mixed layer of the North Pacific Ocean can be explained solely by equilibration with atmospheric CO2, declines in pH between 800 m and the mixed layer in the time period 1991-2006 were attributed in approximately equal measure to anthropogenic and natural variations . Figure 3.19 shows the portion of pH changes between the surface and 1000 m that were attributed solely to the effects of anthropogenic CO2. Seawater pH and  decreased by 0.0014 to 0.0024 yr-1 and ~0.4 to 0.9 mol kg-1 yr-1, respectively, between 1988 and 2009 . Over longer time periods, anthropogenic changes in ocean chemistry are expected to become increasingly prominent relative to changes imparted by physical and biological variability. The consistency of these observations demonstrates that the pH of surface waters has decreased as a result of ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere. There is high confidence that the pH decreased by 0.1 since the preindustrial era.	0

As a consequence of the early introduction of standardized methods and the relatively wide interest in the distribution of dissolved oxygen, the historical record of marine oxygen observations is generally richer than that of other biogeochemical parameters, although still sparse compared to measurements of temperature and salinity . Dissolved oxygen changes in the ocean thermocline has generally decreased since 1960, but with strong regional variations . Oxygen concentrations at 300 dbar decreased between 50S and 50N at a mean rate of 0.63 mol kg-1 per decade between 1960 and 2010 . For the period 1970 to 1990, the mean annual global oxygen loss between 100 m and 1000 m was calculated to be 0.55  0.13 x 1014 mol yr-1 .	0
The major controls on seawater pH are atmospheric CO2 exchange, the production and respiration of dissolved and particulate organic matter in the water column, and the formation and dissolution of calcium carbonate minerals. Oxidation of organic matter lowers dissolved oxygen concentrations, adds CO2 to solution, reduces pH, carbonate ion  and calcium carbonate  saturation states , and lowers the pH of seawater in subsurface waters . As a result of these processes, minimum pH values in the oceanic water column are generally found near the depths of the oxygen minimum layer. When CO2 reacts with seawater it forms carbonic acid , which is highly reactive and reduces the concentration of carbonate ion  and can affect shell formation for marine animals such as corals, plankton, and shellfish. This process could affect fundamental biological and chemical processes of the sea in coming decades . 	0
Since the beginning of the industrial era, the release of CO2 from industrial and agricultural activities has resulted in atmospheric CO2 concentrations that have increased from approximately 280 ppm to about 392 ppm in 2012 . The oceans have absorbed approximately 155 PgC from the atmosphere over the last two and a half centuries . This natural process of absorption has benefited humankind by significantly reducing the greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere and abating some of the impacts of global warming. However, the ocean's uptake of carbon dioxide is having a significant impact on the chemistry of seawater. The average pH of ocean surface waters has already fallen by about 0.1 units, from about 8.2 to 8.1 , since the beginning of the industrial revolution . Estimates of future atmospheric and oceanic carbon dioxide concentrations indicate that, by the end of this century, the average surface ocean pH could be lower than it has been for more than 50 million years .	0

that oxygen concentrations decreased in most tropical regions at an average rate of 2 to 3 mol kg-1 per decade . Data from one of the longest time-series sites in the subpolar North Pacific  reveal a persistent declining oxygen trend in the thermocline over the last 50 years , superimposed on oscillations with time scales of a few years to two decades. Stendardo and Gruber  found dissolved oxygen decreases in upper water masses of the North Atlantic and increases in intermediate water masses. The changes were caused by changes in solubility as well as changes in ventilation and circulation over time. In contrast to the widely distributed oxygen declines, oxygen increased in the thermoclines of the Indian and South Pacific Oceans from the 1990s to the 2000s , apparently due to strengthened circulation driven by stronger winds . In the southern Indian Ocean below the thermocline, east of 75E, oxygen decreased between 1960 and 2010 most prominently on the isopycnals q = 26.9 to 27.0 .

FAQ 3.3 | How Does Anthropogenic Ocean Acidification Relate to Climate Change? Both anthropogenic climate change and anthropogenic ocean acidification are caused by increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. Rising levels of carbon dioxide , along with other greenhouse gases, indirectly alter the climate system by trapping heat as it is reflected back from the Earth's surface. Anthropogenic ocean acidification is a direct consequence of rising CO2 concentrations as seawater currently absorbs about 30% of the anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere. Ocean acidification refers to a reduction in pH over an extended period, typically decades or longer, caused primarily by the uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere. pH is a dimensionless measure of acidity. Ocean acidification describes the direction of pH change rather than the end point; that is, ocean pH is decreasing but is not expected to become acidic . Ocean acidification can also be caused by other chemical additions or subtractions from the oceans that are natural  or human-induced . Anthropogenic ocean acidification refers to the component of pH reduction that is caused by human activity. Since about 1750, the release of CO2 from industrial and agricultural activities has resulted in global average atmospheric CO2 concentrations that have increased from 278 to 390.5 ppm in 2011. The atmospheric concentration of CO2 is now higher than experienced on the Earth for at least the last 800,000 years and is expected to continue to rise because of our dependence on fossil fuels for energy. To date, the oceans have absorbed approximately 155  30 PgC from the atmosphere, which corresponds to roughly one-fourth of the total amount of CO2 emitted  by human activities since preindustrial times. This natural process of absorption has significantly reduced the greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere and minimized some of the impacts of global warming. However, the ocean's uptake of CO2 is having a significant impact on the chemistry of seawater. The average pH of ocean surface waters has already fallen by about 0.1 units, from about 8.2 to 8.1 since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Estimates of projected future atmospheric and oceanic CO2 concentrations indicate that, by the end of this century, the average surface ocean pH could be 0.2 to 0.4 lower than it is today. The pH scale is logarithmic, so a change of 1 unit corresponds to a 10-fold change in hydrogen ion concentration.	0
Hydrogen ions  are produced by these reactions. This increase in the ocean's hydrogen ion concentration corresponds to a reduction in pH, or an increase in acidity. Under normal seawater conditions, more than 99.99% of the hydrogen ions that are produced will combine with carbonate ion  to produce additional HCO3-. Thus, the addition of anthropogenic CO2 into the oceans lowers the pH and consumes carbonate ion. These reactions are fully reversible and the basic thermodynamics of these reactions in seawater are well known, such that at a pH of approximately 8.1 approximately 90% the carbon is in the form of bicarbonate ion, 9% in the form of carbonate ion, and only about 1% of the carbon is in the form of dissolved CO2. Results from laboratory, field, and modeling studies, as well as evidence from the geological record, clearly indicate that marine ecosystems are highly susceptible to the increases in oceanic CO2 and the corresponding decreases in pH and carbonate ion. Climate change and anthropogenic ocean acidification do not act independently. Although the CO2 that is taken up by the ocean does not contribute to greenhouse warming, ocean warming reduces the solubility of carbon dioxide in seawater; and thus reduces the amount of CO2 the oceans can absorb from the atmosphere. For example, under doubled preindustrial CO2 concentrations and a 2C temperature increase, seawater absorbs about 10% less CO2  than it would with no temperature increase , but the pH remains almost unchanged. Thus, a warmer ocean has less capacity to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, yet still experiences ocean acidification. The reason for this is that bicarbonate is converted to carbonate in a warmer ocean, releasing a hydrogen ion thus stabilizing the pH.  297	0
Coastal regions have also experienced long-term dissolved oxygen changes. Bograd et al.  reported a substantial reduction of the thermocline oxygen content in the southern part of the California Current from 1984 to 2002, resulting in a shoaling of the hypoxic boundary . Off the British Columbia coast, oxygen concentrations in the near bottom waters decreased an average of 1.1 mol kg-1 yr-1 over a 30-year period . These changes along the west coast of North America appear to have been largely caused by the open ocean dissolved oxygen decrease and local processes associated with decreased vertical dissolved oxygen transport following near-surface warming and increased stratification. Gilbert et al.  found evidence that for the time period 1976-2000 oxygen concentrations between 0 and 300 m depth were declining about 10 times faster in the coastal ocean 298	0

Satellite observations of chlorophyll reveal that oligotrophic provinces in four of the world's major oceans expanded at average rates of 0.8 to 4.3% yr-1 from 1998 to 2006 , consistent with a reduction in nutrient availability owing to increases in stratification. Model and observational studies suggest interannual and multi-decadal fluctuations in nutrients are coupled with variability of mode water and the NAO in the Atlantic Ocean , climate modes of variability in the Pacific Ocean , and variability of subtropical gyre circulation in the Indian Ocean . However, there are no published studies quantifying longterm trends in ocean nutrient concentrations.	0
Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 results in gradual acidification of the ocean. The pH of surface seawater has decreased by 0.1 since the beginning of the industrial era, corresponding to a 26% increase in hydrogen ion concentration. The observed pH trends range between -0.0014 and -0.0024 yr-1 in surface waters. In the ocean interior, natural physical and biological processes, as well as uptake of anthropogenic CO2, can cause changes in pH over decadal and longer time scales . High agreement among analyses provides medium confidence that oxygen concentrations have decreased in the open ocean thermocline in many ocean regions since the 1960s. The general decline is consistent with the expectation that warming-induced stratification leads to a decrease in the supply of oxygen to the thermocline from near surface	0
Changes have been observed in a number of ocean properties of relevance to climate. It is virtually certain that the upper ocean  has warmed from 1971 to 2010 . Warming between 700 and 2000 m likely contributed about 30% of the total increase in global ocean heat content between 1957 and 2009 . Global mean sea level has risen by 0.19  m over the period 1901-2010. It is very likely that the mean rate was 1.7  mm yr-1 between 1901 and 2010 and increased to 3.2  mm yr-1 between 1993 and 2010 . The rise in mean sea level can explain most of the observed increase in extreme sea levels . Regional trends in sea surface salinity have very likely enhanced the mean geographical contrasts in sea surface salinity since the 1950s: saline surface waters in evaporation-dominated regions have become more saline, while fresh surface waters in rainfall-dominated regions have become fresher. It is very likely that trends in salinity have also occurred in the ocean interior. These salinity changes provide indirect evidence that the pattern of evaporation minus precipitation over the oceans has been enhanced since the 1950s . Observed changes in water mass properties likely reflect the combined effect of long-term trends in surface forcing  and variability associated with climate modes . It is virtually certain that the ocean is storing anthropogenic CO2 and very likely that the ocean inventory of anthropogenic CO2 increased from 1994 to 2010 . The uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has very likely caused acidification of the ocean . For some ocean properties, the short and incomplete observational record is not sufficient to detect trends. For example, there is no observational evidence for or against a change in the strength of the AMOC . However, recent observations have strengthened evidence for variability in major ocean circulation systems and water mass properties on time scales from years to decades. Much of the variability observed in ocean currents and in water masses can be linked to changes in surface forcing, including wind changes associated with the major modes of climate variability such as the NAO, SAM, ENSO, PDO and the AMO . The consistency between the patterns of change in a number of independent ocean parameters enhances confidence in the assessment that the physical and biogeochemical state of the oceans has changed.	0
Current) result in large anomalies. Zonally averaged warming trends are widespread throughout the upper 2000 m, with largest warming near the sea surface. Water masses formed in the precipitationdominated mid to high latitudes have freshened, while water masses formed in the evaporation-dominated subtropics have become saltier. Anthropogenic CO2 has accumulated in surface waters and been transferred into the interior, primarily by water masses formed in the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans. In summary, changes have been observed in ocean properties of relevance to climate during the past 40 years, including temperature, salinity, sea level, carbon, pH, and oxygen. The observed patterns of change are consistent with changes in the surface ocean  in response to climate change and variability and with known physical and biogeochemical processes in the ocean, providing high confidence in this assessment. Chapter 10 discusses the extent to which these observed changes can be attributed to human or natural forcing.	0
Improvements in the quality and quantity of ocean observations has allowed for a more definitive assessment of ocean change than was possible in AR4. However, substantial uncertainties remain. In many cases, the observational record is still too short or incomplete to detect trends in the presence of energetic variability on time scales of years to decades. Recent improvements in the ocean observing system, most notably the Argo profiling float array, mean that temperature and salinity are now being sampled routinely in most of the ocean above 2000 m depth for the first time. However, sparse sampling of the deep ocean and of many biogeochemical variables continues to limit the ability to detect and understand changes in the global ocean.	0

Appendix 3.A: Availability of Observations for Assessment of Change in the Oceans Sampling of the ocean has been highly heterogeneous since 1950. The coverage in space, time, depth and number of ocean variables has evolved over time, reflecting changes in technology and the contribution of major oceanographic research programs. Changes in the distribution and quality of ocean measurements over time complicate efforts to detect and interpret change in the ocean. This Appendix provides some illustrative examples of the evolution of the ocean observing system on which the assessment of ocean change in this chapter is based. A more comprehensive discussion of ocean sampling is provided in the literature cited in this chapter. Sampling of sea surface temperature is discussed in Chapter 2.	0
Temperature is the best-sampled oceanographic variable, but even for temperature sampling is far from ideal or complete. Early oceanographic expeditions included the Challenger voyage around the world in the 1870s, the Meteor survey of the Atlantic in the 1920s, and the Discovery investigations of the Southern Ocean starting in the 1920s. More frequent basin-scale sampling commenced in the late 1950s with the International Geophysical Year. The number of profiles available for assessment of changes in temperature and ocean heat content in the upper 700 m generally increases with time since the 1950s . Near-global coverage of the upper half of the ocean was not achieved until the widespread deployment of Argo profiling floats in the 2000s .	0
Early measurements of temperature were made using reversing thermometers and Nansen bottles that were lowered from ships on station . Starting in the 1960s conductivity-temperature-depth  instruments with Niskin bottles gradually gained dominance for high-quality data and deep data collected on station during oceanographic cruises. From at least 1950 through about 1970, most subsurface measurements of ocean temperature were made with mechanical bathythermographs, an advance because these instruments could be deployed from a moving ship, albeit a slowly moving one, but these casts were generally limited to depths shallower than 250 m. Expendable bathythermographs  that could be deployed from a rapidly moving ship and sampled to 400 m came into widespread use in the late 1960s, and those that sampled to 700 m became predominant in the 1990s, greatly expanding oceanographic sampling. Starting in 2000, Argo floats began sampling the ocean to a target depth of 2000 m, building to near-global coverage by 2005. Prior to the Argo era, sampling of the ocean below 700 m was almost solely achieved from ships on station deploying Nansen bottles with reversing thermometers or later using CTDs with Niskin bottles. Today ship-based station data still dominates sampling for waters deeper than 2000 m depth . An illustration of the limited data available for assessment of change in the deep ocean is provided in Figure 3.3, which shows locations of full-depth oceanographic CTD sections that have been occupied more than once since about 1980. The depth coverage of the ocean observing system has changed over time  with a hemispheric bias . The Northern Hemisphere  has been consistently better sampled than the Southern Hemisphere  prior to the Argo era.	0
Measurements of subsurface salinity have relied almost solely on data collected from bottle and CTD casts from ships on station . Hence fewer measurements of salinity are available than of temperature . However, the evolution with time of subsurface salinity sampling shows a progression similar to that of temperature . Coverage generally improves with time, but there is a strong NH bias, particularly in the North Atlantic. A shift in focus from basin-to-basin as major field programs were carried out is evident. Near-global coverage of ocean salinity above 2000 m was not achieved until after 2005, when the Argo array approached full deployment. For depths greater than 2000 m, outside 312	0
Direct observations of sea level are made using tide gauges since the 1700s and high-precision satellite altimeters since 1992. Tide gauge measurements are limited to coastlines and islands. There are intermittent records of sea level at Amsterdam from 1700 and at three more sites in Northern Europe starting after 1770. By the late 1800s, more tide gauges were being operated in Northern Europe and in North America, as well as in Australia and New Zealand . It was not until the late 1970s to early 1980s that a majority of deepocean islands had operating tide gauges suitable for climate studies. Although tide gauges have continued to be deployed since 1990, they have been complemented by continuous, near-global measurements of sea level from space since 1992. Measurements are made along the satellite's ground track on the Earth surface, typically averaged over approximately 7 km to reduce noise and improve precision. The maximum latitude extent of the measurement is limited by the inclination of the orbital plane, which has been between 66 for the TOPEX/ Poseidon and Jason series of altimeters. The spacing between ground tracks is much greater than the spacing along the ground track. As an example, the groundtrack separation of the TOPEX/Poseidon-type of orbits is about 300 km at the equator, but is less than 100 km at latitudes poleward of 50 latitude. On average, the spacing is between 100 and 200 km. Satellites are limited in the temporal sampling as well due to the orbit configuration. For a specific location along a groundtrack, the return time for a TOPEX/Poseidon-type of orbit is 9.9 days. If one relaxes the requirement to a measurement within a 300 km radius, the return time can be as short as a few hours at high latitudes to about 3 days at the equator. As noted in Section 3.6, satellite altimeter observations of sea level are also an important tool for observing large-scale ocean circulation.	0
The data available for assessing changes in biogeochemical parameters is less complete than for temperature and salinity. The global data base on which the Global Ocean Data Analysis Project  ocean carbon inventory is based is illustrated in Figure 3.A.5. Changes in the ocean inventory of anthropogenic CO2 have been estimated using measurements of carbon parameters and other tracers collected at these roughly 12,000 stations, mostly occupied since 1990. The majority of these stations extend through the full water depth. A subset of these stations have been repeated one or more times. The distribution of oxygen measurements at 300 m depth in 10-year periods since 1960 is shown in Figure 3.A.6, as used in the global study of Stramma et al. . As for temperature and salinity, the sampling is heterogeneous, coverage generally improves with time but shifts between basins as major field programs come and go, and tends to be concentrated in the NH.	0
The cryosphere, comprising snow, river and lake ice, sea ice, glaciers, ice shelves and ice sheets, and frozen ground, plays a major role in the Earth's climate system through its impact on the surface energy budget, the water cycle, primary productivity, surface gas exchange and sea level. The cryosphere is thus a fundamental control on the physical, biological and social environment over a large part of the Earth's surface. Given that all of its components are inherently sensitive to temperature change over a wide range of time scales, the cryosphere is a natural integrator of climate variability and provides some of the most visible signatures of climate change. Since AR4, observational technology has improved and key time series of measurements have been lengthened, such that our identification and measurement of changes and trends in all components of the cryosphere has been substantially improved, and our understanding of the specific processes governing their responses has been refined. Since the AR4, observations show that there has been a continued net loss of ice from the cryosphere, although there are significant differences in the rate of loss between cryospheric components and regions. The major changes occurring to the cryosphere are as follows.	0
Sea Ice Continuing the trends reported in AR4, the annual Arctic sea ice extent decreased over the period 1979-2012. The rate of this decrease was very likely1 between 3.5 and 4.1% per decade . The average decrease in decadal extent of Arctic sea ice has been most rapid in summer and autumn , but the extent has decreased in every season, and in every successive decade since 1979 . The average winter sea ice thickness within the Arctic Basin decreased between 1980 and 2008 . The average decrease was likely between 1.3 and 2.3 m. High confidence in this assessment is based on observations from multiple sources: submarine, electro-magnetic  probes, and satellite altimetry, and is consistent with the decline in multi-year and perennial ice extent {4.2.2, Figures	0
The cryosphere is the collective term for the components of the Earth system that contain a substantial fraction of water in the frozen state . The cryosphere comprises several components: snow, river and lake ice; sea ice; ice sheets, ice shelves, glaciers and ice caps; and frozen ground which exist, both on land and beneath the oceans . The lifespan of each component is very different. River and lake ice, for example, are transient features that generally do not survive from winter to summer; sea ice advances and retreats with the seasons but especially in the Arctic can survive to become multi-year ice lasting several years. The East Antarctic ice sheet, on the other hand, is believed to have become relatively stable around 14 million years ago . Nevertheless, all components of the cryosphere are inherently sensitive to changes in air temperature and precipitation, and hence to a changing climate .	0
The cryosphere is, however, not simply a passive indicator of climate change; changes in each component of the cryosphere have a significant and lasting impact on physical, biological and social systems. Ice sheets and glaciers exert a major control on global sea level , ice loss from these systems may affect global ocean circulation and marine ecosystems, and the loss of glaciers near populated areas as well as changing seasonal snow cover may have direct impacts on water resources and tourism . Similarly, reduced sea ice extent has altered, and in the future may continue to alter, ocean circulation, ocean productivity and regional climate and will have direct impacts on shipping and mineral and oil exploration . Furthermore, decline in snow cover and sea ice will tend to amplify regional warming through snow and ice-albedo feedback effects . In addition,	0

changes in frozen ground  will damage some vulnerable Arctic infrastructure , and could substantially alter the carbon budget through the release of methane . Since AR4, substantial progress has been made in most types of cryospheric observations. Satellite technologies now permit estimates of regional and temporal changes in the volume and mass of the ice sheets. The longer time series now available enable more accurate assessments of trends and anomalies in sea ice cover and rapid identification of unusual events such as the dramatic decline of Arctic summer sea ice extent in 2007 and 2012. Similarly, Arctic sea ice thickness can now be estimated using satellite altimetry, allowing pan-Arctic measurements of changes in volume and mass. A new global glacier inventory includes nearly all glaciers   and allows for much better estimates of the total ice volume and its past and future changes. Remote sensing measurements of regional glacier volume change are also now available widely and modelling of glacier mass change has improved considerably. Finally, fluctuations in the cryosphere in the distant and recent past have been mapped with increasing certainty, demonstrating the potential for rapid ice loss, compared to slow recovery, particularly when related to sea level rise. This chapter describes the current state of the cryosphere and its individual components, with a focus on recent improvements in understanding of the observed variability, changes and trends. Projections of future cryospheric changes  and potential drivers  are discussed elsewhere. Earlier IPCC reports used cryospheric terms that have specific scientific meanings , but have rather different meanings in everyday language. To avoid confusion, this chapter uses the term `glaciers' for what was previously termed `glaciers and ice caps' . For the two largest ice masses of continental size, those covering Greenland and Antarctica, we use the term `ice sheets'. For simplicity, we use units such as gigatonnes . One gigatonne is approximately equal to one cubic kilometre of freshwater , and 362.5 Gt of ice removed from the land and immersed in the oceans will cause roughly 1 mm of global sea level rise .	0
Sea ice  is an important component of the climate system. A sea ice cover on the ocean changes the surface albedo, insulates the ocean from heat loss, and provides a barrier to the exchange of momentum and gases such as water vapour and CO2 between the ocean and atmosphere. Salt ejected by growing sea ice alters the density structure and modifies the circulation of the ocean. Regional climate changes affect the sea ice characteristics and these changes can feed back on the climate system, both regionally and globally. Sea ice is also a major component of polar ecosystems; plants and animals at all trophic levels find a habitat in, or are associated with, sea ice. Most sea ice exists as pack ice, and wind and ocean currents drive the drift of individual pieces of ice . Divergence and shear in	0
sea ice motion create areas of open water where, during colder months, new ice can quickly form and grow. On the other hand, convergent ice motion causes the ice cover to thicken by deformation. Two relatively thin floes colliding with each other can `raft', stacking one on top of the other and thickening the ice. When thicker floes collide, thick ridges may be built from broken pieces, with a height above the surface  of 2 m or more, and a much greater thickness  and width below the ocean surface . Sea ice thickness also increases by basal freezing during winter months. But the thicker the ice becomes the more it insulates heat loss from the ocean to the atmosphere and the slower the basal growth is. There is an equilibrium thickness for basal ice growth that is dependent on the surface energy balance and heat from the deep ocean below. Snow cover lying on the surface of sea ice provides additional insulation, and also alters the surface albedo and aerodynamic roughness. But also, and particularly in the Antarctic, a heavy snow load on thin sea ice can depress the ice surface and allow seawater to flood the snow. This saturated snow layer freezes quickly to form `snow ice' . Because sea ice is formed from seawater it contains sea salt, mostly in small pockets of concentrated brine. The total salt content in newly formed sea ice is only 25 to 50% of that in the parent seawater, and the residual salt rejected as the sea ice forms alters ocean water density and stability. The salinity of the ice decreases as it ages, and particularly during the Arctic summer when melt water  drains through and flushes the ice. The salinity and porosity of sea ice affect its mechanical strength, its thermal properties and its electrical properties - the latter being very important for remote sensing. Geographical constraints play a dominant but not an exclusive role in determining the quite different characteristics of sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic . This is one of the reasons why changes in sea ice extent and thickness are very different in the north and the south. We also have much more information on Arctic sea ice thickness than we do on Antarctic sea ice thickness, and so discuss Arctic and Antarctic separately in this assessment.	0
Regional sea ice observations, which span more than a century, have revealed significant interannual changes in sea ice coverage . Since the advent of satellite multichannel passive microwave imaging systems in 1979, which now provide more than 34 years of continuous coverage, it has been possible to monitor the entire extent of sea ice with a temporal resolution of less than a day. A number of procedures have been used to convert the observed microwave brightness temperature into sea ice concentration-- the fractional area of the ocean covered by ice--and thence to derive sea ice extent and area . Sea ice extent is defined as the sum of ice covered areas with concentrations of at least 15%, while ice area is the product of the ice concentration and area of each data element within the ice extent. A brief description of the different techniques for deriving sea ice concentration is provided in the Supplementary Material. The trends in the sea ice concentration, ice extent and ice area, as inferred from data 323	0
derived from the different techniques, are generally compatible. A comparison of derived ice extents from different sources is presented in the next section and in the Supplementary Material. Results presented in this assessment are based primarily on a single technique  but the use of data from other techniques would provide generally the same conclusions. Arctic sea ice cover varies seasonally, with average ice extent varying between about 6 x 106 km2 in the summer and about 15 x 106 km2 in the winter . The summer ice cover is confined to mainly the Arctic Ocean basin and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, while winter sea ice reaches as far south as 44N, into the peripheral seas. At the end of summer, the Arctic sea ice cover consists primarily of the previously thick, old and ridged ice types that survived the melt period. Interannual variability is largely determined by the extent of the ice cover in the peripheral seas in winter and by the ice cover that survives the summer melt in the Arctic Basin.	0
Figure 4.2  shows both the seasonality of the Arctic sea ice cover and the large decadal changes that have occurred over the last 34 years. Typically, Arctic sea ice reaches its maximum seasonal extent in February or March whereas the minimum occurs in September at the end of summer melt. Changes in decadal averages in Arctic ice extent are more pronounced in summer than in winter. The change in winter extent between 1979-1988 and 1989-1998 was negligible. Between 1989-1998 and 1999-2008, there was a decrease in winter extent of around 0.6 x 106 km2. This can be contrasted to a decrease in ice extent at the end of the summer  of 0.5 x 106 km2 between 1979-1988 and 1989-1998, followed by a further decrease of 1.2 x 106 km2 between 1989-1998 and 1999-2008. Figure 4.2 also shows that the change in extent from 1979-1988 to 1989-1998 was statistically significant mainly in spring and summer while the change from 1989-1998 to 1999-2008 was statistically significant during winter and summer. The largest interannual changes occur during the end of summer when only the thick components of the winter ice cover survive the summer melt . For comparison, the average extents during the 2009-2012 period are also presented: the extent during this period was considerably less than in earlier periods in all seasons, except spring. The summer minimum extent was at a record low in 2012 following an earlier record set in 2007 . The minimum ice extent in 2012 was 3.44 x 106 km2 while the low in 2007 was 4.22 x 106 km2. For comparison, the record high value was 7.86 x 106 km2 in 1980. The low extent in 2012  was probably caused in part by an unusually strong storm in the Central Arctic Basin on 4 to 8 August 2012 . The extents for 2007 and 2012 were almost the same from June until the storm period in 2012, after which the extent in 2012 started to trend considerably lower than in 2007. The error bars, which represent 1 standard deviation  of samples used to estimate each data point, are smallest in the first decade and get larger with subsequent decades indicating much higher interannual variability in recent years. The error 324	0
bars are also comparable in summer and winter during the first decade but become progressively larger for summer compared to winter in subsequent decades. These results indicate that the largest interannual variability has occurred in the summer and in the recent decade. Although relatively short as a climate record, the 34-year satellite record is long enough to allow determination of significant and consistent trends of the time series of monthly anomalies  of ice extent, area and concentration. The trends in ice concentration for the winter, spring, summer and autumn for the period November 1978 to December 2012 are shown in Figure 4.2 . The seasonal trends for different regions, except the Bering Sea, are negative. Ice cover changes are relatively large in the eastern Arctic Basin and most peripheral seas in winter and spring, while changes are pronounced almost everywhere in the Arctic Basin, except at greater than 82N, in summer and autumn. In connection with a comprehensive observational research program during the International Polar Year 2007-2008, regional studies primarily on the Canadian side of the Arctic revealed very similar patterns of spatial and interannual variability of the sea ice cover . From the monthly anomaly data, the trend in sea ice extent in the Northern Hemisphere  for the period from November 1978 to December 2012 is -3.8  0.3% per decade  . The error quoted is calculated from the standard deviation of the slope of the regression line. The baseline for the monthly anomalies is the average of all data for each month from November 1978 to December 2012. The trends for different regions vary greatly, ranging from +7.3% per decade in the Bering Sea to -13.8% per decade in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This large spatial variability is associated with the complexity of the atmospheric and oceanic circulation system as manifested in the Arctic Oscillation . The trends also differ with season . For the entire NH, the trends in ice extent are -2.3  0.5%, -1.8  0.5%, -6.1  0.8% and -7.0  1.5% per decade  in winter, spring, summer and autumn, respectively. The corresponding trends in ice area are -2.8  0.5%, -2.2  0.5%, -7.2  1.0%, and -7.8  1.3% per decade . Similar results were obtained by  but cannot be compared directly since their data are for the period from 1979 to 2010 . The trends for ice extent and ice area are comparable except in the summer and autumn, when the trend in ice area is significantly more than that in ice extent. This is due in part to increasing open water areas within the pack that may be caused by more frequent storms and more divergence in the summer . The trends are larger in the summer and autumn mainly because of the rapid decline in the multi-year ice cover , as discussed in Section 4.2.2.3. The trends in km2 yr-1 were estimated as in Comiso and Nishio  and Comiso  but the percentage trends presented in this chapter were calculated differently. Here the percentage is calculated as a difference from the first data point on the trend line whereas the earlier estimations used the difference from the mean value. The new percentage trends are only slightly different from the previous ones and the conclusions about changes are the same.	0
terrestrial proxies . The records constructed by Kinnard et al.  and Macias Fauria et al.  suggest that the decline of sea ice over the last few decades has been unprecedented over the past 1450 years . In a study of the marginal seas near the Russian coastline using ice extent data from 1900 to 2000, Polyakov et al.  found a low frequency multi-decadal oscillation near the Kara Sea that shifted to a dominant decadal oscillation in the Chukchi Sea. A more comprehensive basin-wide record, compiled by Walsh and Chapman , showed very little interannual variability until the last three to four decades. For the period 1901 to 1998, their results show a summer mode that includes an anomaly of the same sign over nearly the entire Arctic and that captures the sea-ice trend from recent satellite data. Figure 4.3 shows an updated record of the Walsh and Chapman data set with longer time coverage  that is more robust because it includes additional historical sea ice observations . A comparison of this updated data set with that originally reported by Walsh and Chapman  shows similar interannual variability that is dominated by a nearly constant extent of the winter  and autumn  ice cover from 1870 to the 1950s. The absence of interannual variability during that period is due to the use of climatology to fill gaps, potentially masking the natural signal. Sea ice data from 1900-2011 as compiled by Met Office Hadley Centre are also plotted for comparison. In this data set, the 1979-2011 values were derived from various sources, including satellite data, as described by Rayner et al. . Since the 1950s, more in situ data are available and have been homogenized with the satellite record . These data show a consistent decline in the sea ice cover that is relatively moderate during the winter but more dramatic during the summer months. Satellite data from other sources are also plotted in Figure 4.3, including Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer  and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager  data using the Bootstrap Algorithm  as described by Comiso and Nishio  and National Aeronautics and Space Administration  Team Algorithm  as described by Cavalieri et al.  . Data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System  using the Bootstrap Algorithm  and the NASA Team Algorithm Version 2  are also presented. The error bars represent one standard deviation of the interannual variability during the satellite period. Because of the use of climatology to fill data gaps from 1870 to 1953, the error bars in the Walsh and Chapman data were set to twice that of the satellite period and 1.5 times higher for 1954 to 1978. The apparent reduction of the sea ice extent from 1978 to 1979 is in part due to the change from surface observations to satellite data. Generally, the temporal distributions from the various sources are consistent with some exceptions that may be attributed to possible errors in the data . Taking this into account, the various sources provide similar basic information and conclusions about the changing extent and variability of the Arctic sea ice cover.	0
ice area were strongly negative at -11.5  2.1 and -12.5  2.1% per decade  respectively. These values indicate an increased rate of decline from the -6.4% and -8.5% per decade, respectively, reported for the 1979 to 2000 period by Comiso . The trends in multi-year ice extent and area are even more negative, at -13.5  2.5 and -14.7  3.0% per decade , respectively, as updated for the period 1979 to 2012 . The more negative trend in ice area than in ice extent indicates that the average ice concentration of multi-year ice in the Central Arctic has also been declining. The rate of decline in the extent and area of multi-year ice cover is consistent with the observed decline of old ice types from the analysis of ice drift and ice age by Maslanik et al. , confirming that older and thicker ice types in the Arctic have been declining significantly. The more negative trend for the thicker multi-year ice area than that for the perennial ice area implies that the average thickness of the ice, and hence the ice volume, has also been declining. Drastic changes in the multi-year ice coverage from QuikScat  data, validated using high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar data , have also been reported. Some of these changes have been attributed to the near zero replenishment of the Arctic multi-year ice cover by ice that survives the summer .	0

Annual ice extent and  seasonal ice extent using averages of mid-month values derived from in situ and other sources including observations from the Danish meteorological stations from 1870 to 1978 . Ice extent from a joint Hadley and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  project  from 1900 to 2011 is also shown. The yearly and seasonal averages for the period from 1979 to 2011 are shown as derived from Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer  and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager  passive microwave data using the Bootstrap Algorithm  and National Aeronautics and Space Administration  Team Algorithm, Version 1 , using procedures described in Comiso and Nishio , and Cavalieri et al. , respectively; and from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer, Version 2  using algorithms called AMSR Bootstrap Algorithm  and NASA Team Algorithm, Version 2 , described in Comiso and Nishio  and Markus and Cavalieri .

1979-2012 are shown in Figure 4.4. Perennial ice is that which survives the summer, and the ice extent at summer minimum has been used as a measure of its coverage . Multi-year ice  is ice that has survived at least two summers. Generally, multi-year ice is less saline and has a distinct microwave signature that differs from the seasonal ice, and thus can be discriminated and monitored with satellite microwave radiometers . Figure 4.4 shows similar interannual variability and large trends for both perennial and multi-year ice for the period 1979 to 2012. The extent of the perennial ice cover, which was about 7.9 x 106 km2 in 1980, decreased to as low as 3.5 x 106 km2 in 2012. Similarly, the multi-year ice extent decreased from about 6.2 x 106 km2 in 1981 to about 2.5 x 106 km2 in 2012. The trends in perennial ice extent and 326	0
4.2.2.4 Ice Thickness and Volume For the Arctic, there are several techniques available for estimating the thickness distribution of sea ice. Combined data sets of draft and thickness from submarine sonars, satellite altimetry and airborne electromagnetic sensing provide broadly consistent and strong evidence of decrease in Arctic sea ice thickness in recent years . Data collected by upward-looking sonar on submarines operating beneath the Arctic pack ice provided the first evidence of `basin-wide' decreases in ice thickness . Sonar measurements are of average draft , which is converted to thickness by assuming an average density for the measured floe including its snow cover. With the then available submarine records, Rothrock et al.  found that ice draft in the mid-1990s was less than that measured between 1958 and 1977 in each of six regions within the Arctic Basin. The change was least  in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas and greatest  in the Eurasian Basin. The decrease averaged about 42% of the average 1958 to 1977 thickness. This decrease matched the decline measured in the Eurasian Basin between 1976 and 1996 using UK submarine data , which was 43%. A subsequent analysis of US Navy submarine ice draft  used much richer and more geographically extensive data from 34 cruises within a data release area that covered almost 38% of the area of the Arctic Ocean. These cruises were equally distributed in spring and autumn over a 25-year period between 1975 and 2000. Observational uncertainty associated with the ice draft from these is 0.5 m . Multiple regression analysis was used to separate the interannual changes , the annual cycle and the spatial distribution of draft in the observations. Results of that analysis show that the annual mean ice thickness declined from a peak of 3.6 m in 1980 to 2.4 m in 2000, a decrease of 1.2 m. Over the period, the most rapid change was -0.08 m yr-1 in 1990. The most recent submarine record, Wadhams et al. , found that tracks north of Greenland repeated between the winters of 2004 and 2007 showed a continuing shift towards less multi-year ice. Satellite altimetry techniques are now capable of mapping sea ice freeboard to provide relatively comprehensive pictures of the distribution of Arctic sea ice thickness. Similar to the estimation of sea ice thickness from ice draft, satellite measured freeboard  is converted to thickness, assuming an average density of ice and snow. The principal challenges to accurate thickness estimation using satellite altimetry are in the discrimination of ice and open water, and in estimating the thickness of the snow cover. Since 1993, radar altimeters on the European Space Agency , European Remote Sensing  and Envisat satellites have provided Arctic observations south of 81.5N. With the limited latitudinal reach of these altimeters, however, it has been difficult to infer basin-wide changes in thickness. The ERS-1 estimates of ice thickness show a downward trend but, because of the high variability and short time series , Laxon et al.  concluded that the trend in a region of mixed seasonal and multi-year ice  cannot	0
be considered as significant. Envisat observations showed a large decrease in thickness  following September 2007 when ice extent was the second lowest on record . This was associated with the large retreat of the summer ice cover, with thinning regionally confined to the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, but with no significant changes in the eastern Arctic. These results are consistent with those from the NASA Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite  laser altimeter , which show thinning in the same regions between 2007 and 2008  . Large decreases in thickness due to the 2007 minimum in summer ice are clearly seen in both the radar and laser altimeter thickness estimates. The coverage of the laser altimeter on ICESat  extended to 86N and provided a more complete spatial pattern of the thickness distribution in the Arctic Basin . Thickness estimates are consistently within 0.5 m of sonar measurements from near-coincident submarine tracks and profiles from sonar moorings in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas . Ten ICESat campaigns between autumn 2003 and spring 2008 showed seasonal differences in thickness and thinning and volume losses of the Arctic Ocean ice cover . Over these campaigns, the multi-year sea ice thickness in spring declined by ~0.6 m , while the average thickness of the first-year ice  had a negligible trend. The average sea ice volume inside the Arctic Basin in spring  was ~14,000 km3. Between 2004 and 2008, the total multi-year ice volume in spring  experienced a net loss of 6300 km3 . Residual differences between sonar mooring and satellite thicknesses suggest basin-scale volume uncertainties of approximately 700 km3. The rate of volume loss  during autumn , while highlighting the large changes during the short ICESat record compares with a more moderate loss rate  over a 31-year period  estimated from a sea ice reanalysis study using the Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modelling and Assimilation system . The CryoSat-2 radar altimeter , which provides coverage up to 89N, has provided new thickness and volume estimates of Arctic Ocean sea ice . These show that the ice volume inside the Arctic Basin decreased by a total of 4291 km3 in autumn  and 1479 km3 in winter  between the ICESat  and CryoSat-2  periods. Based on ice thickness estimates from sonar moorings, an inter-satellite bias between ICESat and CryoSat-2 of 700 km3 can be expected. This is much less than the change in volume between the two periods. Airborne electro-magnetic  sounding measures the distance between an EM instrument near the surface or on an aircraft and the ice/water interface, and provides another method to measure ice thickness. Uncertainties in these thickness estimates are 0.1 m over level ice. Comparison with drill-hole measurements over a mix of level and ridged ice found differences of 0.17 m . Repeat EM surveys in the Arctic, though restricted in time and space, have provided a regional view of the changing ice cover. From repeat ground-based and helicopter-borne EM surveys, Haas et al.  found significant thinning in the region of the Transpolar Drift 	0
Between 1991 and 2004, the modal ice thickness decreased from 2.5 m to 2.2 m, with a larger decline to 0.9 m in 2007. Mean ice thicknesses also decreased strongly. This thinning was associated with reduction of the Greenland age of the ice, and replacement of second-year ice by first-year ice in 2007  as seen in satellite observations. Ice thickness estimates from EM surveys near the North Pole can be compared to submarine estimates . Airborne EM measurements from the Lincoln Sea between 83N and 84N since 2004  showed some of the thickest ice in the Arctic, with mean and modal thicknesses of more than 4.5 m and 4 m, respectively. Since 2008, the modal thickness in this region has declined to 3.5 m, which is most likely related to the narrowing of the remaining band of old ice along the northern coast of Canada.	0
Drifting buoys have been used to measure Arctic sea ice motion since 1979. From the record of buoy drift archived by the International Arctic Buoy Programme, Rampal et al.  found an increase in average drift speed between 1978 and 2007 of 17  4.5% per decade in winter and 8.5  2.0% per decade in summer. Using daily satellite ice motion fields, which provide a basin-wide picture of the ice drift, Spreen et al.  found that, between 1992 and 2008, the spatially averaged FM08 winter ice drift speed increased by 10.6  0.9% per decade, but varied regionally between -4 and +16% per decade . Increases in drift speed are seen over much of the Arctic except in areas with thicker ice . The largest increases occurred during the second half of the period , coinciding with the years of rapid ice thinning discussed in Section 4.2.2.4. Both Rampal et al.  and Spreen et al.  suggest that, since atmospheric reanalyses do not show stronger winds, the positive trend in drift speed is probably due to a weaker and thinner ice cover, especially during the period after 2003.	0
Ice motion influences the distribution of sea ice thickness in the Arctic Basin: locally, through deformation and creation of open water areas; regionally, through advection of ice from one area to another; and basin-wide, through export of ice from polar seas to lower latitudes where it melts. The drift and deformation of sea ice is forced primarily by winds and surface currents, but depends also on ice strength, top and bottom surface roughness, and ice concentration. On time scales of days to weeks, winds are responsible for most of the variance in sea ice motion.	0
In addition to freezing and melting, sea ice export through Fram Strait is a major component of the Arctic Ocean ice mass balance. Approximately10% of the area of Arctic Ocean ice is exported annually. Over a 32-year satellite record , the mean annual outflow of ice area through Fram Strait was 699  112 x 103 km2 with a peak during the 1994-1995 winter , but with no significant decadal trend. Decadal trends in ice volume export--a more definitive measure of change--is far less certain owing to the lack of an extended record of the thickness of sea ice exported through Fram	0
Strait. Comparison of volume outflow using ICESat thickness estimates  with earlier estimates by Kwok and Rothrock  and Vinje  using thicknesses from moored upward looking sonars shows no discernible change. Between 2005 and 2008, more than a third of the thicker and older sea ice loss occurred by transport of thick, multi-year ice, typically found west of the Canadian Archipelago, into the southern Beaufort Sea, where it melted in summer . Uncertainties remain in the relative contributions of in-basin melt and export to observed changes in Arctic ice volume loss, and it has also been shown that export of thicker ice through Nares Strait could account for a small fraction of the loss .	0
4.2.2.7 Arctic Polynyas High sea ice production in coastal polynyas  over the continental shelves of the Arctic Ocean is responsible for the formation of cold saline water, which contributes to the maintenance of the Arctic Ocean halocline . A new passive microwave algorithm has been used to estimate thin sea ice thicknesses  in the Arctic Ocean , providing the first circumpolar mapping of sea ice production in coastal polynyas. High sea ice production is confined to the most persistent Arctic coastal polynyas, with the highest ice production rate being in the North Water Polynya. The mean annual sea ice production in the 10 major Arctic polynyas is estimated to be 2942  373 km3 and decreased by 462 km3 between 1992 and 2007 .	0
4.2.2.8 Arctic Land-Fast Ice Seasonality collectively describes the annual time of sea ice advance and retreat, and its duration . Daily satellite ice-concentration records  are used to determine the day to which sea ice advanced, and the day from which it retreated, for each satellite pixel location. Maps of the timing of sea ice advance, retreat and duration are derived from these data  and Stammerjohn et al.  for detailed methods). Most regions in the Arctic show trends towards shorter ice season duration. One of the most rapidly changing areas  extends from the East Siberian Sea to the western Beaufort Sea. Here, between 1979 and 2011, sea ice advance occurred 41  6 days later , sea ice retreat 49  7 days earlier , and duration became 90  16 days shorter  . This 3-month lengthening of the summer ice-free season places Arctic summer sea ice extent loss into a seasonal perspective and underscores impacts to the marine ecosystem . The timing of surface melt onset in spring, and freeze-up in autumn, can be derived from satellite microwave data as the emissivity of the surface changes significantly with snow melt . The amount of solar energy absorbed by the ice cover increases with the length of the melt season. Longer melt seasons with lower albedo surfaces  increase absorption of incoming shortwave radiation and ice melt . Hudson  estimates that the observed reduction in Arctic sea ice has contributed approximately 0.1 W m-2 of additional global radiative forcing, and that an ice-free summer Arctic Ocean will result in a forcing of about 0.3 W m-2. The satellite record  shows a trend toward earlier melt and later freeze-up nearly everywhere in the Arctic . Over the last 34 years, the mean melt season over the Arctic ice cover has	0
Shore- or land-fast ice is sea ice attached to the coast. Land-fast ice along the Arctic coast is usually grounded in shallow water, with the seaward edge typically around the 20 to 30 m isobath . In fjords and confined bays, land-fast ice extends into deeper water. There are no reliable estimates of the total area or interannual variability of land-fast ice in the Arctic. However, both significant and non-significant trends have been observed regionally. Long-term monitoring near Hopen, Svalbard, revealed thinning of land-fast ice in the Barents Sea region by 11 cm per decade between 1966 and 2007 . Between 1936 and 2000, the trends in land-fast ice thickness  at four Siberian sites  are insignificant . A more recent composite time series of land-fast ice thickness between the mid 1960s and early 2000s from 15 stations along the Siberian coast revealed an average rate of thinning of 0.33 cm yr-1. End-of-winter ice thickness for three stations in the Canadian Arctic reveal a small downward trend at Eureka, a small positive trend at Resolute Bay, and a negligible trend at Cambridge Bay , but these trends are small and not statistically significant. Even though the trend in the land-fast ice extent near Barrow, Alaska has not been significant , relatively recent observations by Mahoney et al.  and Druckenmiller et al.  found longer ice-free seasons and thinner land-fast ice compared to earlier records . As freeze-up happens later, the growth season shortens and the thinner ice breaks up and melts earlier.	0
commenced. The data set is robust with continuous and consistent global coverage on a daily basis thereby providing very reliable trend results . The annual Arctic sea ice cover very likely declined within the range 3.5 to 4.1% per decade  during the period 1979-2012 with larger changes occurring in summer and autumn . Much larger changes apply to the perennial ice  which very likely decreased in the range from 9.4 % to 13.6 % per decade  and multiyear sea ice  which very likely declined in the range from 11.0 % to 16.0% per decade  . The rate of decrease in ice area has been greater than that in extent  because the ice concentration has also decreased. The decline in multiyear ice cover as observed by QuikScat from 1992 to 1910 is presented in Figure 4.6b and shown to be consistent with passive microwave data .	0
The decrease in perennial and multi-year ice coverage has resulted in a strong decrease in ice thickness, and hence in ice volume. Declassified submarine sonar measurements, covering ~38% of the Arctic Ocean, indicate an overall mean winter thickness of 3.64 m in 1980, which likely decreased by 1.8  m by 2008 . Between 1975 and 2000, the steepest rate of decrease was 0.08 m yr-1 in 1990 compared to a slightly higher winter/summer rate of 0.10/0.20 m yr-1 in the 5-year ICESat record . This combined analysis  shows a long-term trend of sea ice thinning that spans five decades. Satellite measurements made in the period 2010-2012 show a decrease in basin-scale sea ice volume compared to those made over the period 2003-2008 . The Arctic sea ice is becoming increasingly seasonal with thinner ice, and it will take several years for any recovery. The decreases in both concentration and thickness reduces sea ice strength reducing its resistance to wind forcing, and drift speed has increased  . Other significant changes to the Arctic Ocean sea ice include lengthening in the duration of the surface melt on perennial ice of 6 days per decade  and a nearly 3-month lengthening of the ice-free season in the region from the East Siberian Sea to the western Beaufort Sea.	0
The Antarctic sea ice cover is largely seasonal, with average extent varying from a minimum of about 3 x 106 km2 in February to a maximum of about 18 x 106 km2 in September . The relatively small fraction of Antarctic sea ice that survives the summer is found mostly in the Weddell Sea, but with some perennial ice also surviving on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula and in small patches around the coast. As well as being mostly first-year ice, Antarctic sea ice is also on average thinner, warmer, more saline and more mobile than Arctic ice . These characteristics, which reduce the capabilities of some remote sensing techniques, together with its more distant location from inhabited continents, result in far less being known about the properties of Antarctic sea ice than of that in the Arctic.	0
4.2.3.1 Total Antarctic Sea Ice Extent and Concentration Figure 4.7a shows the seasonal variability of Antarctic sea ice extent using 34 years of satellite passive microwave data updated from Comiso and Nishio . In contrast to the Arctic, decadal monthly averages almost overlap with each other, and the seasonal variability of the total Antarctic sea ice cover has not changed much over the period. In winter, the values for the 1999-2008 decade were slightly higher than those of the other decades; whereas in autumn the values for 1989-1998 and 1999-2008 decades were higher than those of 1979-1988. There was more seasonal variability in the period 2009- 2012 than for earlier decadal periods, with relatively high values in late autumn, winter and spring. Trend maps for winter, spring, summer and autumn extent are presented in Figure 4.7 . The seasonal trends are significant mainly near the ice edge, with the values alternating between positive and negative around Antarctica. Such an alternating pattern is similar to that described previously as the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave   but the ACW may not be associated with the trends because the trends have been strongly positive in the Ross Sea and negative in the Bellingshausen/Amundsen seas but with almost no trend in the other regions . In the winter, negative trends are evident at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and the western part of the Weddell Sea, while positive trends are prevalent in the Ross Sea. The patterns in spring are very similar to those of winter, whereas in summer and autumn negative trends are mainly confined to the Bellingshausen/Amundsen seas, while positive trends are dominant in the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea. The regression trend in the monthly anomalies of Antarctic sea ice extent from November 1978 to December 2012  is slightly positive, at 1.5  0.3% per decade, or 0.13 to 0.20 million km2 per decade  . The seasonal trends in ice extent are 1.2  0.5%, 1.0  0.5%, 2.5  2.0% and 3.0  2.0% per decade  in winter, spring, summer and autumn, respectively, as updated from Comiso et al. . The corresponding trends in ice area  are 1.9  0.7%, 1.6  0.5%, 3.0  2.1%, and 4.4  2.3% per decade . The values are all positive, with the largest trends occurring in the autumn. The trends are consistently higher for ice area than ice extent, indicating less open water  within the pack in later years. Trends reported by Parkinson and Cavalieri  using data from 1978 to 2010 are slightly different, in part because they cover a different time period . The overall interannual trends for various sectors around Antarctica are given in FAQ 4.1, and show large regional variability. Changes in ice drift and wind patterns as reported by Holland and Kwok  may be related to this phenomenon.	0

Using a 19-year data set  of satellite-tracked sea ice motion, Holland and Kwok  found large and statistically significant decadal trends in Antarctic ice drift that in most sectors are caused by changes in local winds. These trends suggest acceleration of the wind-driven Ross Gyre and deceleration of the Weddell Gyre. The changes in meridional ice transport affect the freshwater budget near the Antarctic coast. This is consistent with the increase of 30,000 km2 yr-1 in the net area export of sea ice from the Ross Sea shelf coastal polynya region between 1992 and 2008 . Assuming an annual average thickness of 0.6 m, Comiso et al.  estimated an increase in volume export of 20 km3 yr-1 which is similar to the rate of production in the Ross Sea coastal polynya region for the same period discussed in Section 4.2.3.5.	0
which routine observations of sea ice and snow properties were made. Their compilation included a gridded data set that reflects the regional differences in sea ice thickness. A subset of these ship observations, and ice charts, was used by DeLiberty et al.  to estimate the annual cycle of sea ice thickness and volume in the Ross Sea, and to investigate the relationship between ice thickness and extent. They found that maximum sea ice volume was reached later than maximum extent. While ice is advected to the northern edge and melts, the interior of the sea ice zone is supplied with ice from higher latitudes and continues to thicken by thermodynamic growth and deformation. Satellite retrievals of sea ice freeboard and thickness in the Antarctic  are under 332	0
In the Antarctic there are regionally different patterns of strong change in ice duration . In the northeast and west Antarctic Peninsula and southern Bellingshausen Sea region, later ice advance , earlier retreat  and shorter duration  occurred over the period 1979/1980-2010/2011 . These changes have strong impacts on the marine ecosystem . The opposite is true in the adjacent western Ross Sea, where substantial lengthening of the ice season of 79  12 days has occurred  due to earlier advance  and later retreat . Patterns of change in the relatively narrow East Antarctic sector are generally of a lower magnitude and zonally complex, but in certain regions involve changes in the timing of sea ice advance and retreat of the order of 1 to 2 days yr-1  .	0
4.2.3.5 Antarctic Polynyas Polynyas are commonly found along the coast of Antarctica. There are two different processes that cause a polynya. Warm water upwelling keeps the surface water near the freezing point and reduces ice production , and wind or ocean currents move ice away and increase further ice production . An increase in the extent of coastal polynyas in the Ross Sea caused increased ice production  that is primarily responsible for the positive trend in ice extent in the Antarctic . Drucker et al.  show that in the Ross Sea, the net ice export equals the annual ice production in the Ross Sea polynya , and that ice production increased by 20 km3 yr-1 from 1992 to 2008. However, the ice production in the Weddell Sea, which is three times less, has had no statistically significant	0
FAQ 4.1 | How Is Sea Ice Changing in the Arctic and Antarctic? The sea ice covers on the Arctic Ocean and on the Southern Ocean around Antarctica have quite different characteristics, and are showing different changes with time. Over the past 34 years , there has been a downward trend of 3.8% per decade in the annual average extent of sea ice in the Arctic. The average winter thickness of Arctic Ocean sea ice has thinned by approximately 1.8 m between 1978 and 2008, and the total volume  of Arctic sea ice has decreased at all times of year. The more rapid decrease in the extent of sea ice at the summer minimum is a consequence of these trends. In contrast, over the same 34-year period, the total extent of Antarctic sea ice shows a small increase of 1.5% per decade, but there are strong regional differences in the changes around the Antarctic. Measurements of Antarctic sea ice thickness are too few to be able to judge whether its total volume  is decreasing, steady, or increasing. A large part of the total Arctic sea ice cover lies above 60N  and is surrounded by land to the south with openings to the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and the Bering, Barents and Greenland seas. Some of the ice within the Arctic Basin survives for several seasons, growing in thickness by freezing of seawater at the base and by deformation . Seasonal sea ice grows to only ~2 m in thickness but sea ice that is more than 1 year old  can be several metres thicker. Arctic sea ice drifts within the basin, driven by wind and ocean currents: the mean drift pattern is dominated by a clockwise circulation pattern in the western Arctic and a Transpolar Drift Stream that transports Siberian sea ice across the Arctic and exports it from the basin through the Fram Strait. Satellites with the capability to distinguish ice and open water have provided a picture of the sea ice cover changes. Since 1979, the annual average extent of ice in the Arctic has decreased by 3.8% per decade. The decline in extent at the end of summer  has been even greater at 11% per decade, reaching a record minimum in 2012. The decadal average extent of the September minimum Arctic ice cover has decreased for each decade since satellite records began. Submarine and satellite records suggest that the thickness of Arctic ice, and hence the total volume, is also decreasing. Changes in the relative amounts of perennial and seasonal ice are contributing to the reduction in ice volume. Over the 34-year record, approximately 17% of this type of sea ice per decade has been lost to melt and export out of the basin since 1979 and 40% since 1999. Although the area of Arctic sea ice coverage can fluctuate from year to year because of variable seasonal production, the proportion of thick perennial ice, and the total sea ice volume, can recover only slowly.	0
Unlike the Arctic, the sea ice cover around Antarctica is constrained to latitudes north of 78S because of the presence of the continental land mass. The Antarctic sea ice cover is largely seasonal, with an average thickness of only ~1 m at the time of maximum extent in September. Only a small fraction of the ice cover survives the summer minimum in February, and very little Antarctic sea ice is more than 2 years old. The ice edge is exposed to the open ocean and the snowfall rate over Antarctic sea ice is higher than in the Arctic. When the snow load from snowfall is sufficient to depress the ice surface below sea level, seawater infiltrates the base of the snow pack and snow-ice is formed when the resultant slush freezes. Consequently, snow-to-ice conversion  contributes to the seasonal growth in ice thickness and total ice volume in the Antarctic. Snow-ice formation is sensitive to changes in precipitation and thus changes in regional climate. The consequence of changes in precipitation on Antarctic sea ice thickness and volume remains a focus for research. Unconstrained by land boundaries, the latitudinal extent of the Antarctic sea ice cover is highly variable. Near the Antarctic coast, sea ice drift is predominantly from east to west, but further north, it is from west to east and highly divergent. Distinct clockwise circulation patterns that transport ice northward can be found in the Weddell and Ross seas, while the circulation is more variable around East Antarctica. The northward extent of the sea ice cover is controlled in part by the divergent drift that is conducive in winter months to new ice formation in persistent open water areas  along the coastlines. These zones of ice formation result in saltier and thus denser ocean water and become one of the primary sources of the deepest water found in the global oceans. Over the same 34-year satellite record, the annual extent of sea ice in the Antarctic increased at about 1.5% per decade. However, there are regional differences in trends, with decreases seen in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas, but a larger increase in sea ice extent in the Ross Sea that dominates the overall trend. Whether the smaller overall increase in Antarctic sea ice extent is meaningful as an indicator of climate is uncertain because the extent 	0
varies so much from year to year and from place to place around the continent. Results from a recent study suggest that these contrasting trends in ice coverage may be due to trends in regional wind speed and patterns. Without better ice thickness and ice volume estimates, it is difficult to characterize how Antarctic sea ice cover is responding to changing climate, or which climate parameters are most influential. There are large differences in the physical environment and processes that affect the state of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice cover and contribute to their dissimilar responses to climate change. The long, and unbroken, record of satellite observations have provided a clear picture of the decline of the Arctic sea ice cover, but available evidence precludes us from making robust statements about overall changes in Antarctic sea ice and their causes.	0
waves, and strong wind events that cause the ice to break-up. Historical records of Antarctic land-fast ice extent, such as that of Kozlovsky et al.  covering 0 to 160E, were limited by sparse and sporadic sampling. Recently, using cloud-free Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer  composite images, Fraser et al.  derived a high-resolution time series of land-fast sea ice extent along the East Antarctic coast, showing a statistically significant increase  between March 2000 and December 2008. There is a strong increase in the Indian Ocean sector , and a non-significant decrease in the sector from 90E to 160E . An apparent shift from a negative to a positive trend was noted in the Indian Ocean sector from 2004, which coincided with greater interannual variability. Although significant changes are observed, this record is only 9 years in length.	0
4.2.3.7 Decadal Trends in Antarctic Sea Ice For the Antarctic, any changes in many sea ice characteristics are unknown. There has been a small but significant increase in total annual mean sea ice extent that is very likely in the range of 1.2 to 1.8 % per decade between 1979 and 2012  . There was also a greater increase in ice area associated with an increase in ice concentration. But there are strong regional differences within this total, with some regions increasing in extent/area and some decreasing . Similarly, there are contrasting regions around the Antarctic where the ice-free season has lengthened, and others where it has decreased over the satellite period . There are still inadequate data to make any assessment of changes to Antarctic sea ice thickness and volume.	0
This section considers all perennial surface land ice masses  outside of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Glaciers occur where climate conditions and topographic characteristics allow snow to accumulate over several years and to transform gradually into firn  and finally to ice. Under the force of gravity, this ice flows downwards to elevations with higher temperatures where various processes of ablation  dominate over accumulation . The sum of all accumulation and ablation processes determines the mass balance of a glacier. Accumulation is in most regions due mainly to solid precipitation , but also results from refreezing of liquid water, especially in polar regions or at high altitudes where firn remains below melting temperature. Ablation is, in most regions, mainly due to surface melting with subsequent runoff, but loss of ice by calving  or sublimation  can also dominate. Re-distribution of snow by wind and avalanches can contribute to both accumulation and ablation. The energy and mass fluxes governing the surface mass balance are directly linked to atmospheric conditions and are modified by topography . Glaciers are sensitive climate indicators because they adjust their size in response to changes in climate  . Glaciers are also important seasonal to long-term hydrologic reservoirs  on a regional scale and a major contributor to sea level rise on a global scale (see	0
The total area covered by glaciers was only roughly known in AR4, resulting in large uncertainties for all related calculations . Since AR4, the world glacier inventory  was gradually extended by Cogley  and Radi and Hock ; and for AR5, a new globally complete data set of glacier outlines ) was compiled from a wide range of data sources from the 1950s to 2010 with varying levels of detail and quality . Regional glacier-covered areas for 19 regions were extracted from the RGI and supplemented with the percentage of the area covered by glaciers terminating in tidewater . The areas covered by glaciers that are in contact with freshwater lakes are only locally available. The separation of so-called peripheral glaciers from the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica is not easy. A new detailed inventory of the glaciers in Greenland  allows for estimation of their area, volume, and mass balance separately from those of the ice sheet. This separation is still incomplete for Antarctica, and values discussed here  refer to the glaciers on the islands in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic  but exclude glaciers on the mainland of Antarctica that are separate from the ice sheet. Regionally variable accuracy of the glacier outlines leads to poorly quantified uncertainties. These uncertainties, along with the regional variation in the minimum size of glaciers included in the inventory, and the subdivision of contiguous ice masses, also makes the total number of glaciers uncertain; the current best estimate is around 170,000 covering a total area of about 730,000 km2. When summed up, nearly 80% of the glacier area found in regions Antarctic and Subantarctic , Canadian Arctic , High Mountain Asia , Alaska , and Greenland  . From the glacier areas in the new inventory, total glacier volumes and masses have been determined by applying both simple scaling relations and ice-dynamical considerations , however, both methods are calibrated with only a few hundred glacier thickness measurements. This small sample means that uncertainties are large and difficult to quantify. The range of values as derived from four global-scale studies for each of the 19 RGI regions is given in Table 4.2, suggesting a global glacier mass that is likely between 114,000 and 192,000 Gt . The numbers and areas of glaciers reported in Table 4.2 are directly taken from RGI 2.0 , with updates for the Low Latitudes  and the Southern Andes .	0
main characteristics are summarized in Table 4.3. Monitoring programs include complex climate-related observations at a few glaciers, index measurements of mass balance at about a hundred glaciers, annual length changes for a few hundred glaciers, and repeat geodetic estimates of area and volume changes at regional scales using remote sensing methods . Although in situ measurements of glacier changes are biased towards glaciers that are easily accessible, comparatively small and simple to interpret, a large proportion of all glaciers in the world is debris covered or tidewater calving  and changes of such glaciers are more difficult to interpret in climatic terms . In addition, many of the remote-sensing based assessments do not discriminate these types.	0
difficult to access, aerial photography and satellite imaging have been used to determine glacier length changes over the past decades. For selected glaciers globally, historic terminus positions have been reconstructed from maps, photographs, satellite imagery, also paintings, dated moraines and other sources . Early reconstructions are sparsely distributed in both space and time, generally at intervals of decades. The terminus fluctuations of some individual glaciers have been reconstructed for periods of more than 3000 years , with a much larger number of records available as far back as the 16th or 17th centuries . The reconstructed glacier length records are globally well distributed and were used, for example, to determine the contribution of glaciers to global sea level rise  , and for an independent temperature reconstruction at a hemispheric scale .	0
Table 4.2 | The 19 regions used throughout this chapter and their respective glacier numbers and area  are derived from the RGI 2.0 ; the tidewater fraction is from Gardner et al. . The minimum and maximum values of glacier mass are the minimum and maximum of the estimates given in four studies: Grinsted , Huss and Farinotti , Marzeion et al.  and Radi et al. . The mean sea level equivalent  of the mean glacier mass is the mean of estimates from the same four studies, using an ocean area of 362.5 x 106 km2 for conversion. All values were derived with globally consistent methods; deviations from more precise national data sets are thus possible. Ongoing improvements may lead to revisions of these  numbers in future releases of the RGI.	0
4.3.2.2 Area Change Measurements Glacier area changes are reported in increasing number and coverage based on repeat satellite imagery . Although satellite-based observations are available only for the past four decades, studies using aerial photography, old maps, as well as mapped and dated moraines and trim lines show glacier areas back to the end of the so-called Little Ice Age  about 150 years ago  and beyond . The observed area changes depend  on glacier size  and tend to vary greatly within any one mountain range. Moreover, the time spans of the measurements of change vary from study to study and regional or global-scale estimates are therefore difficult to generate. The focus here is thus on the comparison of mean annual relative area changes averaged over entire mountain regions.	0
over glacier regions and types. Annual measurements began in the 1940s on a few glaciers, with about 100 glaciers being measured since the 1980s--and only 37 glaciers have been measured without interruption for more than 40 years . Potential mass loss from calving or from basal ablation is not included in the surface measurements. At present, it is not possible to quantify all sources of uncertainty in mass budgets extrapolated from measurements of individual glaciers . A second method determines the volume change of all glaciers in a region by measurement of surface-elevation changes . The information is derived by subtracting digital terrain models from two points in time, including those from repeat airborne or satellite altimetry . The conversion from volume to mass change can cause a major uncertainty, in particular over short periods, as density information is required, but is generally available only from field measurements .	0
A fourth method calculates the mass balance of individual glaciers, or a glacier region, with models that either convert particular glacier variables such as length changes or the altitude of the equilibrium line   into mass changes, or use time series of atmospheric temperature and other meteorological variables to simulate glacier mass balances at different levels of complexity . The models improve fidelity and physical completeness, and add value to the scarce direct measurements. A fifth method determines glacier mass changes as residuals of the water balance for hydrological basins rather than for glacier regions. Results from all but this last method are used in the following regional and global assessment of glacier mass changes .	0
Despite their variability due to different response times and local conditions , the annually measured glacier terminus fluctuations from about 500 glaciers worldwide reveal a largely homogeneous trend of retreat . In Figure 4.9, a selection of the available long-term records of field measurements is shown for 14 out of the 19 RGI regions. Cumulative values of retreat for large, land-terminating valley glaciers typically reach a few kilometres over the 120year period of observation. For mid-latitude mountain and valley glaciers, typical retreat rates are of the order of 5 to 20 m yr-1. Rates of up to 100 m yr-1  are seen to occur under special conditions, such as the complete loss of a tongue on a steep slope , or the disintegration of a very flat tongue. A non-calving valley glacier in Chile had reported mean annual retreat rates of 125 m from 1961 to 2011 . The general tendency of retreat in the 20th century was interrupted in several regions  by phases of stability lasting one or two decades, or even advance, for example in the 1920s, 1970s and 1990s . In regions for which long-term field measurements of several glaciers of different sizes are available, the terminus fluctuations	0
typically show a pattern with the largest  glaciers tending to retreat continuously and by large cumulative distances, medium-sized  glaciers showing decadal fluctuations, and smaller glaciers showing high variability superimposed on smaller cumulative retreats . The exceptional terminus advances of a few individual glaciers in Scandinavia and New Zealand in the 1990s may be related to locally specific climatic conditions such as increased winter precipitation . In other regions, such as Iceland, the Karakoram and Svalbard, observed advances were often related to dynamical instabilities  of glaciers . Glaciers with calving instabilities can retreat exceptionally rapidly , while those with heavily debris-covered tongues are often close to stationary . More regionallyfocused studies of length change over different time periods  justify high confidence about the trend of glacier length variations shown in Figure 4.9.	0
4.3.3.2 Area Changes From the large number of published studies on glacier area changes in all parts of the world since AR4  a selection with examples from 16 out of the 19 RGI regions is shown in Figure 4.10. The studies reveal that  total glacier area has decreased in all regions,  the rates of change cover a similar range of values in all regions,  there is considerable variability of the rates of change within each region,  highest loss rates are found in regions 2, 11 and 16, and  the rates of loss have a tendency to be higher over more recent time periods. The last point  requires studies comparing the same sample of glaciers over multiple similar time periods. For 14 out of 19 regions listed in Table 4.SM.1  with such an analysis, higher loss rates were found for the more recent period. While points  and  give high confidence in the global-scale shrinkage in glacier area,  points to a considerable regional to local-scale scatter of observed change rates. The shorter the period of investigation and the smaller the sample of glaciers analysed, the more variable	0
are the rates of change reported for a specific region . In many regions of the world, rates of area loss have increased , confirming that glaciers are still too large for the current climate and will continue to shrink . Several studies have reported the disappearance of glaciers, among others in Arctic Canada , the Rocky Mountains  and North Cascades , Patagonia , several tropical mountain ranges , the European Alps , the Tien Shan  in Asia and on James Ross Island in Antarctica . In total, the disappearance of more than 600 glaciers has been reported, but the real number is certainly higher. Also some of the glaciers, whose annual mass balance has been measured over several years or even decades, have disappeared or started to disintegrate . Though the number of glaciers that have disappeared is difficult to compare directly , glaciers that have disappeared provide robust evidence that the ELA  has risen above the highest peaks in many mountain ranges .	0
4.3.3.3 Regional Scale Glacier Volume and Mass Changes In AR4, global and regional scale glacier mass changes were extrapolated from in situ measurements of mass balance on individual glaciers . In some regions, such as Alaska, Patagonia and the Russian Arctic, very few if any such records were available. Since AR4, geodetically derived ice volume changes have been assimilated , providing more consistent regional coverage and better representation of the proportion of calving glaciers. In addition, the new near complete inventory  of glacier-covered areas  has improved knowledge about regional and global glacier volume and mass changes. Figure 4.11 shows a compilation of available mean mass-balance rates for 1960-2010 for each of the 19 RGI regions. Where error estimates are reported, the 90% confidence bounds are shown. Most results shown are calculated using a single method, some merge multiple methods; those from Gardner et al.  are reconciled estimates for 2003-2009 obtained by selecting the most reliable results of different observation methods, after region-by-region reanalysis and comparison. Despite the great progress made since AR4, uncertainties inherent to specific methods, and arising from the differences between methods (cf.	0

cover such as Western Canada/USA  and the Qinghai-Xizang  Plateau . Based on ICESat measurements, Gardner et al.  also found that glaciers with in situ measurements tend to be located in sub-regions that are thinning more rapidly than the region as a whole. Thus, extrapolation from in situ measurements has a negative bias in regions with sparse measurements. Based on this analysis, Gardner et al.  excluded GRACE results for regions with small or scattered glacier coverage and excluded results based on extrapolation of local records for remote, sparsely sampled regions. The 2003-2009 regionally differentiated results are given in Table 4.4. There is very high confidence that, between 2003 and 2009, most mass loss was from glaciers in the Canadian Arctic , Alaska , Greenland , the Southern Andes  and the Asian Mountains , which together account for more than 80% of the global ice loss. Despite the considerable scatter, Figure 4.11 shows mass losses in all 19 regions over the past five decades that, together with their consistency with length  and area changes , provide robust evidence and very high confidence in global glacier shrinkage. In many regions, ice loss has likely increased during the last two decades, with slightly smaller losses in some regions during the most recent years, since around 2005. In Central Europe , the increase of loss rates was earliest and strongest. In the Russian Arctic  and in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic , the signal is highly uncertain and trends are least clear. Gardner et al.  present values close to balance for the Antarctic and Subantarctic  that result from complex regional patterns, for exam-	0
ple, with losses on Antarctic Peninsula islands and gains on Ellsworth Land islands. The picture is also heterogeneous in High M  ountain Asia  , where glaciers in the Himalaya and the Hindu Kush have been losing mass  while those in the Karakoram are close to balance . Several studies of recent glacier velocity change  and of the worldwide present-day sizes of accumulation areas  indicate that the world's glaciers are out of balance with the present climate and thus committed to losing considerable mass in the future, even without further changes in climate. Increasing ice temperatures recorded at high elevation sites in the tropical Andes  and in the European Alps  , as well as the ongoing thinning of the cold surface layer on Storglaciaren in northern Sweden , support this conclusion and give it high confidence.	0
4.3.3.4 Global Scale Glacier Mass Changes--The Contribution to Sea Level Global time series are required to assess the continuing contribution of glacier mass changes to sea level . A series of recent studies, some updated to RGI areas for this report by their respective authors, provides very high confidence in a considerable and continuous mass loss, despite only medium agreement on the specific rates . Cogley  compiled 4,817 directly measured annual mass budgets, and 983 volume change measurements by extending the data set of WGMS . Global 5-year averages for 1961-2010, with uncertainties, were estimated from these using an inverse-distance-weighted interpolation. Newly available volume change measurements increased the proportion of observations from calving glaciers from 3% to 16% compared to earlier estimates reported by Lemke et al. . This proportion is more realistic, but may still underestimate the relative importance of calving glaciers . Leclercq et al.  used length variations from 382 glaciers worldwide as a proxy for glacier mass loss since 1800. The length/mass change conversion was calibrated against mass balance observations for 1950-2005 from Cogley  and provide one estimate based on the arithmetic mean and another based on area-weighted extrapolation of regional averages. Uncertainty was estimated from upper and lower bounds of the calibration parameter assumptions, and cumulatively propagated backward in time. For the 19th century, the information was constrained by a limited number of observations, particularly in extensively glacierized regions that contribute most to the global mass budget. Two global-scale time series are obtained from mass-balance modelling based on temperature and precipitation data . Glacier size adjustments are simulated by using area-volume power-law relations as proposed by Bahr et al.  for the approximately 170,000 individual glaciers delineated in	0
Figure 4.12 | Global cumulative  and annual  glacier mass change for  1801-2010 and  1961-2010. The cumulative estimates are all set to zero mean over 1986-2005. Estimates are based on glacier length variations , from area-weighted extrapolations of individual directly and geodetically measured glacier mass budgets , and from modelling with atmospheric variables as input . Uncertainties are based on comprehensive error analyses in Cogley  and Marzeion et al.  and on assumptions about the representativeness of the sampled glaciers in Leclercq et al. . Hirabayashi et al.  give a bulk error estimate only. For clarity in the bottom panels, uncertainties are shown only for the Cogley and Marzeion curves excluding Greenland .

the RGI. Marzeion et al.  derive mass balances for 1902-2009 from monthly mean temperature and precipitation obtained from Mitchell and Jones . The model is calibrated against measured time series and validated against independent measurements. Uncertainty estimates are obtained from comprehensive error propagation, first accumulated temporally for each glacier, and then regionally and globally. The model does not account for the subsurface mass balance or calving, but reproduces geodetically measured volume changes for land-based glaciers within the uncertainties; however, it underestimates volume loss slightly for calving glaciers. Hirabayashi et al.  force an extended positive degree-day model with data from an observation-based global set of daily precipitation and near-surface temperature as updated from earlier work . Annual mass balance is provided for 1948-2005 with a constant root mean square error of 500 km3 yr-1, estimated from comparison of modelled with measured mass balances. For the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic  observational information is limited and difficult to incorporate into this assessment. For some studies the time spans do not match . Some estimates	0
have been made simply by extrapolating the global mean to region 19 . One  mean glacier mass loss estimate based on an ECMWF 40-year reanalysis  driven simulation , is for a glacier area differing from the RGI region 19. For these reasons, the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic  is excluded from this global glacier mass change assessment. The contribution of region 19 to sea level is assumed to be within the uncertainty bounds of the Antarctic ice sheet assessment . Whereas Hirabayashi et al.  exclude the Antarctic and Greenland from their simulations and Leclercq et al.  implicitly include Greenland, both Cogley  and Marzeion et al.  explicitly estimate mass changes in Greenland. In Figure 4.12, cumulative mass changes and corresponding rates are shown for global glaciers excluding regions 5 and 19 , and also for global glaciers excluding only region 19 . The cumulative curves are normalized such that their 1986-2005 averages are all zero. The arithmetic-mean estimate of Leclercq et al.  indicates continuous mass loss from glaciers after about 1850 . During the 1920s their area-weighted extrapolation reaches consid343	0
erably higher rates  than the other estimates, but the reasons remain unclear. After 1950, mass loss rates including Greenland are all within the uncertainty bounds of those that exclude Greenland, except for the 2001-2005 period when the Greenland contribution was slightly outside the uncertainty bounds for both the Cogley and the Marzeion et al. estimates. Most notable is the rapid loss from Greenland glaciers in the Marzeion et al. simulations during the 1930s. Other studies support rapid Greenland mass loss around this time ; however, the neighbouring regions in the Canadian Arctic  and Iceland have mass loss anomalies an order of magnitude lower than predicted for Greenland in the same simulation. This discrepancy may be an artefact of the uncertainties in the forcing and methods of Marzeion et al. that are considerably larger in the first than in the second half of the 20th century, so that the rates may well be overestimated. The Marzeion et al. rates are also considerably greater in the 1950s and 1960s than in the other studies; during this period, the most rapid losses are in Arctic Canada and the Russian Arctic .	0
Overall, there is very high confidence that globally, the mass loss from glaciers has increased since the 1960s, and this is evident in regional-scale estimates . For 2003-2009, Gardner et al.  indicate that some regional  and also the global time series may overestimate mass loss . That glaciers with measured mass balances are concentrated in sub-regions with higher mass losses definitely biases the estimates of Cogley  , but this explanation cannot hold for the Marzeion et al.  time series, for which mass changes are simulated separately for every single glacier in the inventory. It also remains unclear whether the 2003-2009 inconsistency identified by Gardner et al.  applies to earlier times, and if so how it should be reconciled. Neither the evidence nor our level of understanding warrants any simple correction of the longer time series at present. Table 4.5 summarizes global-scale glacier mass losses for different periods relevant to discussions on sea level change  and the global energy budget . Values are given separately for the Greenland glaciers alone  and for all glaciers e xcluding	0
those in regions 5 and 19, which are included in the assessment of ice sheets . For the more recent periods, the time series of Cogley  and Marzeion et al.  are combined, while for 1901-1990 the Leclercq et al.  series were separated by area-weighting and combined with the Marzeion et al.  values. Each rate in Table 4.5 is thus the arithmetic mean of two series, with a confidence bound calculated from their difference, and assessed to represent the 90% likelihood range. Because differences between the two time series vary considerably, the average confidence bound of 1971-2009 is also applied uniformly to the two sub-periods 1993- 2009 and 2005-2009. The 2003-2009 estimate of Gardner et al.  is lower than the Cogley and Marzeion averages but those for all glaciers excluding regions 5 and 19 are within the 2005-2009 90% confidence bound. The 1991-2009 assessment is shown as a cumulative time series in Section 4.8 . Earlier studies of the long-term contribution of glaciers to sea level change  all give smaller estimates than those assessed here.	0
FAQ 4.2 | Are Glaciers in Mountain Regions Disappearing? In many mountain ranges around the world, glaciers are disappearing in response to the atmospheric temperature increases of past decades. Disappearing glaciers have been reported in the Canadian Arctic and Rocky Mountains; the Andes; Patagonia; the European Alps; the Tien Shan; tropical mountains in South America, Africa and Asia and elsewhere. In these regions, more than 600 glaciers have disappeared over the past decades. Even if there is no further warming, many more glaciers will disappear. It is also likely that some mountain ranges will lose most, if not all, of their glaciers. In all mountain regions where glaciers exist today, glacier volume has decreased considerably over the past 150 years. Over that time, many small glaciers have disappeared. With some local exceptions, glacier shrinkage  was globally widespread already and particularly strong during the 1940s and since the 1980s. However, there were also phases of relative stability during the 1890s, 1920s and 1970s, as indicated by longterm measurements of length changes and by modelling of mass balance. Conventional in situ measurements--and increasingly, airborne and satellite measurements--offer robust evidence in most glacierized regions that the rate of reduction in glacier area was higher over the past two decades than previously, and that glaciers continue to shrink. In a few regions, however, individual glaciers are behaving differently and have advanced while most others were in retreat , or in the Karakoram range in Asia). In general, these advances are the result of special topographic and/or climate conditions . It can take several decades for a glacier to adjust its extent to an instantaneous change in climate, so most glaciers are currently larger than they would be if they were in balance with current climate. Because the time required for the adjustment increases with glacier size, larger glaciers will continue to shrink over the next few decades, even if temperatures stabilise. Smaller glaciers will also continue to shrink, but they will adjust their extent faster and many will ultimately disappear entirely. Many factors influence the future development of each glacier, and whether it will disappear: for instance, its size, slope, elevation range, distribution of area with elevation, and its surface characteristics . These factors vary substantially from region to region, and also between neighbouring glaciers. External factors, such as the surrounding topography and the climatic regime, are also important for future glacier evolution. Over shorter time scales , each glacier responds to climate change individually and differently in detail.	0
Over periods longer than about 50 years, the response is more coherent and less dependent on local environmental details, which means that long-term trends in glacier development can be well modelled. Such models are built on an understanding of basic physical principles. For example, an increase in local mean air temperature, with no change in precipitation, will cause an upward shift of the equilibrium line altitude  by about 150 m for each degree Celsius of atmospheric warming. Such an upward shift and its consequences for glaciers of different size and elevation range are illustrated in FAQ 4.2, Figure 1. Initially, all glaciers have an accumulation area  above and an ablation area  below the ELA . As the ELA shifts upwards, the accumulation area shrinks and the ablation area expands, thus increasing the area over which ice is lost through melt . This imbalance results in an overall loss of ice. After several years, the glacier front retreats, and the ablation area shrinks until the glacier has adjusted its extent to the new climate . Where climate change is sufficiently strong to raise the ELA permanently above the glacier's highest point  the glacier will eventually disappear entirely . Higher glaciers, which retain their accumulation areas, will shrink but not disappear . A large valley glacier might lose much of its tongue, probably leaving a lake in its place . Besides air temperature, changes in the quantity and seasonality of precipitation influence the shift of the ELA as well. Glacier dynamics  also plays a role, but is not considered in this simplified scheme. Many observations have confirmed that different glacier types do respond differently to recent climate change. For example, the flat, low-lying tongues of large valley glaciers  currently show the strongest mass losses, largely independent of aspect, shading or debris cover. This type of glacier is slow in 	0
adjusting its extent to new climatic conditions and reacts mainly by thinning without substantial terminus retreat. In contrast, smaller mountain glaciers, with fairly constant slopes, adjust more quickly to the new climate by changing the size of their ablation area more rapidly . The long-term response of most glacier types can be determined very well with the approach illustrated in FAQ 4.2, Figure 1. However, modelling short-term glacier response, or the longterm response of more complex glacier types , is difficult. These cases require detailed knowledge of other glacier characteristics, such as mass balance, ice thickness distribution, and internal hydraulics. For the majority of glaciers worldwide, such data are unavailable, and their response to climate change can thus only be approximated with the simplified scheme shown in FAQ 4.2, Figure 1. The Karakoram-Himalaya mountain range, for instance, has a large variety of glacier types and climatic conditions, and glacier characteristics are still only poorly known. This makes determining their future evolution particularly uncertain. However, gaps in knowledge are expected to decrease substantially in coming years, thanks to increased use of satellite data  and extension of the groundbased measurement network.	0
FAQ 4.2, Figure 1 | Schematic of three types of glaciers located at different elevations, and their response to an upward shift of the equilibrium line altitude .  For a given climate, the ELA has a specific altitude , and all glaciers have a specific size.  Due to a temperature increase, the ELA shifts upwards to a new altitude , initially resulting in reduced accumulation and larger ablation areas for all glaciers.  After glacier size has adjusted to the new ELA, the valley glacier  has lost its tongue and the small glacier  has disappeared entirely.	0

in situ measurements . In Antarctica, surface mass balance  for 1979-2010 is estimated at 1983  122 Gt yr-1  with interannual variability of 114 Gt yr-1 driven by snowfall variability . Comparison with 750 in situ observations indicates an overall uncertainty of 6% for total ice sheet mass balance, ranging from 5 to 20% for individual drainage basins . In Greenland, total snowfall  and rainfall  minus runoff  and evaporation/sublimation  yield a surface mass balance of 469  82 Gt yr-1 for 1958-2007 . The 17% uncertainty is based on a comparison of model outputs with 350 in situ accumulation observations and, in the absence of runoff data, an imposed 20% uncertainty in runoff . Interannual variability in surface mass balance is large  due to the out-of-phase relationship between the variability in precipitation  and runoff . 	0
snow density and bed elevation; or if the ice is floating, for tides and sea level) reveals changes in ice sheet mass. Satellite radar altimetry  has been widely used , as has laser altimetry from airplanes  and satellites . Both radar and laser methods have significant challenges. The field-of-view of early SRALT sensors was ~20 km in diameter, and as a consequence, interpretation of the data they acquired over ice sheets with undulating surfaces or significant slopes was complex. Also, for radar altimeters, estimates are affected by penetration of the radar signal below the surface, which depends on characteristics such as snow density and wetness, and by wide orbit separation . Errors in surface-elevation change are typically determined from the internal consistency of the m  easurements, often after iterative removal of surface elevation-change values that exceed some multiple of the local value of their standard deviation; this results in very small error estimates . Laser altimeters have been used from aircraft for many years, but satellite laser altimetry, available for the first time from NASA's ICESat satellite launched in 2003, has provided many new results since AR4. Laser	0
altimetry is easier to validate and interpret than radar data; the field of view is small , and there is negligible penetration below the surface. However, clouds limit data acquisition, and accuracy is affected by atmospheric conditions, laser-pointing errors, and data scarcity. Knowledge of the density of the snow and firn in the upper layers of an ice sheet is required to convert altimetric measurements to mass change. However, snow densification rates are sensitive to snow temperature and wetness. Warm conditions favour more rapid densification . Consequently, recent Greenland warming has probably caused surface lowering simply from this effect. Corrections are inferred from models that are difficult to validate and are typically less than 2 cm yr-1. ICESat derived surface elevation changes supplemented with differenced ASTER  satellite digital elevation models were used for outlet glaciers in southeast Greenland  and for the northern Antarctic Peninsula . Laser surveys from airborne platforms over Greenland yield elevation estimates accurate to 10 cm along reference targets  and 15 cm for ICESat using ground-based high-resolution GPS measurements . For a 5-year separation between surveys, this is an uncertainty of 2.0 cm yr-1 for airborne platforms and 3 cm yr-1 for ICESat. Early in 2013, NASA released an elevation correction for ICESat  that is relevant to several studies cited in this chapter, but was provided too late to be included in those studies. This correction improves shot-to-shot variability in ICESat elevations, although spatial averaging and application of inter-campaign bias corrections derived from calibration data and used in many studies already mitigates the impact of the higher variability. The correction also changes elevation trend estimates over the 2003- 2009 ICESat mission period by up to -1.4 cm yr-1. To date, a thorough treatment of the impact of this finding has not been published in the peer-reviewed literature, but the overall magnitude of the effect is reported to be at the level of 1.4 cm yr-1. For many studies of glaciers, ice sheets and sea ice this is substantially lower  than the signal of change, but elsewhere  it may have an impact. However, multiple lines of evidence, of which ICESat is only one, are used to arrive at the conclusions presented in this chapter. To the degree to which it can be assessed, there is high confidence that the substantive conclusions this chapter will not be affected by revisions of the ICESat data products. 4.4.2.1.3	0
10 years, estimates of ice sheet mass change from GRACE have lower uncertainties than in AR4 . The ice-loss signal from the last decade is also more distinct because the numbers have grown significantly higher . The estimates of ice loss based on data from GRACE vary between published studies due to the time-variable nature of the signal, along with other factors that include  data-centre specific processing,  specific methods used to calculate the mass change, and  contamination by other signals within the ice sheet  or outside the ice sheet . Many of these differences have been reduced in studies published since AR4, resulting in greater agreement between GRACE estimates . In Antarctica, the GIA signal is similar in magnitude to the ice-loss signal, with an uncertainty of 80 Gt yr-1 . Correction for the GIA signal is addressed using numerical models . A comparison of recent GIA models  with improved constraints on ice-loading history, indicate better agreement with direct observations of vertical land movements , despite a potential discrepancy between far-field sea level records and common NH deglaciation models. In Greenland, the GIA correction is less than 10% of the GRACE signal with an error of 19 Gt yr-1. However, because the GIA rate is constant over the satellite's lifetime, GIA uncertainty does not affect the estimate of any change in the rate of ice mass loss . In Antarctica, the adoption of new GIA models has resulted in a lowering of estimated ice-sheet mass loss . In addition to GRACE, the elastic response of the crustal deformation shown in GPS measurements of uplift rates confirms increasing rates of ice loss in Greenland  and Antarctica . Analysis of a 34-year time series of the Earth's oblateness  by satellite laser ranging also suggests that ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica has progressively dominated the change in oblateness trend since the 1990s .	0

These studies do not include earlier estimates from the same researchers when those have been updated by more recent analyses using extended data. They include estimates made from satellite gravimetry, satellite altimetry and the mass budget method. Details of the studies used for Greenland are listed in Appendix Table 4.A.1 . The mass balance for each year is estimated as a simple average of all the selected estimates available for that particular year. Figure 4.15 shows an accumulation of these estimates since an arbitrary zero on 1 January 1992. The number of estimates available varies with time, with as few as two estimates per year in the 1990s and up to 18 per year from 2004. The cumulative uncertainty in Figure 4.15 is based on the uncertainty cited in the original studies which, when the confidence level is not specifically given, is assumed to be at the 1 standard deviation  level. However, the annual estimates from different studies often do not overlap within the original uncertainties, and hence the error limits used in this assessment are derived from the absolute maximum and minimum mass balance estimate for each year. These have been converted to the 90% confidence interval . The cumulative error is weighted by 1/n , where n is the number of years accumulated.	0
individual studies  . The average ice mass change to Greenland from the present assessment has been -121  Gt yr-1  mm yr-1) over the period 1993 to 2010, and -229  Gt yr-1  mm yr-1 sea level equivalent) over the period 2005-2010. Greenland changes that include and exclude peripheral glaciers cannot be cleanly separated from the mixture of studies and techniques in this assessment, but for the post 2003 period there is a prevalence of gravity studies, which do include the peripheral glaciers. Hence, although the estimated mass change in Greenland peripheral glaciers of -38  7 Gt yr-1over the period 2003-2009  is discussed in Section 4.3.3 , these changes are included within the values for ice-sheet change quoted in this section, and not as part of the total mass change for glaciers. A reconciliation of apparent disparities between the different satellite methods was made by the Ice-sheet Mass Balance Intercomparison Experiment  . This intercomparison combined an ensemble of satellite altimetry, interferometry, airborne radio-echo sounding and airborne gravimetry data and regional	0
across the ensemble for each method, of -142  49 Gt yr-1 . For the same period, this present assessment, which averages across individual studies, yields a slightly slower loss, with a rate of mass change of -125  25 Gt yr-1 at the 90% confidence level . Averaging across technique ensembles in the present assessment yields a loss at a rate of -129 Gt yr-1 . Shepherd et al.  confirm an increasing mass loss from Greenland, although they also identify mass balance variations over intermediate  periods. The mass budget method shows that ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet is partitioned in approximately similar amounts between surface mass balance  and discharge from ice flow across the grounding line  . However, there are significant differences in the relative importance of ice discharge and surface mass balance in various regions of Greenland . Dynamic losses dominate in southeast and central west regions, and also influence losses in northwest Greenland, whereas in the central north, southwest and northeast sectors, changes in surface mass balance appear to dominate. There is high confidence that over the last two decades, surface mass balance has become progressively more negative as a result of an increase in surface melt and runoff, and that ice discharge across the grounding line has also been enhanced due to the increased speed of some outlet glaciers. Altimetric measurements of surface height suggest slight inland thickening in 1994-2006 , but this is not confirmed by regional atmospheric climate model outputs for the period 1957-2009 , nor recent ice core  data , hence there is low confidence in an increase in precipitation in Greenland in recent decades. Probable changes in accumulation are, however, exceeded by the increased runoff especially since 2006 . The four highest runoff years over the last 140 years occurred since 1995 . The total surface melt area has continued to increase since AR4 and has accelerated in the past few years , with an extreme melt event covering more than 90% of the ice sheet for a few days in July 2012 . Annual surface mass balance in 2011-2012 was 2 standard deviations  below the 2003-2012 mean. Such extreme melt events are rare and have been observed in ice core records only twice, once in 1889, and once more, seven centuries earlier in the Medieval Warm Period . Over the past decade, the surface albedo of the Greenland ice sheet has decreased by up to 18% in coastal regions, with a statistically significant increase over 87% of the ice sheet due to melting and snow metamorphism, allowing more solar energy to be absorbed for surface melting . GRACE results show ice loss was largest in southeast Greenland during 2005 and increased in the northwest after 2007 . Subsequent to 2005, ice loss decreased in the southeast. These GRACE results agree with measurements of ice discharge from the	0
major outlet glaciers that confirm the dominance of dynamic losses in these regions . In particular, major outlet glacier speed-up reported in AR4 occurred in west Greenland between 1996 and 2000  and in southeast Greenland from 2001 to 2006 . In the southeast, many outlet glaciers slowed after 2005 , with many flow speeds decreasing back towards those of the early 2000s , although most are still flowing faster and discharging more ice into the ocean than they did in 1996 . In the northwest, the increase in the rate of ice loss from 1996-2006 to 2006-2010 was probably caused partially by a higher accumulation in the late 1990s compared to earlier and later years , but ice dynamic changes also played a role as outlet glaciers in the northwest showed an increase in speed from 2000 to 2010, with the greatest increase from 2007 to 2010 . Longer-term observations of surface topography in the northwest sector confirm the dynamic component of this mass loss and suggest two periods of loss in 1985-1993 and 2005-2010 separated by limited mass changes . In the southeast, an 80-year long record reveals that many land-terminating glaciers retreated more rapidly in the 1930s compared to the 2000s, but marine-terminating glaciers retreated more rapidly during the recent warming .	0
4.4.2.3 Antarctica Antarctic results from the gravity method are also now more numerous and consistent than in AR4 . Methods combining GPS and GRACE at the regional level indicate with high confidence that the Antarctic Peninsula is losing ice . In other areas, large uncertainties remain in the global GRACEGPS solutions . The SMB reconstructions used in the mass budget method have improved considerably since AR4 . Reconstructed snowfall from regional atmospheric climate models indicates higher accumulation along the coastal sectors than in previous estimates, but little difference in total snowfall. There is medium confidence that there has been no long-term trend in the total accumulation over the continent over the past few decades . Although anomalies in accumulation have been noted in recent decades in Eastern Wilkes Land  and Law Dome  in East Antarctica, their overall impact on total mass balance is not significant. Satellite laser altimetry indicates that ice volume changes are concentrated on outlet glaciers and ice streams , as illustrated by the strong correspondence between areas of thinning  and areas of fast flow  . Figure 4.16 shows the cumulative ice mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet over the period 1992-2012 derived from recent studies made by 10 different research groups (Cazenave et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009; E et al., 2009; Horwath and Dietrich, 2009; Velicogna, 2009; Wu 351	0
et al., 2010; Rignot et al., 2011c; Shi et al., 2011; King et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2012). These studies do not include earlier estimates from the same researchers when those have been updated by more recent analyses using extended data. They include estimates made from satellite gravimetry, satellite altimetry and the mass balance method. Details of the studies used for Antarctica are listed in Table 4.A.3 . The number of estimates available varies with time, with only one estimate per year in the 1990s and up to 10 per year from 2003. The cumulative curves and associated errors are derived in the same way as those for Figure 4.15 . Overall, there is high confidence that the Antarctic ice sheet is currently losing mass. The average ice mass change to Antarctica from the present assessment has been -97  Gt yr-1  mm yr-1) over the period 1993-2010, and -147  Gt yr-1  mm yr-1) over the period 2005-2010. These assessments include the Antarctic peripheral glaciers. The recent IMBIE intercomparison  for Antarctica, where the GIA signal is less well known than in Greenland, used two new GIA models , for details see Shepherd et al. ; and Whitehouse et al. ). These new models had the effect of reducing the estimates of East Antarctic ice mass loss from GRACE data, compared with some previous estimates. For Antarctica, Shepherd et al.  estimate an average change in mass for 1992-2011 of -71  53 Gt yr-1 . For the same period this present assessment estimates a loss of 88  35 Gt yr-1 at the 90% confidence level . Averaging across technique ensembles in 352	0
the present assessment, rather than individual estimates, yields no significant difference. There is low confidence that the rate of Antarctic ice loss has increased over the last two decades ; however, GRACE data gives medium confidence of increasing loss over the last decade  . For GRACE, this conclusion is independent of the GIA signal, which is constant over the measurement period. The mass budget method suggests that the increase in loss from the mass budget method is caused by an increase in glacier flow-speed in the eastern part of the Pacific sector of West Antarctica  and the Antarctic Peninsula . Comparison of GRACE and the mass budget method for 1992-2010 indicates an increase in the rate of ice loss of, on average, 14  2 Gt yr-1 per year compared with 21  2 Gt yr-1 per year on average for Greenland during the same time period . The recent IMBIE analysis  shows that the West Antarctic ice sheet and the Antarctic Peninsula are losing mass at an increasing rate, but that East Antarctica gained an average of 21  43 Gt yr-1 between 1992 and 2011. Zwally and Giovinetto  also estimate a mass gain for East Antarctica . Their reassessment of total Antarctic change made a correction for the ice discharge estimates from regions of the ice sheet not observed in the mass budget method . The analysis of Shepherd et al.  indicated that the missing regions contribute little to the total mass change. In the near-absence of surface runoff and, as discussed in this section, with no evidence of multi-decadal change in total snowfall, there is	0
high confidence that Antarctic multi-decadal changes in grounded ice mass must be due to increased ice discharge, although the observational record of ice dynamics extends only from the 1970s and is spatially incomplete for much of this period. Over shorter time scales, however, the interannual to decadal variability in snowfall has an important impact on ice sheet mass balance . The three techniques are in excellent agreement as to the spatial pattern of ice loss  and gain  over Antarctica . There is very high confidence that the largest ice losses are located along the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula where the collapse of several ice shelves in the last two decades triggered the acceleration of outlet glaciers, and in the Amundsen Sea, in West Antarctica .. On the Antarctic Peninsula, there is evidence that precipitation has increased  but the resulting ice-gain is insufficient to counteract the losses . There is medium confidence that changes in the Amundsen Sea region are due to the thinning of ice shelves , and medium confidence that this is due to high ocean heat flux , which caused grounding line retreat   and glacier thinning . Indications of dynamic change are also evident in East Antarctica, primarily around Totten Glacier, from GRACE , altimetry , and satellite radar interferometry . The contribution to the total ice loss from these areas is, however, small and not well understood.	0
4.4.2.4 Ice Shelves and Floating Ice Tongues As much as 74% of the ice discharged from the grounded ice sheet in Antarctica passes through ice shelves and floating ice tongues . Ice shelves help to buttress and restrain flow of the grounded ice , and so changes in thickness , and extent  of ice shelves influence current ice sheet change. Indeed, nearly all of the outlet glaciers and ice streams that are experiencing high rates of ice loss flow into thinning or disintegrated ice shelves . Many of the larger ice shelves however, exhibit stable conditions . Around the Antarctic Peninsula, the reduction in ice-shelf extent has been ongoing for several decades , and has continued since AR4 with substantial collapse of a section of Wilkins Ice Shelf , which had been retreating since the late1990s . Overall, 7 of 12 ice shelves around the Peninsula have retreated in recent decades with a total loss of 28,000 km2, and a continuing rate of loss of around 6000 km2 per decade . There is high confidence that this retreat of ice shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula has been related to changing atmospheric temperatures . There is low confidence that changes in the ocean have also contributed .	0
The total ice loss from both ice sheets for the 20 years 1992-2011  has been 4260  Gt, equivalent to 11.7  mm of sea level. However, the rate of change has increased with time and most of this ice has been lost in the second decade of the 20-year period. From the data presented in Figure 4.17, the average loss in Greenland has very likely increased from 34  Gt yr-1 over the decade 1992-2001  mm yr-1), to 215  Gt yr-1 over the decade 2002-2011  mm yr-1). In Antarctica, the loss has likely increased 30  Gt yr-1  mm yr-1) for 1992-2001, to 147  Gt yr-1 for 2002-2011  mm yr-1). Over the last five years , the loss from both ice sheets combined has been equivalent to 1.2  0.4 mm yr-1 of sea level .	0
Ice sheets experience large interannual variability in snowfall, and local trends may deviate significantly from the long-term trend in integrated snowfall. However, as in AR4, the available data do not suggest any significant long-term change in accumulation in Antarctica, except for the Antarctic Peninsula . Increasing air temperature will  increase the amount of surface melt, and can also increase the moisture bearing capacity of the air, and hence can increase snowfall. Over Greenland, temperature has risen significantly since the early 1990s, reaching values similar to those in the 1930s . The Table 4.6 | Average rates of ice sheet loss given as mm of sea level equivalent, derived as described for Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16 using estimates listed in Appendix Tables 4.A.1 and 4.A.3.	0
year 2010 was an exceptionally warm year in west Greenland with Nuuk having the warmest year since the start of the temperature record in 1873 . In West Antarctica, the warming since the 1950s , the magnitude and seasonality of which are still debated, has not manifested itself in enhanced surface melting  nor in increased snowfall . Statistically significant summer warming has been observed on the east coast of the northern Antarctic Peninsula , with extension of summer melt duration , while East Antarctica has showed summer cooling . In contrast, the significant winter warming at Faraday/Vernadsky station on the western Antarctic Peninsula is attributable to a reduction of sea ice extent . 4.4.4.1.2	0
Ocean circulation delivers warm waters to ice sheets. Variations in wind patterns associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation , and tropical circulations influencing West Antarctica , are probable drivers of increasing melt at some ice-sheet margins. In some parts of Antarctica, changes in the Southern Annular Mode  may also be important. Observations have established that warm waters of subtropical origin are present within several fjords in Greenland . Satellite records and in situ observations indicate warming of the Southern Ocean  since the 1950s . This warming is confirmed by data from robotic ocean buoys   but the observational record remains short and, close to Antarctica, there are only limited observations from ships , short-duration moorings and data from instrumented seals .	0
bed, thus increasing basal water pressure, reducing basal friction and increasing ice flow speed . Such drainage events are common in southwest and northeast Greenland, but rare in the most rapidly changing southeast and northwest regions . The effect can be seen in diurnal flow variations of some land-terminating regions , and after lake-drainage events, when 50 to 110% short-term speed-up of flow has been observed. However, the effect is temporally and spatially restricted . The summer increase in speed over the annual mean is only ~10-20%, the increase is less at higher elevations , and observations suggest most lake drainages do not affect ice sheet velocity . Theory and field studies suggest an initial increase in flow rate with increased surface meltwater supply , but if the supply of surface water continues to increase and subglacial drainage becomes more efficient, basal water pressure, and thus basal motion, is reduced . Overall, there is high confidence that basal lubrication is important in modulating flow in some regions, especially southwest Greenland, but there is also high confidence that it does not explain recent dramatic regional speed-ups that have resulted in rapid increases in ice loss from calving glaciers. 4.4.4.2.2	0
Calving of icebergs from marine-terminating glaciers and ice shelves is important in their overall mass balance, but the processes that initiate calving range from seasonal melt-driven processes  to ocean swells and tsunamis , or the culmination of a response to gradual change . Some of these processes show strong climate influence, while others do not. Despite arguments of rather limited progress in this area , there have been some recent advances , and continental-scale ice sheet models currently rely on improved parameterisations . Recently more realistic models have been developed allowing the dependence of calving and climate to be explicitly investigated .	0
The projections of sea level rise presented in AR4 explicitly excluded future rapid dynamical changes  in ice flow, and stated that `understanding of these processes is limited and there is no consensus on their magnitude'. Considerable efforts have been made since AR4 to fill this knowledge gap. Chapter 13 discusses observed and likely future sea level, including model projections of changes in the volume stored in the ice sheets: in this section we summarise the processes thought to be potential causes of rapid changes in ice flow and emphasise new observational evidence that these processes are already underway. `Rapid ice sheet changes' are defined as changes that are of sufficient speed and magnitude to impact on the mass budget and hence rate of sea level rise on time scales of several decades or shorter. A further consideration is whether and under what circumstances any such changes are `irreversible', that is, would take several decades to centuries to reverse under a different climate forcing. For example, an effectively irreversible change might be the loss of a significant fraction of the Greenland ice sheet, because at its new lower  surface elevation, the ice sheet would be able to grow thicker only slowly even in a cooler climate  .	0
Observations suggest that some observed changes in ice shelves and glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula are irreversible. These ice bodies continue to experience rapid and irreversible retreat, coincident with air temperatures rising at four to six times the global average rate at some stations , and with warm Circumpolar Deep Water becoming widespread on the western continental shelf . Collapse of floating ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula, such as the 2002 collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf which is unprecedented in the last 10,000 years, has resulted in speed up of tributary glaciers by 300 to 800% . Even if iceberg calving was to cease entirely, regrowth of the Larsen B ice shelf to its pre-collapse state would take centuries based on the ice-shelf speed and size prior to its collapse . Surface melt that becomes runoff is a major contributor to mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet, which results in a lower  ice sheet surface and a lower surface albedo (allowing the surface to	0
absorb more solar radiation); both processes further increase melt. The warm summers of the last two decades , and especially in 2012 , are unusual in the multi-centennial record. Exceptionally high melt events have affected even the far north of Greenland, for example, with the partial collapse of the floating ice tongues of Ostenfeld Gletscher and Zachariae Isstrom in 2000-2006 . The importance that subsurface warm waters play in melting the periphery of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, and the evolution of these ice sheets, has become much clearer since AR4 . New observations in Greenland and Antarctica, as well as advances in theoretical understanding, show that regions of ice sheets that are grounded well below sea level are most likely to experience rapid ice mass loss, especially if the supply of heat to the ice margin increases   Where this ice meets the	0
ocean and does not form an ice shelf, warm waters can increase melting at the ice front, causing undercutting, higher calving rates, ice-front retreat  and consequent speed-up and thinning. Surface runoff also increases subglacial water discharge at the grounding line, which enhances ice melting at the ice front . Where an ice shelf is present, ice melt by the ocean may cause thinning of the shelf as well as migration of the grounding line further inland into deep basins, with a major impact on buttressing, flow speed and thinning rate . The influence of the ocean on the ice sheets is controlled by the delivery of heat to the ice sheet margins, particularly to ocean cavities beneath ice shelves and to calving fronts . The amount of heat delivered is a function of the temperature and salinity of ocean waters; ocean circulation; and the bathymetry of continental shelves, in fjords near glacier fronts and beneath ice shelves, most of which are not known in sufficient detail . Changes in any of these parameters would have a direct and rapid impact on melt rates and potentially on calving fluxes . Ice grounded on a reverse bed-slope, deepening towards the ice sheet interior, is potentially subject to the marine ice sheet instability  . Much of the bed of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  lies below sea level and on a reverse bed-slope, with basins extending to depths greater than 2 km . The marine parts of the WAIS contain ~3.4 m of equivalent sea level rise , and a variety of evidence strongly suggests that the ice sheet volume has been much smaller than present in the last 1 million years, during periods with temperatures similar to those predicted in the next century  . Potentially unstable marine ice sheets also exist in East Antarctica, for example, in Wilkes Land , and these contain more ice than WAIS . In northern Greenland, ice is also grounded below sea level, with reverse slopes . Observations since AR4 confirm that rapid changes are indeed occurring at the marine margins of ice sheets, and that these changes have been observed to penetrate hundreds of kilometres inland . The Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica is grounded significantly below sea level and is the region of Antarctica changing most rapidly at present. Pine Island Glacier has sped up 73% since 1974  and has thinned throughout 1995-2008 at increasing rates  due to grounding line retreat. There is medium confidence that retreat was caused by the intrusion of warm ocean water into the sub-ice shelf cavity . The neighbouring Thwaites, Smith and Kohler glaciers are also speeding-up, thinning and contributing to increasing mass loss . The present rates of thinning are more than one order of magnitude larger than millennial-scale thinning rates in this area . Changes in velocity, elevation, thickness and grounding line position observed in the past two to three decades in the Pine Island/	0
Thwaites Glacier sector are not inconsistent with the development of a marine ice sheet instability triggered by a change in climate forcing, but neither are they inconsistent solely with a response to external environmental  forcing. In Greenland, there is medium confidence that the recent rapid retreat of Jakobshavn Isbrae was caused by the intrusion of warm ocean water beneath the floating ice tongue  combined with other factors, such as weakening of the floating mixture of sea ice, iceberg debris and blown snow within ice rifts . There is medium confidence that recent variations in southeast Greenland's glaciers have been caused by intrusion of warm waters of subtropical origin into glacial fjords. Since AR4 it has become clear that the mid-2000s speed up of southeast Greenland glaciers, which caused a doubling of ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet , was a pulse that was followed by a partial slow down . Although changes in elevation in the north are not as large as in the south, marine sectors were thinning in 2003-2008 . In contrast to the rapidly changing marine margins of the ice sheets, land-terminating regions of the Greenland ice sheet are changing more slowly, and these changes are explained largely by changes in the input of snow and loss of meltwater . Surface meltwater, although abundant on the Greenland ice sheet, does not seem to be driving significant changes in basal lubrication that impact on ice sheet flow . In Greenland, the observed changes are not all irreversible. The Helheim Glacier in southeast Greenland accelerated, retreated and increased its calving flux during the period 2002-2005 , but its calving flux similarly increased during the late 1930s - early 1940s : an episode from which the glacier subsequently recovered and re-advanced . The collapse of the floating tongue of Jakobshavn Isbrae in 2002 and consequent loss of buttressing has considerably increased ice flow speeds and discharge from the ice sheet. At present, the glacier grounding line is retreating 0.5-0.6 km yr-1 , with speeds in excess of 11 km yr-1 , and the glacier is retreating on a bed that deepens further inland, which could be conducive to a marine instability. However, there is evidence that Jakobshavn Isbrae has undergone significant margin changes over the last approximately 8000 years which may have been both more and less extensive than the recent ones . Since AR4, many new observations indicate that changes in ice sheets can happen more rapidly than was previously recognised. Similarly, evidence presented since AR4 indicates that interactions with both the atmosphere and ocean are key drivers of decadal ice-sheet change. So, although our understanding of the detailed processes that control the evolution of ice sheets in a warming climate remains incomplete, there is no indication in observations of a slowdown in the mass loss from ice sheets; instead, recent observations suggest an ongoing increase in mass loss. 357	0
Snowfall is a component of total precipitation and, in that context, is discussed in Chapter 2 ; here we discuss accumulated snow as a climatological indicator. Snow is measured using a variety of instruments and techniques, and reported using several metrics, including snow cover extent ; the seasonal sum of daily snowfall; snow depth ; snow cover duration , that is, number of days with snow exceeding a threshold depth; or snow water equivalent . Long-duration, consistent records of snow are rare owing to many challenges in making accurate and representative measurements. Although weather stations in snowy inhabited areas often report snow depth, records of snowfall are often patchy or use techniques that change over time . The density of stations and the choice of metric also varies considerably from country to country. The longest satellite-based record of SCE is the visible-wavelength weekly product of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  dating to 1966 , but this covers only the NH. Satellite mapping of snow depth and SWE has lower accuracy than SCE, especially in mountainous and heavily forested areas. Measurement challenges are particularly acute in the Southern Hemisphere , where only about 11 long-duration in situ records continue to recent times: seven in the central Andes and four in southeast Australia. Owing to concerns about quality and duration, global satellite microwave retrievals of SWE are of less use in the data-rich NH than in the data-poor SH.	0
By blending in situ and satellite records, Brown and Robinson  have updated a key indicator of climate change, namely the time series of NH SCE . This time series shows significant reductions over the past 90 years with most of the reductions occurring in the 1980s, and is an improvement over that presented in AR4 in several ways, not least because the uncertainty estimates are explicitly derived through the statistical analysis of multiple data sets, which leads to very high confidence. Snow cover decreases are largest in spring , and the rate of decrease increases with latitude in response to larger albedo feedbacks . Averaged March and April NH SCE decreased 0.8%  per decade over the 1922-2012 period, 1.6%  per decade over the 1967-2012 period, and 2.2%  per decade over the 1979-2012 period. In a new development since AR4, both absolute and relative losses in June SCE now exceed the losses in March-April SCE: 11.7% 	0
per decade or 53%  total over the 1967-2012 period and 14.8%  per decade over the 1979-2012 period . Note that these percentages differ from those given by Brown and Robinson  which were calculated relative to the mean over the 1979-2000 period, rather than relative to the starting point. The loss rate of June SCE exceeds the loss rate for Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  model projections of June SCE and also exceeds the well-known loss of September sea ice extent . Viewed another way, the NOAA SCE data indicate that, owing to earlier spring snowmelt, the duration of the snow season averaged over NH grid points declined by 5.3 days per decade since winter 1972-1973 . Over Eurasia, in situ data show significant increases in winter snow accumulation but a shorter snowmelt season . From analysis of passive microwave satellite data since 1979, significant trends toward a shortening of the snowmelt season have been identified over much of Eurasia  and the pan-Arctic region , with a trend toward earlier melt of about 5 days per decade for the beginning of the melt season, and a trend of about 10 days per decade later for the end of the melt season. The correlation between spring temperature and SCE  demonstrates that trends in spring SCE are linked to rising temperature, and for a well-understood reason: The spring snow cover-albedo feedback. This feedback contributes substantially to the hemispheric response to rising greenhouse gases and provides a useful test of global	0
snowmelt, or both. However, unravelling the competing effects of rising temperatures and changing precipitation remains an important challenge in understanding and interpreting observed changes. Figure 4.21 shows a compilation of many published trends observed at individual locations; data were obtained either from tables in the published papers, or  directly from the author, in some cases including updates to the published data sets. The figure shows that in most studies, a majority of sites experienced declines during the varying periods of record, and where data on site mean temperature or elevation were available, warmer/lower sites  were more likely to experience declines.	0
climate models  . Indeed, the observed declines in land snow cover and sea ice have contributed roughly the same amount to changes in the surface energy fluxes, and the albedo feedback of the NH cryosphere is likely in the range 0.3 to 1.1 W m-2 K-1 . Brown et al.  used satellite, reanalyses and in situ observations to document variability and trend in Arctic spring  SCE over the 1967-2008 period. In June, with Arctic albedo feedback at a maximum, SCE decreased 46%  and air temperature explains 56% of the variability. For the SH, as noted above , there are no correspondingly long visible-wavelength satellite records, but microwave data date from 1979. Foster et al.  presented the first satellite study of variability and trends in any measure of snow for South America, in this case SWE from microwave data. They focused on the May-September period and noted large year-to-year variability and some lower frequency variability--the July with most extensive snow cover had almost six times as much as the July with the least extensive snow cover--but identified no trends.	0
Some in situ studies in addition to those in Figure 4.21 deserve discussion. Ma and Qin  described trends by season at 754 stations aggregated by region in China over 1951-2009; they found statistically significant trends: positive in winter SD in northwest China, and negative in SD and SWE in spring for China as a whole and spring SWE for the Qinghai-Xizang  Plateau. Marty and Meister  noted changes at six high-elevation  sites in the European Alps of Switzerland, Austria, and Germany, consistent with Figure 4.21: no change in SD in midwinter, shortening of SCD in spring and reduction in spring SWE and SD coincident with warming. For the Pyrenees, Lopez-Moreno and Vicente-Serrano  derived proxy SD for 106 sites since 1950 from actual SD measurements since 1985 and weather measurements; they noted declines in spring SD that were related to changes in atmospheric circulation. In the SH, of seven records in the Andes, none have significant trends in maximum SWE  over their periods of record. Of four records in Australia discussed in AR4, all show decreases in spring SWE over their respective periods of record , and the only one that has been updated since the Nicholls  paper shows a statistically significant decrease of 37% .	0
In addition to reductions in snow cover extent, which will reduce the mean reflectivity of particular regions, the reflectivity  of the snow itself may also be changing in response to human activities. Unfortunately, there are extremely limited data on the changes of albedo over time, and we must rely instead on analyses from ice cores, direct recent observations, and modelling. Flanner et al. , using a detailed snow radiative model coupled to a global climate model and estimates of biomass burning, estimated that the human-induced radiative forcing by deposition of black carbon on snow cover is +0.054  W m-2 globally, of which 80% is from fossil fuels. However, spatially comprehensive surveys of impurities in Arctic snow in the late 2000s and mid-1980s suggested that impurities decreased between those two periods  and hence albedo changes have probably not made a significant contribution to recent reductions in Arctic ice and snow.	0

Box 4.1 | Interactions of Snow within the Cryosphere Snow is just one component of the cryosphere, but snow also sustains ice sheets and glaciers, and has strong interactions with all the other cryospheric components, except sub-sea permafrost. For example, snow can affect the rate of sea-ice production, and can alter frozen ground through its insulating effect. Snowfall and the persistence of snow cover are strongly dependent on atmospheric temperature and precipitation, and are thus likely to change in complex ways in a changing climate . For the Earth's climate in general, and more specifically, the cryospheric components on which snow falls, the two most important physical properties of snow are its high albedo  and its low thermal conductivity, which results because its high air content makes it an excellent thermal insulator. Both factors substantially alter the flux of energy between the atmosphere and the material beneath the snow cover. Snow also has a major impact on the total energy balance of the Earth's surface because large regions in the NH are seasonally covered by snow . When seasonal snow melts it is also an important fresh water resource. The high albedo of snow has a strong impact on the radiative energy balance of all surfaces on which it lies, most of which  are much less reflective. For example, the albedo of bare glacier or sea ice is typically only 20 to 30%, and hence 	0
70 to 80% of solar radiation is absorbed at the surface. For ice at the melting point, this energy melts the ice. With a fresh snow cover over ice, the albedo changes to 80% or even higher and melting is greatly reduced . The effect is similar for other land surfaces--bare soil, frozen ground, low-lying vegetation--but here the thermal properties of the snow cover also play an important role by insulating the ground from changes in ambient air temperature. While an insulating snow cover can reduce the growth of sea ice, a heavy snow load, particularly in the Antarctic, often depresses the sea ice surface below sea level and this leads to faster transformation of snow to ice . Even without flooding, the basal snow layer on Antarctic sea ice tends to be moist and saline because brine is wicked up through the snow cover. In regions of heavily ridged and deformed sea ice, snow redistributed by wind smoothes the ice surface, reducing the drag of the air on the ice and thus slowing ice drift and reducing heat exchange  . For frozen ground, the insulation characteristics of snow cover are particularly important. If the air above is colder than the material on which it lies, the presence of snow will reduce heat transfer upwards, especially for fresh snow with a low density. This could, for example, reduce the seasonal freezing of soil, slow down the freezing of the active layer  or protect permafrost from cooling. Alternatively, if the air is warmer than the material beneath the snow, heat transfer downwards from the air is reduced and the presence of snow cover can increase the thickness of seasonal soil freeze and protect permafrost from warming. Which process applies depends on the timing of the snowfall, its thickness, and its duration . For the preceding reasons, the timing of snowfall and the persistence of snow cover are of major importance. Whereas snow falling on glaciers and ice sheets in summer has a strongly positive  effect on the mass budget, early snow cover can reduce radiative and conductive cooling and freezing of the active layer. During winter, snowfall is the most important source of nourishment for most glaciers, but radiative cooling of frozen ground is strongly reduced by thick snow cover .	0
The assessment of changes in lake and river ice is made more difficult by several factors. Until the satellite era, some nations collected data from numerous lakes and rivers and others none; many published studies focus on a single lake or river. Many records have been discontinued , and consistency of observational methods is a challenge, especially for date of ice break-up of ice on rivers when the process of break-up can take as long as 3 months . The most comprehensive description is the analysis of 75 lakes, mostly in Scandinavia and the northern USA, but with one each in Switzerland and Russia . Examining 150-, 100-, and 30-year periods ending in spring 2005, they found the most rapid changes in the most recent 30-year period  with trends in freeze-up 1.6 days per decade later and breakup 1.9 days per decade earlier. Wang et al.  found a total ice cover reduction on the north American Great Lakes of 71% over the 1973-2010 period of record, using weekly ice charts derived from satellite observations . Jensen et al.  examined data from 65 water bodies in the Great Lakes region between Minnesota and New York  and found trends in freeze-up 3.3 days per decade later, trends in breakup 2.1 days per decade earlier, and rates of change over 1975-2004 that were bigger than those over 1846-1995. Spatial patterns in trends are ambiguous: Latifovic and Pouliot  found larger trends in higher latitudes over Canada, but Hodgkins et al.  found larger trends in lower latitudes in the northeastern USA.	0
In the only reported study since the 1990s of ice on SH lakes, Green  suggested on the basis of available evidence that break-up of ice cover on Blue Lake in the Snowy Mountains of Australia had shifted from November to October between observation periods 1970-1972 and 1998-2010. Several studies made quantitative connections between ice cover and temperature. For instance, Benson et al.  found significant correlations between mean ice duration and mean NH land air temperature in fall-winter-spring  and between spring air temperature and breakup ; see also the review by Prowse et al. . Studies of changes in river ice have used both disparate data and time intervals, ranging in duration from multi-decade to more than two centuries, and most focus on a single river. Beltaos and Prowse , summarizing most available information for northern rivers, noted an almost universal trend towards earlier break-up dates but considerable spatial variability in those for freeze-up, and noted too that changes were often more pronounced during the last few decades of the 20th century. They noted that the 20th century increase in mean air temperature in spring and autumn has produced in many areas a change of about 10 to 15 days toward earlier break-up and later freeze-up, although the relationship with air temperatures is complicated by the roles of snow accumulation and spring runoff. In summary, the limited evidence available for freshwater  ice indicates that ice duration is decreasing and average seasonal ice cover shrinking , and the following general patterns : rates of change in timing are 361	0
high Arctic regions and gradually increase southwards, but substantial differences do occur at the same latitude. For example, as a result of the proximity to warm ocean currents, the southern limit of permafrost is farther north, and permafrost temperature is higher in Scandinavia and north-western Russia than it is in Arctic regions of Siberia and North America . In Russia, permafrost temperature measurements reach back to the early 1930s , in North America to the late 1940s  and in China to the early 1960s . Systematic measurements, however, began mostly in the late 1970s and early 1980s . In addition, since the AR4, considerable effort  has gone into enhancing the observation network and establishing a baseline against which future changes in permafrost can be measured . However, it should be noted that there still exist comparatively few measurements of permafrost temperature in the SH .	0
Both the temperature and extent of permafrost are highly sensitive to climate change, but the responses may be complex and highly heterogeneous . Similarly, the annual freezing and thawing of seasonally frozen ground is coupled to the land surface energy and moisture fluxes, and thus to climate. Since, permafrost and seasonally frozen ground, can contain significant fractions of ice, changes in landscapes, ecosystems and hydrological processes can occur when it forms or degrades . Furthermore, frozen organic soils contain considerable quantities of carbon, more than twice the amount currently in the atmosphere , and permafrost thawing exposes previously frozen carbon to microbial degradation and releases radiatively active gases, such as carbon dioxide  and methane , into the atmosphere  . Similarly, recent evidence suggests that degradation of permafrost may also permit the release of nitrous oxide , which is also radiatively active . Finally, permafrost degradation may directly affect the lives of people, both in northern and high-mountain areas, through impacts on the landscape, vegetation and infrastructure .	0
4.7.2.1 Permafrost Temperature The ice content and temperature of permafrost are the key parameters that determine its physical state. Permafrost temperature is a key parameter used to document changes to permafrost. Permafrost temperature measured at a depth where seasonal variations cease to occur is generally used as an indicator of long-term change and to represent the mean annual ground temperature . For most sites this depth occurs in the upper 20 m. In the SH, permafrost temperatures as low as -23.6C have been observed in the Antarctic , but in the NH, permafrost temperatures generally range from -15C to close to the freezing point  . They are usually coldest in 362	0
Figure 4.22 | Time series of mean annual ground temperatures at depths between 10 and 20 m for boreholes throughout the circumpolar northern permafrost regions . Data sources are from Romanovsky et al.  and Christiansen et al. . Measurement depth is 10 m for Russian boreholes, 15 m for Gulkana and Oldman, and 20 m for all other boreholes. Borehole locations are: ZS-124, 67.48N 063.48E; 85-8A, 61.68N 121.18W; Gulkana, 62.28N 145.58W; YA-1, 67.58N 648E; Oldman, 66.48N 150.68W; Happy Valley, 69.18N 148.88W; Svalbard, 78.28N 016.58E; Deadhorse, 70.28N 148.58W and West Dock, 70.48N 148.58W. The rate of change  in permafrost temperature over the period of each site record is: ZS-124: 0.53  0.07; YA-1: 0.21  0.02; West Dock: 0.64  0.08; Deadhorse: 0.82  0.07; Happy Valley: 0.34  0.05; Gaibrath Lake: 0.35  0.07; Gulkana: 0.15  0.03; Old Man: 0.40  0.04 and Svalvard: 0.63  0.09. 	0
sometimes nearly isothermal with depth; as is observed in mountain regions such as the European Alps , Scandinavia , the Western Cordillera of North America , the Qinghai-Xizang  Plateau  and in the northern high latitudes in the southern margins of discontinuous permafrost regions . In such areas, permafrost temperatures have shown little or no change, indicating that permafrost is thawing internally but remaining very close to the melting point . Cooling of permafrost due to atmospheric temperature fluctuations has been observed; for example, in the eastern Canadian Arctic until the mid-1990s ; but some examples have been short-lived and others controlled by site-specific conditions . In at least one case in the Antarctic, permafrost warming has been observed in a region with almost stable air temperatures .	0
4.7.2.2 Permafrost Degradation Permafrost degradation refers to a decrease in thickness and/or areal extent. In particular, the degradation can be manifested by a deepening of summer thaw, or top-down or bottom-up permafrost thawing, and a development of taliks . Other manifestations of degradation include geomorphologic changes such as the formation of thermokarst terrain , expansion of thaw lakes  active-layer detachment slides along slopes, rock falls , and destabilized rock glaciers . Although most permafrost has been degrading since the Little Ice Age , the trend was relatively modest until the past two decades, during which the rate of degradation has increased in some regions .	0
Significant permafrost degradation has been reported in the Russian European North . Warm permafrost with a thickness of 10 to 15 m thawed completely in the period 1975-2005 in the Vorkuta area . And although boundaries between permafrost types are not easy to map, the southern permafrost boundary in this region is reported to have moved north by about 80 km and the boundary of continuous permafrost has moved north by 15 to 50 km  . Taliks have also developed in relatively thick permafrost during the past several decades. In the Vorkuta region, the thickness of existing closed taliks increased by 0.6 to 6.7 m over the past 30 years . Permafrost thawing and talik formation has occurred in the Nadym and Urengoy regions in north- western Russian . Long-term permafrost thawing has been reported around the city of Yakutsk, but this in this case, the thawing may have been caused mainly by forest fires or human disturbance . Permafrost degradation has also been reported on the Qinghai-Xizang  Plateau . Coastal erosion and permafrost degradation appear to be evident along many Arctic coasts in recent years, with complex interactions between them . In part, these interactions arise from the thermal and chemical impact of sea water on cold terrestrial permafrost . Similar impacts arise for permafrost beneath new thaw lakes, which have been formed in recent years . In northern Alaska, estimates of permafrost thawing under thaw lakes are in the range 0.9 to 1.7 cm a-1 . Since AR4, destabilized rock glaciers have received increased attention from researchers. A rock glacier is a mass of perennially frozen rock fragments on a slope, that contains ice in one or more forms and shows evidence of past or present movement . Time series acquired over recent decades by terrestrial surveys indicate acceleration of some rock glaciers as well as seasonal velocity changes related to ground temperatures (Bodin et al., 2009; 364	0
Subsea permafrost is similar to its terrestrial counterpart, but lies beneath the coastal seas. And as with terrestrial permafrost, subsea permafrost is a substantial reservoir and/or a confining layer for gas hydrates . It is roughly estimated that subsea permafrost contains 2 to 65 Pg of CH4 hydrate . Observations of gas release on the East Siberian Shelf and high methane concentrations in water-column and air above  have led to the suggestion that permafrost thawing creates pathways for gas release. Subsea permafrost in the Arctic is generally relict terrestrial permafrost , inundated after the last glaciation and now degrading under the overlying shelf sea. Permafrost may, however, also form when the sea is shallow, permitting sediment freezing through bottom-fast winter sea ice . A 76-year record of bottom water temperature in the Laptev Sea  showed warming of 2.1C since 1985 in the nearshore zone , as lengthening summers reduced sea ice extent and increased solar heating. Degradation rates of the ice-bearing permafrost following inundation have been estimated to be 1 to 20 cm a-1 on the East Siberian Shelf  and 1 to 4 cm a-1 in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea .	0
al., 2010). The ALT has increased significantly in the Russian European North , East Siberia , and Chukotka  since the mid-1990s. Burn and Kokelj  found, for a site in the Mackenzie Delta area, that ALT increased by 8 cm between 1983 and 2008, although the record does exhibit high interannual variability as has been observed at other sites in the region . ALT has increased since the mid1990s in the eastern portion of the Canadian Arctic, with the largest increase occurring at bedrock sites in the discontinuous permafrost zone . The interannual variations and trends of the active-layer thickness in Northern America, Northern Europe and Northern Asia from 1990 to 2012 are presented in Figure 4.23. Large regional variations in the yearly variability patterns and trends are apparent. While increases in ALT are occurring in the Eastern Canadian Region , a slightly declining trend is observed in the Western Canadian Region . In Northern Europe, the trends in the study areas are similar and consistently positive . On the other hand, in Northern Asia, trends are generally strongly positive with the exception of West Siberia, where the trend is slightly negative . On the interior of Alaska, slightly increasing ALT from 1990 to 2010 was followed by anomalous increases in 2011 and in 2012. Overall, a general increase in ALT since the 1990s has been observed at many stations in many regions . The general increase is shown in Figure 4.23d, which shows the results of analysis of data from about 44 stations in Russia indicating a change of almost 0.2 m from 1950 to 2008. At some measurement sites on the Qinghai-Xizang  Plateau, ALT was reported to be increasing at 7.8 cm yr-1 over a period from 1995 through 2010 . The high rates may have been the result of local disturbances since more recent studies indicate rates of 1.33 cm yr-1 for the period 1981-2010 and 3.6 cm yr-1 for the period 1998-2010 .	0
During the past decade, increases in ALT up to 4.0 cm yr-1 were observed in Mongolian sites characterized as a warm permafrost region . Changes in ALT were also detected in Tian Shan , and in the European Alps, where increases in ALT were largest during years of hot summers but a strong dependence on surface and subsurface characteristics was noted . In several areas, across North America and in West Siberia, large-inter annual variations obscure any trends in ALT . No trend in ALT was observed on the Alaskan North Slope from 1993 to 2010  and also in the Mackenzie Valley  and in West Siberia  since the mid-1990s . At some sites, such as at Western Canada  and Western Siberia  , the active layer thickness was actually decreasing.	0

The dashed lines represents linear fit to each set of data. ALT data for Northern America, Northern Asia and Northern Europe were obtained from the International Permafrost Association  CALM website . The number of Russian Hydrometeorological Stations  stations has expanded from 31 stations as reported from Frauenfeld et al.  and Zhang et al.  to 44 stations and the time series has extended from 1990 to 2008.  Departures from the mean of active layer thickness in Siberia from 1950 to 2008.

selected sites on the North Slope of Alaska indicate 11 to 13 cm in surface subsidence over the period 2001-2006 , 4 to 10 cm from 2003 to 2005 in the Brooks Range  and up to 20 cm in the Russian European North . Subsidence has also been identified using space-borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar  data. Surface deformation was detected using InSAR over permafrost on the North Slope of Alaska during the 1992-2000 thaw seasons and a long-term surface subsidence of 1 to 4 cm per decade . Such subsidence could explain why in situ measurements at some locations reveal negligible trends in ALT changes during the past two decades, despite the fact that atmospheric and permafrost temperatures increased during that time.	0
of seasonally frozen ground decreased by about 0.32 m during the period 1930-2000  . Inter-decadal variability was such that no trend could be identified until the late 1960s, after which seasonal freeze depths decreased significantly until the early 1990s. From then, until about 2008, no further change was evident. Such changes are closely linked with the freezing index, but also with mean annual air temperatures and snow depth . Thickness of seasonally frozen ground in western China decreased by 20 to 40 cm since the early 1960s , whereas on the Qinghai-Xizang  Plateau, the seasonally frozen depth decreased by up to 33 cm since the middle of 1980s . Evidence from the satellite record indicates that the onset dates of spring thaw advanced by 14 days, whereas the autumn freeze date was delayed by 10 days on the Qinghai-Xizang  Plateau from 1988 through 2007 	0
Figure 4.24 | Annual anomalies of the average thickness of seasonally frozen depth in Russia from 1930 to 2000. Each data point represents a composite from 320 stations as compiled at the Russian Hydrometeorological Stations  . The composite was produced by taking the sum of the thickness measurements from each station and dividing the result by the number of stations operating in that year. Although the total number of stations is 320, the number providing data may be different for each year but the minimum was 240. The yearly anomaly was calculated by subtracting the 1971-2000 mean from the composite for each year. The thin lines indicate the 1 standard deviation   uncertainty range. The line shows a negative trend of -4.5 cm per decade or a total decrease in the thickness of seasonally frozen ground of 31.9 cm from 1930 to 2000 .	0
Frozen Ground: increasing permafrost temperatures by up to 2C and active layer thickness by up to 90 cm since early 1980s. In the NH, southern limit of permafrost moving north since mid 1970s, and decreasing thickness of seasonal frozen ground by 32 cm since 1930s. Snow cover: between 1967 and 2012, satellite data show decreases through the year, with largest decreases  in June. Most stations report decreases in now especially in spring. Lake and river ice: contracting winter ice duration with delays in autumn freeze-up proceeding more slowly than advances in spring break-up, with evidence of recent acceleration in both across the NH. Glaciers: are major contributors to sea level rise. Ice mass loss from glaciers has increased since the 1960s. Loss rates from glaciers outside Greenland and Antarctica -1 were 0.76 mm yr SLE during the 1993 to 2009 period -1 and 0.83 mm yr SLE over the 2005 to 2009 period.	0
Some of the observed changes since AR4 have been considerable and unexpected. One of the most visible was the dramatic decline in the September minimum sea ice cover in the Arctic in 2007, which was followed by a record low value in 2012, supporting observations that the thicker components of the Arctic sea ice cover are decreasing. The trend in extent for Arctic sea ice is -3.8  0.3% per decade  while that for multi-year ice is -13.5  2.5% per decade . Observations also show marked decreases in Arctic ice thickness and volume. The pattern of melt on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet has also changed radically, with melt occurring in 2012 over almost the entire surface of the ice sheet for the first time during the satellite era. The ice mass loss in Greenland has been observed to have increased from 34  Gt yr-1 for the period 1992-2001 to 215  Gt yr-1 for the period 2002-2011 while the estimates of mass loss in Antarctica have increased from 30  Gt yr-1 during the 1992-2001 period to 147  Gt yr-1 during the 2002-2011 period. Observed mass loss from glaciers has also increased, with the global mass loss  estimated to be 226  Gt yr-1 during the 1971-2009 period, 275  Gt yr-1 over the 1993-2009 period, and 301  over the 2005-2009 period. A large majority of observing stations report decreasing trends in snow depth, snow duration, or snow water equivalent, and the largest decreases are typically observed at locations with temperatures close to freezing. Most lakes and rivers with long-term records have exhibited declines in ice duration and average seasonal ice cover. Permafrost has also been degrading and retreating to the north while permafrost temperatures have increased in most regions since the 1980s.	0
The observed positive trend of sea ice extent in the Antarctic that was regarded as small and insignificant in AR4, has persisted, and increased slightly to about 1.5  0.2% per decade. The higher-than-average Antarctic sea ice extent in recent years has been mainly due to increases in the Ross Sea region, which more than offset the declines in the Bellingshausen Sea and Amundsen Sea. Ice production in coastal polynyas  along the Ross Sea ice shelves have been observed to be increasing. Recent work suggests strengthening of the zonal  winds and accompanying ice drift accounts for some of the increasing sea ice extent. Satellite data have provided the ability to observe large-scale changes in the cryosphere at relatively good temporal and spatial resolution throughout the globe. Largely because of the availability of high resolution satellite data, the first near-complete global glacial inventory has been generated, leading to a more precise determination of the past, current and future contribution of glaciers to sea level rise. As more data accumulate, and as more capable sensors are launched, the data become more valuable for studies related to change assessment. The advent of new satellites and airborne missions has provided powerful tools that have enabled breakthroughs in the capability to measure some parameters and enhance our ability to interpret results. However, a longer record of measurements of the cryosphere will help increase confidence in the results, reduce uncertainties in the long-term trends, and bring more critical insights into the physical processes controlling the changes. There is thus a need for the continuation of the satellite records, and a requirement for longer and more reliable historical data from in situ measurements and proxies. 368	0
The sea level equivalent of mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets over the period 1993-2010, has been about 5.9 mm  and 4.8 mm, respectively. The reliability of observations of ice loss from the ice sheets has been enhanced with the introduction of advanced satellite observation techniques. The ice loss from glaciers between 1993 and 2009 measured in terms of sea level equivalent  is estimated to be 13 mm. The inset to Figure 4.25 shows the cumulative sea level equivalent from glaciers and the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. These have been contributing dominantly to sea level rise in recent decades. The contribution of the cryosphere to sea level change is discussed more fully in Chapter 13. The overall consistency in the negative changes observed in the various components of the cryosphere , and the acceleration of these changes in recent decades, provides a strong signal of climate change. Regional differences in the magnitude and direction of the signals are apparent, but these are not unexpected considering the large variability and complexity of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. It is very likely, however, that the Arctic has changed substantially since 1979.	0
Global Sea Level Changes During Past Warm Periods There is high confidence that changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration play an important role in glacial-interglacial cycles. Although the primary driver of glacial-interglacial cycles lies in the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of incoming solar energy driven by changes in the geometry of the Earth's orbit around the Sun , reconstructions and simulations together show that the full magnitude of glacial-interglacial temperature and ice volume changes cannot be explained without accounting for changes in atmospheric CO2 content and the associated climate feedbacks. During the last deglaciation, it is very likely2 that global mean temperature increased by 3C to 8C. While the mean rate of global warming was very likely 0.3C to 0.8C per thousand years, two periods were marked by faster warming rates, likely between 1C and 1.5C per thousand years, although regionally and on shorter time scales higher rates may have occurred. With medium confidence, global mean surface temperature was significantly above pre-industrial levels during several past periods characterised by high atmospheric CO2 concentrations. During the mid-Pliocene , atmospheric	0
There is high confidence that minima in NH extratropical glacier extent between 8000 and 6000 years ago were primarily due to high summer insolation . The current glacier retreat occurs within a context of orbital forcing that would be favourable for NH glacier growth. If glaciers continue to reduce at current rates, most extratropical NH glaciers will shrink to their minimum extent, which existed between 8000 and 6000 years ago, within this century . Continental-scale surface temperature reconstructions show, with high confidence, multi-decadal periods during the Medieval Climate Anomaly  that were in some regions as warm as in the mid-20th century and in others as warm as in the 386	0
This chapter assesses the information on past climate obtained prior to the instrumental period. The information is based on data from various paleoclimatic archives and on modelling of past climate, and updates Chapter 6 of AR4 of IPCC Working Group I . The Earth system has responded and will continue to respond to various external forcings  and to changes in atmospheric composition. Paleoclimate data and modelling provide quantitative information on the Earth system response to these forcings. Paleoclimate information facilitates understanding of Earth system feedbacks on time scales longer than a few centuries, which cannot be evaluated from short instrumental records. Past climate changes also document transitions between different climate states, including abrupt events, which occurred on time scales of decades to a few centuries. They inform about multi-centennial to millennial baseline variability, against which the recent changes can be compared to assess whether or not they are unusual. Major progress since AR4 includes the acquisition of new and more precise information from paleoclimate archives, the synthesis of regional information, and Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase III  and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  simulations using the same models as for projections . This chapter assesses the understanding of past climate variations, using paleoclimate reconstructions as well as climate models of varying complexity, while the model evaluation based on paleoclimate information is covered in Chapter 9. Additional paleoclimate perspectives are included in Chapters 6, 10 and 13 .	0
The content of this chapter is largely restricted to topics for which substantial new information has emerged since AR4. Examples include proxy-based estimates of the atmospheric carbon dioxide  content during the past ~65 million years  and magnitude of sea level variations during interglacial periods . Information from glacial climates has been included only if the underlying processes are of direct relevance for an assessment of projected climate change. The impacts of past climate changes on biological systems and past civilizations are not covered, as these topics are beyond the scope of Working Group I. The chapter proceeds from evidence for pre-industrial changes in atmospheric composition and external solar and volcanic forcings , to global and hemispheric responses . After evaluating the evidence for past changes in climate modes of variability , a specific focus is given to regional changes in temperature, cryosphere and hydroclimate during the current interglacial period . Sections on sea level change , abrupt climate changes  and illustrations of irreversibility and recovery time scales  conclude the chapter. While polar amplification of temperature changes is addressed in Box 5.1, the relationships between ice sheets, sea level, atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate are addressed in several sections .	0
Orbital Forcing The term `orbital forcing' is used to denote the incoming solar radiation changes originating from variations in the Earth's orbital parameters as well as changes in its axial tilt. Orbital forcing is well known from precise astronomical calculations for the past and future . Changes in eccentricity, longitude of perihelion  and axial tilt   predominantly affect the seasonal and latitudinal distribution and magnitude of solar energy received at the top of the atmosphere , and the durations and intensities of local seasons. Obliquity also modulates the annual mean insolation at any given latitude, with opposite effects at high and low latitudes. Orbital forcing is considered the pacemaker of transitions between glacials and interglacials , although there is still no consensus on exactly how the different physical processes influenced by insolation changes interact to influence ice sheet volume . The different orbital configurations make each glacial and interglacial period unique . Multi-millennial trends of temperature, Arctic sea ice and glaciers during the current interglacial period, and specifically the last 2000 years, have been related to orbital forcing .	0
Solar Forcing Solar irradiance models  have been improved to explain better the instrumental measurements of total solar irradiance  and spectral  solar irradiance . Typical changes measured over an 11-year solar cycle are 0.1% for TSI and up to several percent for the ultraviolet  part of SSI . Changes in TSI directly impact the Earth's surface , whereas changes in UV primarily affect the stratosphere, but can influence the tropospheric circulation through dynamical coupling . Most models attribute all TSI and SSI changes exclusively to magnetic phenomena at the solar surface , neglecting any potential internal phenomena such as changes in energy transport . The basic concept in solar models is to divide the solar surface into different magnetic features each with a specific radiative flux. The balance of contrasting dark sunspots and bright faculae and magnetic network leads to a higher TSI value during solar cycle maxima and at most wavelengths, but some wavelengths may be out of phase with the solar cycle . TSI and SSI are calculated by adding the radiative fluxes of all features plus the contribution from	0

the magnetically inactive surface. These models can successfully reproduce the measured TSI changes between 1978 and 2003 , but not necessarily the last minimum of 2008 . This approach requires detailed information of all the magnetic features and their temporal changes  . The extension of TSI and SSI into the pre-satellite period poses two main challenges. First, the satellite period  used to calibrate the solar irradiance models does not show any significant longterm trend. Second, information about the various magnetic features at the solar surface decreases back in time and must be deduced from proxies such as sunspot counts for the last 400 years and cosmogenic	0
radionuclides  for the past millennium  and the Holocene  . 10Be and 14C records reflect not only solar activity, but also the geomagnetic field intensity and effects of their respective geochemical cycles and transport pathways . The corrections for these non-solar components, which are difficult to quantify, contribute to the overall error of the reconstructions . TSI reconstructions are characterized by distinct grand solar minima lasting 50 to 100 years  that are superimposed upon long-term changes.

5.2.1.3 Volcanic Forcing Volcanic activity affects global climate through the radiative impacts of atmospheric sulphate aerosols injected by volcanic eruptions . Quantifying volcanic forcing in the pre-satellite period is important for historical and last millennium climate simulations, climate sensitivity estimates and detection and attribution studies. Reconstructions of past volcanic forcing are based on sulphate deposition from multiple ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, combined with atmospheric modelling of aerosol distribution and optical depth. Since AR4, two new reconstructions of the spatial distribution of volcanic aerosol optical depth have been generated using polar ice cores, spanning the last 1500 years  and 1200 years  . Although the relative size of eruptions for the past 700 years is generally consistent among these and earlier studies , they differ in the absolute amplitude of peaks. There are also differences in the reconstructions of Icelandic eruptions, with an ongoing debate on the magnitude of stratospheric inputs for the 1783 Laki eruption . The recurrence time of past large volcanic aerosol injections  by more than 1 W m-2) varies from 3 to 121 years, with long-term mean value of 35 years  and 39 years , and only two or three periods of 100 years without such eruptions since 850. Hegerl et al.  estimated the uncertainty of the RF for a given volcanic event to be approximately 50%. Differences between reconstructions  arise from different proxy data, identification of the type of injection, methodologies to estimate particle distribution and optical depth , and parameterization of scavenging for large events . Key limitations are associated with ice core chronologies , and deposition patterns . A new independent methodology has recently been developed to distinguish between tropospheric and stratospheric volcanic aerosol deposits .

5.2.2.1 Atmospheric Concentrations of Carbon Dioxide, Methane and Nitrous Oxide from Ice Cores Complementing instrumental data, air enclosed in polar ice provides a direct record of past atmospheric well-mixed greenhouse gas  concentrations albeit smoothed by firn diffusion . Since AR4, the temporal resolution of ice core records has been enhanced . During the pre-industrial part of the last 7000 years, millennial  and centennial variations  are recorded . Significant centennial variations in CH4 during the last glacial occur in phase with Northern Hemisphere  rapid climate changes, while millennial CO2 changes coincide with their Southern Hemisphere  bipolar seesaw counterpart . Long-term records have been extended from 650 ka in AR4 to 800 ka  . During the last 800 ka, the pre-industrial ice core WMGHG concentrations stay within well-defined natural limits with maximum interglacial concentrations of approximately 300 ppm, 800 ppb and 300 ppb for CO2, CH4 and N2O, respectively, and minimum glacial concentrations of approximately 180 ppm, 350 ppb, and 200 ppb. The new data show lower than pre-industrial  CO2 concentrations during interglacial periods from 800 to 430 ka  . It is a fact that present-day  concentrations of CO2 , CH4  and N2O   exceed the range of concentrations recorded in the ice core records during the past 800 ka. With very high confidence, the rate of change of the observed anthropogenic WMGHG rise and its RF is unprecedented with respect to the highest resolution ice core record back to 22 ka for CO2, CH4 and N2O, accounting for the smoothing due to ice core enclosure processes . There is medium confidence that the rate of change of the observed anthropogenic WMGHG rise is also unprecedented with respect to the lower resolution records of the past 800 ka. Progress in understanding the causes of past WMGHG variations is reported in Section 6.2. 391	0
FAQ 5.1 | Is the Sun a Major Driver of Recent Changes in Climate? Total solar irradiance  is a measure of the total energy received from the sun at the top of the atmosphere. It varies over a wide range of time scales, from billions of years to just a few days, though variations have been relatively small over the past 140 years. Changes in solar irradiance are an important driver of climate variability  along with volcanic emissions and anthropogenic factors. As such, they help explain the observed change in global surface temperatures during the instrumental period  and over the last millennium. While solar variability may have had a discernible contribution to changes in global surface temperature in the early 20th century, it cannot explain the observed increase since TSI started to be measured directly by satellites in the late 1970s . The Sun's core is a massive nuclear fusion reactor that converts hydrogen into helium. This process produces energy that radiates throughout the solar system as electromagnetic radiation. The amount of energy striking the top of Earth's atmosphere varies depending on the generation and emission of electromagnetic energy by the Sun and on the Earth's orbital path around the Sun. Satellite-based instruments have directly measured TSI since 1978, and indicate that on average, ~1361 W m-2 reaches the top of the Earth's atmosphere. Parts of the Earth's surface and air pollution and clouds in the atmosphere act as a mirror and reflect about 30% of this power back into space. Higher levels of TSI are recorded when the Sun is more active. Irradiance variations follow the roughly 11-year sunspot cycle: during the last cycles, TSI values fluctuated by an average of around 0.1%. For pre-satellite times, TSI variations have to be estimated from sunspot numbers , or from radioisotopes that are formed in the atmosphere, and archived in polar ice and tree rings. Distinct 50- to 100-year periods of very low solar activity--such as the Maunder Minimum between 1645 and 1715--are commonly referred to as grand solar minima. Most estimates of TSI changes between the Maunder Minimum and the present day are in the order of 0.1%, similar to the amplitude of the 11-year variability. How can solar variability help explain the observed global surface temperature record back to 1870? To answer this question, it is important to understand that other climate drivers are involved, each producing characteristic patterns of regional climate responses. However, it is the combination of them all that causes the observed climate change. Solar variability and volcanic eruptions are natural factors. Anthropogenic  factors, on the other hand, include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, and emissions of visible air pollution  and other substances from human activities. `Internal variability' refers to fluctuations within the climate system, for example, due to weather variability or phenomena like the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The relative contributions of these natural and anthropogenic factors change with time. FAQ 5.1, Figure 1 illustrates those contributions based on a very simple calculation, in which the mean global surface temperature variation represents the sum of four components linearly related to solar, volcanic, and anthropogenic forcing, and to internal variability. Global surface temperature has increased by approximately 0.8C from 1870 to 2010 . However, this increase has not been uniform: at times, factors that cool the Earth's surface--volcanic eruptions, reduced solar activity, most anthropogenic aerosol emissions--have outweighed those factors that warm it, such as greenhouse gases, and the variability generated within the climate system has caused further fluctuations unrelated to external influences.	0
The solar contribution to the record of global surface temperature change is dominated by the 11-year solar cycle, which can explain global temperature fluctuations up to approximately 0.1C between minima and maxima . A long-term increasing trend in solar activity in the early 20th century may have augmented the warming recorded during this interval, together with internal variability, greenhouse gas increases and a hiatus in volcanism. However, it cannot explain the observed increase since the late 1970s, and there was even a slight decreasing trend of TSI from 1986 to 2008 . Volcanic eruptions contribute to global surface temperature change by episodically injecting aerosols into the atmosphere, which cool the Earth's surface . Large volcanic eruptions, such as the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991, can cool the surface by around 0.1C to 0.3C for up to three years. 	0

Geological proxies provide indirect information on atmospheric CO2 concentrations for time intervals older than those covered by ice core records . Since AR4, the four primary proxy CO2 methods have undergone further development . A reassessment of biological respiration and carbonate formation has reduced CO2 reconstructions based on fossil soils by approximately 50% . Bayesian statistical techniques for calibrating leaf stomatal density reconstructions produce consistently higher CO2 estimates than previously assessed , resulting in more convergence between estimates from these two terrestrial proxies. Recent CO2 reconstructions using the boron isotope proxy provide an improved understanding of foraminifer species effects and evolution of seawater alkalinity  and seawater boron isotopic composition . Quantification of the phytoplankton cell-size effects on carbon isotope fractionation has also improved the consistency of the alkenone method . These proxies have also been applied more widely and at higher temporal resolution to a range of geological archives, resulting in an increased number of atmospheric CO2 estimates since 65 Ma . Although there is improved consensus between the proxy CO2 estimates, especially the marine proxy estimates, a significant degree of variation among the different techniques remains. All four techniques have been included in the assessment, as there is insufficient knowledge to discriminate between different proxy estimates on the basis of confidence .	0
In the time interval between 65 and 23 Ma, all proxy estimates of CO2 concentration span a range of 300 ppm to 1500 ppm . An independent constraint on Early Eocene atmospheric CO2 concentration is provided by the occurrence of the sodium carbonate mineral nahcolite, in about 50 Ma lake sediments, which precipitates in association with halite at the sediment-water interface only at CO2 levels >1125 ppm , and thus provides a potential lower bound for atmospheric concentration  during the warmest period of the last 65 Ma, the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum , which is inconsistent with lower estimates from stomata and paleosoils. Although the reconstructions indicate a general decrease in CO2 concentrations since about 50 Ma , the large scatter of proxy data precludes a robust assessment of the second-order variation around this overall trend. Since 23 Ma, CO2 proxy estimates are at pre-industrial levels with exception of the Middle Miocene climatic optimum  and the Pliocene , which have higher concentrations. Although new CO2 reconstructions for the Pliocene based on marine proxies have produced consistent estimates mostly in the range 350 ppm to 450 ppm , the uncertainties associated with these marine estimates remain difficult to quantify. Several boron-derived data sets agree within error  with the ice core records , but alkenone data for the ice core period are outside the error limits . We conclude that there is medium confidence that CO2 levels were above pre-industrial interglacial concentration  394	0
Past changes in mineral dust aerosol  are important for estimates of climate sensitivity  and for its supply of nutrients, especially iron to the Southern Ocean . MDA concentration is controlled by variations in dust sources, and by changes in atmospheric circulation patterns acting on its transport and lifetime. Since AR4, new records of past MDA flux have been obtained from deep-sea sediment and ice cores. A 4 million-year MDA-flux reconstruction from the Southern Ocean  implies reduced dust generation and transport during the Pliocene compared to Holocene levels, followed by a significant rise around 2.7 Ma when NH ice volume increased . Central Antarctic ice core records show that local MDA deposition fluxes are ~20 times higher during glacial compared to interglacial periods . This is due to enhanced dust production in southern South America and perhaps Australia . The impact of changes in MDA lifetime  on dust fluxes in Antarctica remains uncertain . Equatorial Pacific glacial-interglacial MDA fluxes co-vary with Antarctic records, but with a glacial-interglacial ratio in the range of approximately three to four , attributed to enhanced dust production from Asian and northern South American sources in glacial times . The dominant dust source regions  show complex patterns of variability . A glacial increase of MDA source strength by a factor of 3 to 4 requires low vegetation cover, seasonal aridity, and high wind speeds . In Greenland ice cores, MDA ice concentrations are higher by a factor of 100 and deposition fluxes by a factor 20 during glacial periods . This is due mainly to changes in the dust sources for Greenland , increased gustiness  and atmospheric lifetime and transport of MDA . A strong coherence is observed between dust in Greenland ice cores and aeolian deposition in European loess formations . Global data synthesis shows two to four times more dust deposition at the Last Glacial Maximum  than today . Based on data-model comparisons, estimates of global mean LGM dust RF vary from -3 W m-2 to +0.1 W m-2, due to uncertainties in radiative properties. The best estimate value remains at -1 W m-2 as in AR4 . Models may underestimate the MDA RF at high latitudes .	0

Box 5.1 | Polar Amplification Polar amplification occurs if the magnitude of zonally averaged surface temperature change at high latitudes exceeds the globally averaged temperature change, in response to climate forcings and on time scales greater than the annual cycle. Polar amplification is of global concern due to the potential effects of future warming on ice sheet stability and, therefore, global sea level  and carbon cycle feedbacks such as those linked with permafrost melting . Some external climate forcings have an enhanced radiative impact at high latitudes, such as orbital forcing , or black carbon . Here, we focus on the latitudinal response of surface temperature to CO2 perturbations. The magnitude of polar amplification depends on the relative strength and duration of different climate feedbacks, which determine the transient and equilibrium response to external forcings. This box first describes the different feedbacks operating in both polar regions, and then contrasts polar amplification depicted for past high CO2 and low CO2 climates with projected temperature patterns for the RCP8.5 future greenhouse gas  emission scenario. In the Arctic, the sea ice/ocean surface albedo feedback plays an important role . With retreating sea ice, surface albedo decreases, air temperatures increase and the ocean can absorb more heat. The resulting ocean warming contributes to further sea ice melting. The sea ice/ocean surface albedo feedback can exhibit threshold behaviour when temperatures exceed the freezing point of sea ice. This may also translate into a strong seasonality of the response characteristics. Other feedbacks, including water vapour and cloud feedbacks have been suggested as important amplifiers of Arctic climate change . In continental Arctic regions with seasonal snow cover, changes in radiative forcing  can heavily influence snow cover , and thus surface albedo. Other positive feedbacks operating on time scales of decades-to-centuries in continental high-latitude regions are associated with surface vegetation changes  and thawing permafrost . On glacial-to-interglacial time scales, the very slow ice sheet-albedo response to external forcings  is a major contributor to polar amplification in the Northern Hemisphere. An amplified response of Southern Ocean sea surface temperature  to radiative perturbations also emerges from the sea ice- albedo feedback. However, in contrast to the Arctic Ocean, which in parts is highly stratified, mixed-layer depths in the Southern Ocean typically exceed several hundreds of meters, which allows the ocean to take up vast amounts of heat  and damp the SST response to external forcing. This process, and the presence of the ozone hole over the Antarctic ice sheet , can affect the transient response of surface warming of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica, and lead to different patterns of future polar amplification on multi-decadal to multi-centennial time scales. In response to rapid atmospheric CO2 changes, climate models indeed project an asymmetric warming between the Arctic and Southern Oceans, with an earlier response in the Arctic and a delayed response in the Southern Ocean . Above the Antarctic ice sheet, however, surface air temperature can respond quickly to radiative perturbations owing to the limited role of latent heat flux in the surface energy budget of Antarctica. These differences in transient and equilibrium responses of surface temperatures on Antarctica, the Southern Ocean and over continents and oceans in the Arctic domain can explain differences in the latitudinal temperature patterns depicted in Box 5.1, Figure 1 for past periods  and future projections .	0
Box 5.1, Figure 1 illustrates the polar amplification phenomenon for three different periods of the Earth's climate history using temperature reconstructions from natural archives and climate model simulations for:  the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum  characterised by CO2 concentrations of 1000 to 2000 ppm  and the absence of continental ice sheets;  the mid-Pliocene Warm Period , characterized by CO2 concentrations in the range of 350 to 450 ppm  and reduced Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets compared to today ,  the Last Glacial Maximum , characterized by CO2 concentrations around 200 ppm and large continental ice sheets covering northern Europe and North America. Throughout all three time periods, reconstructions and simulations reveal Arctic and Antarctic surface air temperature amplification of up to two times the global mean , and this bipolar amplification appears to be a robust feature of the equilibrium Earth system response to changes of CO2 concentration, irrespective of climate state. The absence , or expansion  of continental ice sheets has the potential to affect the zonally averaged surface temperatures due to the lapse-rate effect , hence contributing to polar amplification. However, polar amplification is also suppressed in zonally averaged gradients of SST compared with terrestrial surface air temperature , owing to the presence of high-latitude sea ice in the pre-industrial control, 	0
which places a lower limit on SST. Global mean temperature estimates for these three past climates also imply an Earth system climate sensitivity to radiative perturbations up to two times higher than the equilibrium climate sensitivity  . Polar amplification explains in part why Greenland Ice Sheet  and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  appear to be highly sensitive to relatively small increases in CO2 concentration and global mean temperature. For example, global sea level during MPWP may have been up to +20m higher than present day when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were ~350 to 450 ppm and global mean surface temperature was 2C to 3C above pre-industrial levels .  	0

Based on earlier climate data-model comparisons, it has been claimed , that models underestimated the strength of polar amplification for high CO2 climates by 30 to 50%. While recent simulations of the EECO and the MPWP exhibit a wide inter-model variability, there is generally good agreement between new simulations and data, particularly if seasonal biases in some of the marine SST proxies from high-latitude sites are considered . Transient polar amplification as recorded in historical instrumental data and as projected by coupled climate models for the 21st century involves a different balance of feedbacks than for the "equilibrium" past states featured in Box 5.1, Figure 1. Since 1875, the Arctic north of 60N latitude has warmed at a rate of 1.36C per century, approximately twice as fast as the global average , and since 1979, Arctic land surface has warmed at an even higher rate of 0.5C per decade  Gridded Dataset of Global Historical Near-Surface Air TEMperature Anomalies Over Land version 4 , Jones et al., 2012; Hadley Centre/CRU gridded surface temperature data set version 4 , Morice et al., 2012) . This recent warming appears unusual in the context of reconstructions spanning the past 2000 years  and has been attributed primarily to anthropogenic factors  . The fact that the strongest warming occurs in autumn and early winter  strongly links Arctic amplification to feedbacks associated with the seasonal reduction in sea ice extent and duration, as well as the insulating effect of sea ice in winter . For future model projections , following the RCP8.5 scenarios, annual mean Arctic  warming is expected to exceed the global average by 2.2 to 2.4 times for the period 2081-2100 compared to 1986-2005 , which corresponds to the higher end of polar amplification implied by paleo-reconstructions. The transient response of Antarctic and Southern Ocean temperatures to the anthropogenic perturbation appears more complex, than for the Arctic region. Zonal mean Antarctic surface warming has been modest at 0.1C per decade over the past 50 years . The Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing one of the strongest regional warming trends , more than twice that of the global mean temperature. Central West Antarctica may have also experienced a similar strong warming trend, as depicted by the only continuous meteorological station during the last 50 years , and borehole measurements spanning the same period . Ice core records show enhanced summer melting in the Antarctic Peninsula since the 1950, which is unprecedented over the past 1000 years , and warming in West Antarctica that cannot be distinguished from natural variability over the last 2000 years  . Polar amplification in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica is virtually absent in the transient CMIP5 RCP4.5 future simulations  , although CMIP5 RCP8.5 exhibits an amplified warming in the Southern Ocean , much smaller in magnitude than the equilibrium response implied from paleo-reconstructions for a high-CO2 world. In summary, high confidence exists for polar amplification in either one or both hemispheres, based on robust and consistent evidence from temperature reconstructions of past climates, recent instrumental temperature records and climate model simulations of past, present and future climate changes.	0
factors such as tectonics and the evolution of biological systems, which play an important role in the carbon cycle . Although new reconstructions of deep-ocean temperatures have been compiled since AR4 , low confidence remains in the precise relationship between CO2 and deep-ocean temperature . Since AR4 new proxy and model data have become available from three Cenozoic warm periods to enable an assessment of forcing, feedbacks and the surface temperature response . These are the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum , the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum  and the mid-Pliocene Warm Period . Reconstructions of surface temperatures based on proxy data remain	0
challenged by  the limited number and uneven geographical distribution of sites,  seasonal biases and  the validity of assumptions required by each proxy method . There is also a lack of consistency in the way uncertainties are reported for proxy climate estimates. In most cases error bars represent the analytical and calibration error. In some compilations qualitative confidence assessments are reported to account for the quality of the age control, number of samples, fossil preservation and abundance, performance of the proxy method utilized and agreement of multiple proxy estimates  Project Members, 2009; Dowsett et al., 2012). The PETM was marked by a massive carbon release and corresponding global ocean acidification  and, with low confidence, global warming of 4C to 7C relative to pre-PETM mean climate . The carbon release of 4500 to 6800 PgC over 5 to 20 kyr translates into a rate of emissions of ~0.5 to 1.0 PgC yr-1 . GHG emissions from marine methane hydrate and terrestrial permafrost may have acted as positive feedbacks . The EECO represents the last time atmospheric CO2 concentrations may have reached a level of ~1000 ppm . There were no substantial polar ice sheets, and oceanic and continental configurations, vegetation type and distribution were significantly different from today. Whereas simulated SAT are in reasonable agreement with reconstructions  , there are still significant discrepancies between simulated and reconstructed mean annual SST, which are reduced if seasonal biases in some of the marine proxies are considered for the high-latitude sites . Medium confidence is placed on the reconstructed global mean surface temperature anomaly estimate of 9C to 14C. The Pliocene is characterized by a long-term increase in global ice volume and decrease in temperature from ~3.3-2.6 Ma , which marks the onset of continental-scale glaciations in the NH. Superimposed on this trend, benthic d18O  and an ice proximal geological archive  imply moderate fluctuations in global ice volume paced by the 41 kyr obliquity cycle. This orbital variability is also evident in far-field sea level reconstructions , tropical Pacific SST  and Southern Ocean MDA records , and indicate a close coupling between temperature, atmospheric circulation and ice volume/sea level . The MPWP and the following 300 kyr represent the last time atmospheric CO2 concentrations were in the range 350 to 450 ppm . Model-data comparisons  provide high confidence that mean surface temperature was warmer than pre-industrial for the average interglacial climate state during the MPWP . Global mean SST is estimated at +1.7C  above the 1901-1920 mean based on large data syntheses . General circulation model  results agree with this SST anomaly , and produce a range of global mean SAT of +1.9C and +3.6C rela-	0
tive to the 1901-1920 mean . Weakened meridional temperature gradients are shown by all GCM simulations, and have significant implications for the stability of polar ice sheets and sea level . SST gradients and the Pacific Ocean thermocline gradient along the equator were greatly reduced compared to present  . Vegetation reconstructions  imply that the global extent of arid deserts decreased and boreal forests replaced tundra, and GCMs predict an enhanced hydrological cycle, but with large inter-model spread . The East Asian Summer Monsoon, as well as other monsoon systems, may have been enhanced at this time . Climate reconstructions for the warm periods of the Cenozoic also provide an opportunity to assess Earth-system and equilibrium climate sensitivities. Uncertainties on both global temperature and CO2 reconstructions preclude deriving robust quantitative estimates from the available PETM data. The limited number of models for MPWP, which take into account slow feedbacks such as ice sheets and the carbon cycle, imply with medium confidence that Earth-system sensitivity may be up to two times the model equilibrium climate sensitivity  . However, if the slow amplifying feedbacks associated with ice sheets and CO2 are considered as forcings rather than feedbacks, climate records of the past 65 Myr yield an estimate of 1.1C to 7C  for ECS  .	0
5.3.2.1 Role of Carbon Dioxide in Glacial Cycles Recent modelling work provides strong support for the important role of variations in the Earth's orbital parameters in generating long-term climate variability. In particular, new simulations with GCMs  support the fundamental premise of the Milankovitch theory that a reduction in NH summer insolation generates sufficient cooling to initiate ice sheet growth. Climate-ice sheet models with varying degrees of complexity and forced by variations in orbital parameters and reconstructed atmospheric CO2 concentrations simulate ice volume variations and other climate characteristics during the last and several previous glacial cycles consistent with paleoclimate records  . There is high confidence that orbital forcing is the primary external driver of glacial cycles . However, atmospheric CO2 content plays an important internal feedback role. Orbital-scale variability in CO2 concentrations over the last several hundred thousand years covaries  with variability in proxy records including reconstructions of global ice volume , climatic conditions in central Asia , tropical  and Southern Ocean SST , Antarctic temperature , deep-ocean temperature , biogeochemical conditions in the North Pacific  and deep-ocean ventilation (Lisiecki 399	0
For the last glacial termination, a large-scale temperature reconstruction  documents that temperature change in the SH lead NH temperature change. This lead can be explained by the bipolar thermal seesaw concept   and the related changes in the inter-hemispheric ocean heat transport, caused by weakening of the Atlantic Ocean meridional overturning circulation  during the last glacial termination . SH warming prior to NH warming can also be explained by the fast sea ice response to changes in austral spring insolation . According to these mechanisms, SH temperature lead over the NH is fully consistent with the NH orbital forcing of deglacial ice volume changes  and the importance of the climate-carbon cycle feedbacks in glacial-interglacial transitions. The tight coupling is further highlighted by the near-zero lag between the deglacial rise in CO2 and averaged deglacial Antarctic temperature recently reported from improved estimates of gas-ice age differences .

Box 5.2 | Climate-Ice Sheet Interactions Ice sheets have played an essential role in the Earth's climate history . They interact with the atmosphere, the ocean-sea ice system, the lithosphere and the surrounding vegetation . They serve as nonlinear filters and integrators of climate effects caused by orbital and GHG forcings , while at the same time affecting the global climate system on a variety of time scales . Ice sheets form when annual snow accumulation exceeds melting. Growing ice sheets expand on previously vegetated areas, thus leading to an increase of surface albedo, further cooling and an increase in net surface mass balance. As ice sheets grow in height and area, surface temperatures drop further as a result of the lapse-rate effect, but also snow accumulation decreases because colder air holds less moisture . This so-called elevation-desert effect  is an important negative feedback for ice sheets which limits their growth. Higher elevation ice sheets can be associated with enhanced calving at their margins, because the ice flow will be accelerated directly by increased surface slopes and indirectly by lubrication at the base of the ice sheet. Calving, grounding line processes, basal lubrication and other forms of thermo-mechanical coupling may have played important roles in accelerating glacial terminations following phases of relatively slow ice sheet growth, hence contributing to the temporal saw-tooth structure of the recent glacial-interglacial cycles . Large glacial ice sheets also deflect the path of the extratropical NH westerly winds , generating anticyclonic circulation anomalies , which tend to warm the western side of the ice sheet and cool the remainder . Furthermore, the orographic effects of ice sheets lead to reorganizations of the global atmosphere circulation by changing the major stationary wave patterns  and trade wind systems . This allows for a fast transmission of ice sheet signals to remote regions. The enormous weight of ice sheets depresses the underlying bedrocks causing a drop in ice sheet height and a surface warming as a result of the lapse-rate effect. The lithospheric adjustment has been shown to play an important role in modulating the ice sheet response to orbital forcing . The presence of terrestrial sedimentary materials  on top of the unweathered bedrock affects the friction at the base of an ice sheet, and may further alter the response of continental ice sheets to external forcings, with impacts on the dominant periodicities of glacial cycles .	0
An area of very active research is the interaction between ice sheets, ice shelves and the ocean . The mass balance of marine ice sheets is strongly determined by ocean temperatures . Advection of warmer waters below ice shelves can cause ice shelf instabilities, reduced buttressing, accelerated ice stream flow  and grounding line retreat in regions with retrograde bedrock slopes , such as West Antarctica. On orbital and millennial time scales such processes may have played an essential role in driving ice volume changes of the West Antarctic ice sheet  and the Laurentide ice sheet . Massive freshwater release from retreating ice sheets, can feed back to the climate system by altering sea level, oceanic deep convection, ocean circulation, heat transport, sea ice and the global atmospheric circulation . Whereas the initial response of ice sheets to external forcings can be quite fast, involving for instance ice shelf processes and outlet glaciers , their long-term adjustment can take much longer  . As a result, the climate-cryosphere system is not even in full equilibrium with the orbital forcing. This also implies that future anthropogenic radiative perturbations over the next century can determine the evolution of the Greenland  and Antarctic ice sheets for centuries and millennia to come with a potential commitment to significant global sea level rise . 	0
synthesis expanded earlier work  by using multiple proxies . The land SAT synthesis is based on pollen data, following the Cooperative Holocene Mapping Project . Climate models and proxy data consistently show that mean annual SST change  is largest in the mid-latitude North Atlantic , and the Mediterranean  . Warming and seasonally ice-free conditions are reconstructed, however, in the northeastern North Atlantic, in the eastern Nordic Seas and north Pacific, albeit with large uncertainty because of the different interpretation of proxy data . SAT reconstructions generally shows year-round cooling, with regional exceptions such as Alaska . Modelling studies show how atmospheric dynamics influenced by ice sheets affect regional temperature patterns in the North 403	0
Atlantic region , and in the north Pacific region . Larger cooling over land compared to ocean is a robust feature of observations and multiple atmosphere-ocean general circulation models  . As in AR4, central Greenland temperature change during the LGM is underestimated by PMIP3/CMIP5 simulations, which show 2C to 18C cooling, compared to 21C to 25C cooling reconstructed from ice core data . A mismatch between reconstructions and model results may arise because of missing Earth system feedbacks   or insufficient integration time to reach an equilibrium for LGM boundary conditions. Uncertainties remain on the magnitude of tropical SST cooling during the LGM. Previous estimates of tropical cooling  are greater than more recent estimates . Such discrepancies may arise from seasonal productivity  and habitat depth  biases. In the western and eastern tropical Pacific, many proxy records show 2C to 3C cooling relative to the pre-in404	0
dustrial period . AOGCMs tend to underestimate longitudinal patterns of tropical SST  and atmospheric circulation . Larger sea ice seasonality is reconstructed for the LGM compared to the pre-industrial period around Antarctica . Climate models underestimate this feature, as well as the magnitude of Southern Ocean cooling  . In Antarctica 7C to 10C cooling relative to the pre-industrial period is reconstructed from ice cores  and captured in most PMIP3/CMIP5 simulations . The combined use of proxy reconstructions, with incomplete spatial coverage, and model simulations is used to estimate LGM global mean temperature change . One recent such study, combining multi-proxy data with multiple AOGCMs, estimates LGM global cooling at 4.0C  0.8C  . This result contrasts with the wider range of global cooling	0
 obtained using Earth-system models of intermediate complexity  . The source of these differences in the estimate of LGM cooling may be the result of  the proxy data used to constrain the simulations, such as data sets associated with mild cooling in the tropics and the North Atlantic;  model resolution and structure, which affects their ability to resolve the land-sea contrast  and polar amplification ;  the experimental design of the simulations, where the lack of dust and vegetation feedbacks  and insufficient integration time. Based on the results and the caveats in the studies assessed here , it is very likely that global mean surface temperature during the LGM was cooler than pre-industrial by 3C to 8C. Some recent AOGCM simulations produce a stronger AMOC under LGM conditions, leading to mild cooling over the North Atlantic and GIS . This finding contrasts with proxy-based information . Changes in deep-ocean temperature and salinity during the LGM have been constrained by pore-water chemistry in deep-sea sediments. For example, pore-water data indicate that deep water in the Atlantic Ocean cooled by between -1.7C  0.9C and -4.5C  0.2C, and became saltier by up to 2.4  0.2 psu in the South Atlantic and at least 0.95  0.07 psu in the North Atlantic . The magnitude of deep-water cooling is supported by other marine proxy data , while the increase in salinity is consistent with independent estimates based on d18O . Average salinity increased due to storage of freshwater in ice sheets. The much larger than average salinity increase in deep Southern Ocean compared to the North Atlantic is probably due to increased salt rejection through sea ice freezing processes around Antarctica  . As a result of prevailing LGM modelling uncertainties  and ambiguities in proxy interpretations , it cannot be determined robustly whether LGM SH westerlies changed in amplitude and position relative to today.	0
5.3.3.2 Last Glacial Maximum Constraints on Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity Temperature change recorded in proxies results from various feedback processes, and external forcings vary before equilibrium of the whole Earth system is reached. Nevertheless, the equilibrium climate sensitivity  can be estimated from past temperatures by explicitly counting the slow components of the processes  as forcings, rather than as feedbacks . This is achieved in three fundamentally different ways ; see also Sections 9.7.3.2 and 10.8.2.4. In the first approach, ECS is estimated by scaling the reconstructed global mean temperature change in the past with the RF difference of the past and 2 x CO2  . The results are subject to uncertainties in the estimate of global mean surface temperature based on proxy records of incomplete spatial coverage . Additional uncertainty is introduced when the sensitivity to LGM forcing is scaled to the sensitivity to 2 x CO2 forcing, as some but not all  models show that these sensitivities differ due to the difference in cloud feedbacks  . In the second approach, an ensemble of LGM simulations is carried out using a single climate model in which each ensemble member differs in model parameters and the ensemble covers a range of ECS  . Model parameters are then constrained by comparison with LGM temperature proxy information, generating a probability distribution of ECS. Although EMICSs are often used in order to attain sufficiently large ensemble size, the uncertainty arising from asymmetric cloud feedbacks cannot be addressed because they are parameterized in the EMICs. In the third approach, multiple GCM simulations are compared to proxy data, and performance of the models and indirectly their ECSs are assessed . Because the cross-model correlation between simulated LGM global cooling	0

Note that the Antarctic ice sheet used for PMIP3 simulations, based on several different methods  differs in elevation from that used in PMIP2 .	0
and ECS is poor , ECS cannot be constrained by the LGM global mean cooling. Models that show weaker sensitivity to LGM forcing than 4 x CO2 forcing in Figure 5.5a tend to show weaker shortwave cloud feedback and hence weaker total feedback under LGM forcing than 4 x CO2 forcing , consistent with previous studies . The relation found between simulated LGM tropical cooling and ECS across multi-GCM  has been used to constrain the ECS with the reconstructed LGM tropical cooling . Again, the main caveats of this approach are the uncertainties in proxy reconstructions and missing dust and vegetation effects which may lead to underestimated LGM cooling in the simulations. Based on these different approaches, estimates of ECS yield low probability for values outside the range 1C to 5C . Even though there is some uncertainty in these studies owing to problems in both the paleoclimate data and paleoclimate modelling as discussed in this section, it is very likely that ECS is greater than 1C, and very unlikely that ECS exceeds 6C.	0
Past interglacials are characterized by different combinations of orbital forcing , atmospheric composition  and climate responses . Documenting natural interglacial climate variability in the past provides a deeper understanding of the physical climate responses to orbital forcing. This section reports on interglacials of the past 800 kyr, with emphasis on the Last Interglacial  which has more data and modelling studies for assessing regional and global temperature changes than earlier interglacials. The LIG sea level responses are assessed in Section 5.6.2. Section 5.5 is devoted to the current interglacial, the Holocene. The phasing and strengths of the precessional parameter and obliquity varied over past interglacials , influencing their timing, duration, and intensity  . Since 800 ka, atmospheric CO2 concentrations during interglacials were systematically higher than during glacial periods. Prior to ~430 ka, ice cores from Antarctica record lower interglacial CO2 concentrations than for the subsequent interglacial periods . While LIG WMGHG concentrations were similar to the pre-industrial Holocene values, orbital conditions were very different with larger latitudinal and seasonal insolation variations. Large eccentricity and the phasing of precession and obliquity  during the LIG resulted in July 65N insolation peaking at ~126 ka and staying above the Holocene maximum values from ~129 to 123 ka. The high obliquity  contributed to small, but positive annual insolation anomalies at high latitudes in both hemispheres and negative anomalies at low latitudes. New data and syntheses from marine and terrestrial archives, with updated age models, have provided an expanded view of temperature patterns during interglacials since 800 ka . There is currently no consensus on whether interglacials changed intensity after ~430 ka. EPICA Dome C Antarctic ice cores record warmer temperatures after	0
this transition  and marine records of deep-water temperatures are characterized by generally higher values during later interglacials than earlier interglacials . In contrast, similar interglacial magnitudes are observed across the ~430 ka boundary in some terrestrial archives from Eurasia . Simulations with an EMIC relate global and southern high latitude mean annual surface temperature variations to changes in CO2 variations, while orbital forcing and associated feedbacks of vegetation and sea ice have a major impact on the simulated northern high-latitude mean annual surface temperature . The highest and lowest interglacial temperatures occur in models when WMGHG concentrations and local insolation reinforce each other . At the time of the AR4, a compilation of Arctic records and two AOGCM simulations allowed an assessment of LIG summer temperature changes. New quantitative data syntheses  now allow estimation of maximum annual surface temperatures around the globe for the LIG . A caveat is that these data syntheses assume that the warmest phases were globally synchronous . However, there is high confidence that warming in the Southern Ocean  and over Antarctica  occurred prior to peak warmth in the North Atlantic, Nordic Seas, and Greenland  community members, 2013). Overall, higher annual temperatures than pre-industrial are reconstructed for high latitudes of both hemispheres. At ~128 ka, East Antarctic ice cores record early peak temperatures ~5C above the present . Higher temperatures are derived for northern Eurasia and Alaska, with sites near the Arctic coast in Northeast Siberia indicating warming of more than 10C as compared to late Holocene . Greenland warming of 8C  4C at 126 ka is estimated from the new Greenland NEEM ice core, after accounting for ice sheet elevation changes . Seasonally open waters off northern Greenland and in the central Arctic are recorded during the LIG . Changes in Arctic sea ice cover  may have affected the Greenland water stable isotope - temperature relationship, adding some uncertainty to LIG Greenland temperature reconstructions. Marine proxies from the Atlantic indicate warmer than late Holocene year-round SSTs north of 30N, whereas SST changes were more variable south of this latitude . Transient LIG simulations with EMICs and low-resolution AOGCMs display peak NH summer warmth between 128 ka and 125 ka in response to orbital and WMGHG forcings. This warming is delayed when NH ice sheets are allowed to evolve . Time-slice climate simulations run by 13 modelling groups with a hierarchy of climate models forced with orbital and WMGHG changes for 128 to 125 ka  simulate the reconstructed pattern of NH annual warming . Positive feedbacks with the cryosphere  provide the memory that allows simulated NH high-latitude warming, annually as well as seasonally, in response to the seasonal orbital forcing . The 407	0

response to orbital forcing and WMGHG concentration changes, time slice simulations for 128 to 125 ka exhibit global mean annual surface temperature changes of 0.0C  0.5C as compared to pre-industrial. Data and models suggest a land-ocean contrast in the responses to the LIG forcing . Peak global annual SST warming is estimated from data to be 0.7C  0.6C  . Models give more confidence to the lower bound. The ensemble of climate model simulations gives a large range of global annual land temperature change relative to pre-industrial, -0.4C to 1.7C, when sampled at the data locations and cooler than when averaged for all model land areas, pointing to difficulties in estimating global mean annual surface temperature with current spatial data coverage .	0
5.3.5.1 Recent Warming in the Context of New Reconstructions New paleoclimate reconstruction efforts since AR4  have provided further insights into the characteristics of the Medieval Climate Anomaly  and the Little Ice Age . The timing and spatial structure of the MCA and LIA are complex , with different reconstructions exhibiting warm and cold conditions at different times for different regions and seasons. The median of the NH temperature reconstructions  indicates mostly warm conditions from about 950 to about 1250 and colder conditions from about 1450 to about 1850; these time intervals are chosen here to represent the MCA and the LIA, respectively.	0

reconstructions while making them more susceptible to errors in individual proxy records. The published uncertainty ranges do not include all sources of error , and some proxy records and uncertainty estimates do not fully represent variations on time scales as short as the 30 years considered in Table 5.4. Considering these caveats, there is medium confidence that the last 30 years were likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years. Increasing numbers of proxy records and regional reconstructions are being developed for the SH , but few reconstructions of SH or global mean temperatures have been published . The SH and global reconstructions with published uncertainty estimates indicate that each 30- or 50-year interval during the last four centuries was very likely colder than the warmest 30- or 50-year interval after 1900 . However, there is only limited proxy evidence and therefore low confidence that the recent warming has exceeded the range of reconstructed temperatures for the SH and global scales.	0
5.3.5.2 Reconstruction Methods, Limitations and Uncertainties Reconstructing NH, SH or global-mean temperature variations over the last 2000 years remains a challenge due to limitations of spatial sampling, uncertainties in individual proxy records and challenges associated with the statistical methods used to calibrate and integrate multi-proxy information . Since AR4, new assessments of the statistical methods used to reconstruct either global/hemispheric temperature averages or spatial fields of past temperature anomalies have been published. The former include approaches for simple compositing and scaling of local or regional proxy records into global and hemispheric averages using uniform or proxy-dependent weighting . The latter correspond to improvements in climate field reconstruction methods  that apply temporal and spatial relationships between instrumental and proxy records to the pre-instrumental period. New developments for both reconstruction approaches include implementations of Bayesian inference . In particular, Bayesian hierarchical models enable a more explicit representation of the underlying processes that relate proxy  records to climate, allowing a more systematic treatment of the multiple uncertainties that affect the climate reconstruction process. This is done by specifying simple parametric forms for the proxy-temperature relationships that are then used to estimate a probability distribution of the reconstructed temperature evolution that is compatible with the available data . An improved understanding of potential uncertainties and biases associated with reconstruction methods has been achieved, particularly by using millennial GCM simulations as a surrogate reality in which pseudo-proxy records are created and reconstruction methods are replicated and tested . A key finding is that the methods used for many published reconstructions can underestimate the amplitude of the low-frequency variability . The magnitude of this amplitude attenuation in real-world reconstructions is uncertain, but for affected methods the	0
problem will be larger:  for cases with weaker correlation between instrumental temperatures and proxies ;  if errors in the proxy data are not incorporated correctly ; or  if the data are detrended in the calibration phase . The 20th-century trends in proxies may contain relevant temperature information  but calibration with detrended or undetrended data has been an issue of debate  because trends in proxy records can be induced by other  climate and non-climatic influences . Recent developments mitigate the loss of low-frequency variance in global and hemispheric reconstructions by increasing the correlation between proxies and temperature through temporal smoothing  or by correctly attributing part or all of the temperature-proxy differences to imperfect proxy data . Pseudoproxy experiments have shown that the latter approach used with a site-by-site calibration  can also avoid attenuation of low-frequency variability, though it is debated whether it might instead inflate the variability and thus constitute an upper bound for low-frequency variability . Even those field reconstruction methods that do not attenuate the low-frequency variability of global or hemispheric means may still suffer from attenuation and other errors at regional scales . The fundamental limitations for deriving past temperature variability at global/hemispheric scales are the relatively short instrumental period and the number, temporal and geographical distribution, reliability and climate signal of proxy records . The database of high-resolution proxies has been expanded since AR4 , but data are still sparse in the tropics, SH and over the oceans . Integration of low-resolution records  with high-resolution tree-ring, ice core and coral records in global/hemispheric reconstructions is still challenging. Dating uncertainty, limited replication and the possibility of temporal lags in low-resolution records  make regression-based calibration particularly difficult  and can be potentially best addressed in the future with Bayesian hierarchical models . The short instrumental period and the paucity of proxy data in specific regions may preclude obtaining accurate estimates of the covariance of temperature and proxy records , impacting the selection and weighting of proxy records in global/hemispheric reconstructions  and resulting in regional errors in climate field reconstructions . Two further sources of uncertainty have been only partially considered in the published literature. First, some studies have used multiple statistical models  or generated ensembles of reconstructions by sampling parameter space , but this type of structural and parameter uncertainty needs further examination . Second, proxy-temperature relationships may change over time due to the effect of other climate 411	0
and non-climate influences on a proxy, a prominent example being the divergence between some tree-ring width and density chronologies and instrumental temperature trends during the last decades of the 20th century . In cases that do show divergence, a number of factors may be responsible, such as direct temperature or drought stress on trees, delayed snowmelt, changes in seasonality and reductions in solar radiation . However, this phenomenon does not affect all tree-ring records  and in some cases where divergence is apparent it may arise from the use of inappropriate statistical standardization of the data  and not from a genuine change in the proxy-temperature relationship. For the European Alps and Siberia, Buntgen et al.,  and Esper et al.  demonstrate that divergence can be avoided by careful selection of sites and standardization methods together with large sample replication. Limitations in proxy data and reconstruction methods suggest that published uncertainties will underestimate the full range of uncertainties of large-scale temperature reconstructions . While this has fostered debate about the extent to which proxy-based reconstructions provide useful climate information , it is well established that temperature and external forcing signals are detectable in proxy reconstructions . Recently, model experiments assuming a nonlinear sensitivity of tree-rings to climate  have been used to suggest that the tree-ring response to volcanic cooling may be attenuated and lagged. Tree-ring data and additional tree-growth model assessments  have challenged this interpretation and analyses of instrumental data suggest hemispheric temperature reconstructions agree well with the degree of volcanic cooling during early 19th-century volcanic events . These lines of evidence leave the representation of volcanic events in tree-ring records and associated hemispheric scale temperature reconstructions as an emerging area of investigation.	0
The number of GCM simulations of the last millennium has increased since AR4 . The simulations have used different estimates of natural and anthropogenic forcings . In particular, the PMIP3/CMIP5 simulations are driven by smaller long-term changes in TSI : TSI increases by 0.10% from the Late Maunder Minimum  to the late 20th century , while most previous simulations use increases between 0.23% and 0.29% . Simulated NH temperatures during the last millennium lie mostly within the uncertainties of the available reconstructions . This agreement between GCM simulations and reconstructions provides neither strong constraints on forcings nor on model sensitivities because internal variability and uncertainties in the forcings and reconstructions are considerable factors. Data have also been assimilated into climate models  by either nudging simulations to follow local or regional proxy-based reconstructions  or by 412	0
selecting simulations from decade-by-decade ensembles to obtain the closest match to reconstructed climate patterns . The resulting simulations provide insight into the relative roles of internal variability and external forcing , and processes that may account for the spatial distribution of past climate anomalies . Figure 5.8b-d provides additional tests of model-data agreement by compositing the temperature response to a number of distinct forcing events. The models simulate a significant NH cooling in response to volcanic events  that lasts 3 to 5 years, overlapping with the signal inferred from reconstructions with annual resolution . CMIP5 simulations tend to overestimate cooling following the major 1809 and 1815 eruptions relative to early instrumental data . Such differences could arise from uncertainties in volcanic forcing  and its implementation in climate models  or from errors in the reconstructions . Since many reconstructions do not have annual resolution, similar composites  are formed to show the response to changes in multi-decadal volcanic forcings . Both the simulated and reconstructed responses are significant and comparable in magnitude, although simulations show a faster recovery  than reconstructions. Solar forcing estimated over the last millennium shows weaker variations than volcanic forcing , even at multi-decadal time scales. Compositing the response to multi-decadal fluctuations in solar irradiance shows cooling in simulations and reconstructions of NH temperature between 0.0C and 0.15C. In both cases, the cooling may be partly a response to concurrent variations in volcanic forcing . Temperature differences between the warmest and coolest centennial or multi-centennial periods provide an additional comparison of the amplitude of NH temperature variations in the reconstructions and simulations: between 950 and 1250  and 1450- 1850  and between the LIA and the 20th century . Despite similar multi-model and multi-reconstruction means for the warming from the LIA to the present, the range of individual results is very wide  and there is no clear difference between runs with weaker or stronger solar forcing . The difference between the MCA and LIA temperatures, however, has a smaller range for the model simulations than the reconstructions, and the simulations  lie within the lower half of the reconstructed range of temperature changes . Recent studies have assessed the consistency of model simulations and temperature reconstructions at the hemispheric scale. Hind and Moberg  found closer data-model agreement for simulations with 0.1% TSI increase than 0.24% TSI increase, but the result is sensitive to the reconstruction uncertainty and the climate sensitivity of the model. Simulations with an EMIC using a much stronger solar forcing  appear to be incompatible with most temperature reconstructions .	0

The spatial distributions of simulated and reconstructed  temperature changes between the MCA, LIA and 20th century are shown in Figure 5.9. Simulated changes tend to be larger, particularly with stronger TSI forcing, over the continents and ice/snow-covered regions, showing polar amplification . The largest simulated and reconstructed changes are between the LIA and present, with reconstructions  indicating widespread warming except for the cooling south of Greenland. Models also simulate overall warming between the MCA and present , whereas the reconstructions indicate significant regional cooling (in the North Atlantic, southeastern North America, and the mid-latitudes 414	0
of the Pacific Ocean). This is not surprising because greater regional variability is expected in the reconstructions compared with the mean of multiple model simulations, though reconstructed changes for such areas with few or no proxy data  should also be interpreted with caution . The reconstructed temperature differences between MCA and LIA  indicate higher medieval temperatures over the NH continents in agreement with simulations . The reconstructed MCA warming is higher than in the simulations, even for stronger TSI changes and individual simulations . Simulations with proxy assimilation show that this pattern of change is compatible with a direct response	0
to a relatively weak solar forcing and internal variability patterns similar to a positive Northern Annular Mode  phase and northward shifts of the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream currents . For the tropical regions, an enhanced zonal SST gradient produced by either a warmer Indian Ocean  or a cooler eastern Pacific   could explain the reconstructed MCA patterns . However, the enhanced gradients are not reproduced by model simulations  and are not robust when considering the reconstruction uncertainties and the limited proxy records in these tropical ocean regions  . This precludes an assessment of the role of external forcing and/or internal variability in these reconstructed patterns.	0
During the MPWP, climate conditions in the equatorial Pacific were characterized by weaker zonal  and cross-equatorial  SST gradients, consistent with the absence of an eastern equatorial cold tongue. This state still supported interannual variability, according to proxy records . These results together with recent GCM experiments  indicate  that interannual ENSO variability existed, at least sporadically, during the warm background state of the Pliocene . LGM GCM simulations display wide ranges in the behaviour of ENSO and the eastern equatorial Pacific annual cycle of SST with little consistency  . Currently ENSO variance reconstructions for the LGM are too uncertain to help constrain the simulated responses of the annual cycle and ENSO to LGM boundary conditions. GCMs show that a reduced AMOC very likely induces intensification of ENSO amplitude and for the majority of climate models also a reduction of the amplitude of the SST annual cycle in the eastern equatorial Pacific  . About 75% of the PMIP2 and PMIP3/CMIP5 mid-Holocene simulations exhibit a weakening of interannual SST amplitude in the eastern equatorial Pacific relative to pre-industrial conditions. More than 87% of these simulations also show a concomitant substantial weakening in the amplitude of the annual cycle of eastern equatorial Pacific SST. Model results are consistent with a reduction of total variance of d18O variations of individual foraminifera in the eastern equatorial Pacific, indicative of an orbital effect on eastern equatorial Pacific SST variance . In contrast to these findings, a recent proxy study	0
using sub-annually resolved d18O from central equatorial Pacific coral segments  reveals no evidence for orbitally-induced changes in interannual ENSO amplitude throughout the last 7 ka , which is consistent with the weak reduction in mid-Holocene ENSO amplitude of only ~10% simulated by the majority of climate models , but contrasts with reconstructions reported in AR4 that showed a reduction in ENSO variance during the first half of the Holocene. The same study revealed an ENSO system that experienced very large internal variance changes on decadal and centennial time scales. This latter finding is also confirmed by the analysis of about 2000 years of annually varved lake sediments  in the ENSO-teleconnected region of equatorial East Africa. Furthermore, Cobb et al.  identify the late 20th century as a period of anomalously high, although not unprecedented, ENSO variability relative to the average reconstructed variance over the last 7000 years. Reconstructions of ENSO for the last millennium also document multi-decadal-to-centennial variations in the amplitude of reconstructed interannual eastern equatorial Pacific SST anomalies . Statistical efforts to determine ENSO variance changes in different annually resolved ENSO proxies  and from documentary sources  reveal  extended periods of low ENSO activity during parts of the LIA compared to the 20th century. Direct TSI effects on reconstructed multi-decadal ENSO variance changes cannot be identified . According to reconstructions of volcanic events  and some ENSO proxies, a slightly increased probability exists  for the occurrence of El Nino events 1 to 2 years after major volcanic eruptions . This response is not captured robustly by GCMs .	0
Robust evidence from LGM simulations indicates a weakening of the NAM variability, connected with stronger planetary wave activity . A significant but model-dependent distortion of the simulated LGM NAO pattern may result from the strong topographic ice sheet forcing . A multimodel analysis of NAO behaviour in mid-Holocene GCM simulations  reveals an NAO structure, similar to its pre-industrial state, but a tendency for more positive NAO values during the early Holocene , with no consistent change in its interannual variability. Robust proxy evidence to test these model-based results has not yet been established. A new 5200-year-long lake sediment record from southwestern Greenland  suggests that around 4500 and 650 years ago variability associated with the NAO changed from generally positive to variable, intermittently negative conditions. Since AR4, a few cold-season NAO reconstructions for the last centuries have been published. They are based on long instrumental pressure series , a combination of instrumental and ship log-book data  and two proxy records . Whereas these and earlier NAO reconstructions (Cook et al., 2002; 415	0

Luterbacher et al., 2002; Timm et al., 2004; Pinto and Raible, 2012) differ in several aspects, and taking into consideration associated reconstruction uncertainties, they demonstrate with high confidence that the strong positive NAO phases of the early 20th century and the mid-1990s are not unusual in the context of the past half millennium. Trouet et al.  presented a winter NAO reconstruction that yielded a persistent positive phase during the MCA in contrast to higher frequency variability during the LIA. This is not consistent with the strong NAO imprint in Greenland ice core data  and recent results from transient model simulations that neither support such a persistent positive NAO during the MCA, nor a strong NAO phase shift during the LIA . A recent pseudo-proxy-based assessment of low-frequency NAO behaviour  infers weaknesses in the reconstruction method used by Trouet et al. . Last millennium GCM simulations reveal no significant response of the NAO to solar forcing , except for the GISS-ER coupled model which includes ozone photochemistry, extends into the middle atmosphere and exhibits changes in NAO that are weak during the MCA compared to the LIA . Changes in the SAM modulate the strength and position of the mean SH westerlies, and leave an important signature on SH present-day surface climate  past tree-ring growth (e.g., Urrutia et 416	0
al., 2011), wildfires  as well as on LGM climate . A first hemispheric-wide, tree-ring-based reconstruction of the austral summer SAM  indicates that the late 20th century positive trend may have been anomalous in the context of the last 600 years, thus supporting earlier South American proxy evidence for the last 400 years  and GCM . Hence, there is medium confidence that the positive trend in SAM since 1950 may be anomalous compared to the last 400 years. The AMO   has been reconstructed using marine  and terrestrial proxy records  from different locations. Correlations among different AMO reconstructions decrease rapidly prior to 1900 . An 8000-year long AMO reconstruction  shows no correlation with TSI changes, and is interpreted as internally generated ocean-atmosphere variability. However, GCM experiments  using solar and/ or volcanic forcing reconstructions indicate that external forcings may have played a role in driving or at least acting as pacemaker for AMO variations.	0
5.5.1.1 Northern Hemisphere Mid to High Latitudes New studies confirm the spatial patterns of SAT and SST distribution as summarised in AR4 . According to a recent compilation of proxy data, the global mean annual temperatures around 8 to 6 ka were about 0.7C higher, and extratropical NH temperatures were about 1C higher than for pre-industrial conditions . Spatial variability in the temperature anomalies and the timing of the thermal maximum implicate atmospheric or oceanic dynamical feedbacks including effects from remaining ice sheets . The peak early-to-mid-Holocene North Atlantic and sub-Arctic SST anomalies are reconstructed and simulated to primarily occur in summer and in the stratified uppermost surface-ocean layer . Terrestrial MH  summer-season temperatures were higher than modern in the mid-to-high latitudes of the NH, consistent with minimum glacier extents  and PMIP2 and PMIP3/CMIP5 simulated responses to orbital forcing  . There is also robust evidence for warmer MH winters compared to the late 20th century  , but the simulated high latitude winter warming is model dependent and is sensitive to ocean and sea-ice changes . Overall, models underestimate the reduction in the latitudinal gradient of European winter temperatures during the MH . There is a general, gradual NH cooling after ~5 ka, linked to orbital forcing, and increased amplitude of millennial-scale variability . Since AR4, regional temperature reconstructions have been produced for the last 2 kyr . A recent multi-proxy 2000-year Arctic temperature reconstruction shows that temperatures during the first centuries were comparable or even higher than during the 20th century . During the MCA, portions of the Arctic and sub-Arctic experienced periods warmer than any subsequent period, except for the most recent 50 years  . Tingley and Huybers  provided a statistical analysis of northern high-latitude temperature reconstructions back to 1400 and found that recent extreme hot summers are unprecedented over this time span. Marine proxy records indicate anomalously high SSTs north of Iceland and the Norwegian Sea from 900 to 1300, followed by a generally colder period that ended in the early 20th century. Modern SSTs in this region may still be lower than the warmest intervals of the 900- 1300 period . Further north, in Fram Strait, modern SSTs from Atlantic Water appear warmer than those reconstructed from foraminifera for any prior period of the last 2000 years	0
. However, different results are obtained using dinocysts from the same sediment core  showing a cooling trend over the last 2000 years without a 20th century rise, and warmest intervals centered at years 100 and 600. Tree-ring data and lake sediment information from the North American treeline  suggest common variability between different records during the last centuries. An annually resolved, tree-ring based 800-year temperature reconstruction over temperate North America  and a 1500-year long pollen-based temperature estimate  show cool periods 500-700 and 1200-1900 as well as a warm period between 750 and 1100. The generally colder conditions until 1900 are in broad agreement with other pollen, tree-ring and lake-sediment evidence from northwest Canada, the Canadian Rockies and Colorado . It is very likely that the most recent decades have been, on average, the warmest across mid-latitude western and temperate North America over at least 500 years . New warm-season temperature reconstructions  covering the past 2 millennia show that warm European summer conditions were prevalent during 1st century, followed by cooler conditions from the 4th to the 7th century. Persistent warm conditions also occurred during the 8th-11th centuries, peaking throughout Europe during the 10th century. Prominent periods with cold summers occurred in the mid-15th and early 19th centuries. There is high confidence that northern Fennoscandia from 900 to 1100 was as warm as the mid-to-late 20th century . The evidence also suggests warm conditions during the 1st century, but comparison with recent temperatures is restricted because long-term temperature trends from tree-ring data are uncertain . In the European Alps region, tree-ring based summer temperature reconstructions  show higher temperatures in the last decades than during any time in the MCA, while reconstructions based on lake sediments  show as high, or slightly higher temperatures during parts of the MCA compared to most recent decades. The longest summer temperature reconstructions from parts of the Alps show several intervals during Roman and earlier times as warm  than most of the 20th century . Since AR4, new temperature reconstructions have also been generated for Asia. A tree-ring based summer temperature reconstruction for temperate East Asia back to 800 indicates warm conditions during the period 850-1050, followed by cooler conditions during 1350-1880 and a subsequent 20th century warming . Tree-ring reconstructions from the western Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau, Tianshan Mountains and western High Asia depict warm conditions from the 10th to the 15th centuries, lower temperature afterwards and a 20th century warming . 417	0

Taking associated uncertainties into consideration, 20th century temperatures in those regions were likely not higher than during the first part of the last millennium. In different regions of China, temperatures appear higher during recent decades than during earlier centuries, although with large uncertainties . In northeast China, an alkenone-based reconstruction indicates that the growing season temperature during the periods 480-860, 1260-1300, 1510-1570 and 1800-1900 was about 1C lower compared with the 20th century . These reconstructed NH regional temperature evolutions appear consistent with last millennium GCM simulations using a range of solar forcing estimates . There is high confidence that in the extratropical NH, both regionally and on a hemispheric basis, the surface warming of the 20th century reversed the long term cooling trend due to orbital forcing.	0
5.5.1.2 Tropics Marcott et al.  provide a compilation of tropical SST reconstructions, showing a gradual warming of about 0.5C until 5 ka and little change thereafter. Holocene tropical SST trends are regionally heterogeneous and variable in magnitude. Alkenone records from the eastern tropical Pacific, western tropical Atlantic, and the Indonesian archipelago document a warming trend of ~0.5C to 2C from the early Holocene to present , consistent with local insolation. In contrast, regional trends of planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca records are heterogeneous, and imply smaller magnitude SST changes . Foraminiferal Mg/Ca records in the Indo-Pacific warm-pool region show cooling trends with varying magnitudes . When comparing SST records from different paleoclimate proxies it is important to note that they can have different, and also regionally varying, seasonal biases .	0
strength of the westerlies . The Holocene land-surface temperature history in the SH is difficult to assess. Individual reconstructions generally track the trends registered by Antarctic ice core records with peak values at around 12 to 10 ka . Pollen-based records indicate positive MH temperature anomalies in southern South Africa that are not reproduced in the PMIP3/CMIP5 simulations . Indices for the position of Southern Ocean fronts and the strength and position of the westerlies diverge . For the mid-to-late-Holocene, climate models of different complexity consistently show a poleward shift and intensification of the SH westerlies in response to orbital forcing . However, the magnitude, spatial pattern and seasonal response vary significantly among the models. New high-resolution, climate reconstructions for the last millennium are based on tree-ring records from the subtropical and central Andes, northern and southern Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, New Zealand and Tasmania , ice cores, lake and marine sediments and documentary evidence from southern South America , terrestrial and shallow marine geological records from eastern Antarctica , ice cores from Antarctica , boreholes from western Antarctica  and coral records from the Indian and Pacific Oceans . There is medium confidence that southern South America  austral summer temperatures during 950-1350 were warmer than the 20th century. A 1000-year temperature reconstruction for land and ocean representing Australasia indicates a warm period during 1160-1370 though this reconstruction is based on only three records before 1430 . In Australasia, 1971-2000 temperatures were very likely higher than any other 30-year period over the last 580 years . Antarctica was likely warmer than 1971-2000 during the late 17th century, and during the period from approximately the mid-2nd century to 1250 . In conclusion, continental scale surface temperature reconstructions from 950 to 1250 show multi-decadal periods that were in some regions as warm as in the mid-20th century and in others as warm as in the late 20th century . These regional warm periods were not as synchronous across regions as the warming since the mid20th century .	0
in sediments . Indirect information on sea-ice conditions based on drift wood and beach erosion has also been compiled . In general, these sea-ice reconstructions parallel regional SST, yet they display spatial heterogeneity, and differences between the methods, making it difficult to provide quantitative estimates of past sea-ice extent. Summer sea-ice cover was reduced compared to late 20th century levels both in the Arctic Ocean and along East Greenland between 8 ka and 6.5 ka , a feature which is captured by some MH simulations . The response of this sea ice cover to summer insolation warming was shown to be central for explaining the reconstructed warmer winter temperatures over the adjacent land . During the last 6 kyr available records show a long-term trend of a more extensive Arctic sea ice cover driven by the orbital forcing , but punctuated by strong century-to-millennial scale variability. Consistent with Arctic temperature changes , sea ice proxies indicate relatively reduced sea-ice cover from 800 to 1200 followed by a subsequent increase during the LIA . Proxy reconstructions document the 20th-century ice loss trend, which is also observed in historical sea ice data sets with a decline since the late 19th century . There is medium confidence that the current ice loss was unprecedented and that current SSTs in the Arctic were anomalously high at least in the context of the last 1450 years . Fewer high-resolution records exist from the Southern Ocean. Data from the Indian Ocean sector document an increasing sea-ice trend during the Holocene, with a rather abrupt increase between 5 ka and 4 ka, consistent with regional temperatures  .	0
Due to the response time of glacier fronts, glacier length variations resolve only decadal- to centennial-scale climate variability. Since AR4 new and improved chronologies of glacier size variations were published . Studies of sediments from glacier-fed lakes and marine deposits have allowed new continuous reconstructions of glacier fluctuations . Reconstructions of the history of ice shelves and ice sheets/caps have also emerged . New data confirm a general increase of glacier extent in the NH and decrease in the SH during the Holocene , consistent with the local trends in summer insolation and temperatures. Some exceptions exist , where glaciers were most extensive in the early Holocene , potentially due to monsoon changes . Due to dating uncertainties, incompleteness and heterogeneity of most existing glacial chronologies, it is difficult to compare glacier variations between regions at centennial and shorter time scales . There are no definitive conclusions	0
regarding potential inter-hemispheric synchronicity of sub-millennial scale glacier fluctuations . Glacial chronologies for the last 2 kyr are better constrained . Multi-centennial glacier variability has been linked with variations in solar activity , volcanic forcing  and changes in North Atlantic circulation . Glacier response is more heterogeneous and complex during the MCA than the uniform global glacier recession observed at present . Glaciers were smaller during the MCA than in the early 21st Century in the western Antarctic Peninsula  and Southern Greenland . However, prominent advances occurred within the MCA in the Alps , Patagonia , New Zealand , East Greenland  and SE Tibet . Glaciers in northwestern North America were similar in size during the MCA compared to the peak during the LIA, probably driven by increased winter precipitation . There is high confidence that glaciers at times have been smaller than at the end of the 20th century in the Alps , Scandinavia , Altai in Central Asia , Baffin Island , Greenland , Spitsbergen , but the precise glacier extent in the previous warm periods of the Holocene is often difficult to assess. While early-to-mid-Holocene glacier minima can be attributed with high confidence to high summer insolation , the current glacier retreat, however, occurs within a context of orbital forcing that would be favourable for NH glacier growth. If retreats continue at current rates, most extratropical NH glaciers will shrink to their minimum extent, that existed between 8 ka and 6 ka  ; and ice shelves on the Antarctic peninsula will retreat to an extent unprecedented through Holocene .	0
This subsection focuses on internally and externally driven variability of monsoon systems during the last millennium. Abrupt monsoon changes associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich events  are further assessed in Section 5.7.1. Orbital-scale monsoon  changes are evaluated in Section 5.3.2.3. Hydrological proxy data characterizing the intensity of the East Asian monsoon  show decreased  hydrological activity during the LIA as compared to the MCA   . These shifts were accompanied by changes in the occurrence of megadroughts  in parts of the Asian monsoon region  . Lake sediment data from coastal eastern Africa document dry conditions in the late MCA, a wet LIA, and return toward dry conditions in the 18th or 421	0
early 19th century , qualitatively similar to the South American monsoon proxies in Figure 5.4i, whereas some inland and southern African lakes suggest dry spells during the LIA . Rainfall patterns associated with the Pacific ITCZ also shifted southward during the MCA/LIA transition in the central equatorial Pacific . Extended intervals of monsoon failures and dry spells have been reconstructed for the last few millennia for west Africa , east Africa , northern Africa , India and southeastern Asia  and Australia . On multi-decadal-to-centennial time scales, influences of North Atlantic SST variations have been demonstrated for the North and South African monsoon, and the Indian and East Asian summer monsoons , both using proxy reconstructions  and GCM simulations . These simulations suggest that solar and volcanic forcing  may exert only weak regional influences on monsoon systems . A five-member multi-model ensemble mean of PMIP3/CMIP5 simulations  exhibits decreased standardized monsoon rainfall accompanying periods of reduced solar forcing during the LIA in the East Asian monsoon regions . There is, however, a considerable inter-model spread in the simulated annual mean precipitation response to solar forcing with the multi-model mean, explaining on average only ~25  15%  of the variance of the individual model simulations. An assessment of the pre-instrumental response of monsoon systems to volcanic forcing using paleo-proxy data has revealed wetter conditions over southeast Asia in the year of a major volcanic eruption and drier conditions in central Asia , in contrast to GCM simulations .	0
Multiple lines of proxy evidence from tree rings, lake sediments, and speleothems indicate with high confidence that decadal or multi-decadal episodes of drought have been a prominent feature of North American Holocene hydroclimate . During the last millennium, western North America drought reconstructions based on tree ring information  show longer and more severe droughts than today, particularly during the MCA in the southwestern and central United States . The mid-14th century cooling coincides in southwestern North America with a shift towards overall wetter conditions . In the Pacific Northwest, contrasting results emerge from lake sediment records, indicating wetter conditions during the MCA , and treering data showing no substantial change . In Scandinavia, new tree-ring based reconstruc422	0
tions show a multi-centennial summer drought phase during Medieval times  , while lake sediment proxies from the same region suggest wetter winters . New tree-ring reconstructions from the southern-central  and southeastern British Isles  do not reveal multi-centennial drought during medieval times, but rather alternating multidecades of dry and wet periods. Wilson et al.  reconstructed drier conditions between ~1300 and the early 16th century. Buntgen et al.  identified exceptionally dry conditions in central Europe from 200 to 350 and between 400 and 600. Numerous tree-ring records from the eastern Mediterranean testify to the regular occurrence of droughts in the past few millennia . In northern Africa, Esper et al.  and Touchan et al.  show severe drought events through the last millennium, particularly prior to 1300, in the 1400s, between 1700 and 1900, and in the most recent instrumental data. Using multiple proxies from Chile, Boucher et al.  inferred wetter conditions during 1000-1250, followed by much drier period until 1400 and wetter conditions similar to present afterwards, while Ledru et al.  reconstructed a dry MCA-LIA transition until 1550. For the South American Altiplano Morales et al.  found periods of drier conditions in the 14th, 16th, and 18th centuries, as well as a modern drying trend. Reconstruction of past flooding from sedimentary, botanical and historical records  provides a means to compare recent large, rare floods, and to analyse links between flooding and climate variability. During the last few millennia, flood records reveal strong decadal to secular variability and non-stationarity in flood frequency and clustering of paleofloods, which varied among regions. In Europe, modern flood magnitudes are not unusual within the context of the last 1000 years . In Central Europe, the Elbe and the Oder/Odra Rivers show a decrease in the frequency of winter floods during the last 80 to 150 years compared to earlier centuries, while summer floods indicate no significant trend  . In the Alps, paleoflood records derived from lake sediments have shown a higher flood frequency during cool and/or wet phases , a feature also found in Central Europe  and the British Isles . In the western Mediterranean, winter floods were more frequent during relatively cool and wet climate conditions of the LIA , whereas autumn floods reflect multi-decadal variations . In China, extraordinary paleoflood events in the Yellow, Weihe and Qishuihe rivers, occurred synchronously with severe droughts and dust accumulations coinciding with a monsoonal shift, the most severe floods dated at 3.1 ka . In India, flood frequencies since 1950 are the largest for the last several hundred years for eight rivers, interpreted as a strengthening of the monsoon conditions after the LIA . In southwestern United States, increased frequency of high-magnitude paleofloods coincide with periods of cool, wet climate, whereas warm intervals including the MCA, corresponded with significant decreases in the number of large floods . In the Great Plains of North America, the frequency of large floods increased significantly around 850 with magnitudes	0

Depicted is the number of floods exceeding a particular discharge threshold or flood height over periods of 20 years .

roughly two to three times larger than those of the 1972 flood . South America large flooding in the Atacama and Peruvian desert streams originated in the highland Altiplano and were particularly intense during El Nino events . In the winter rainfall zone of southern Africa, the frequency of large floods decreased during warmer conditions  and increased during wetter, colder conditions . In summary, there is high confidence that past floods larger than recorded since the 20th century have occurred during the past 500 years in northern and central Europe, western Mediterranean region, and eastern Asia. There is, however, medium confidence that in the Near East, India, central North America, modern large floods are comparable to or surpass historical floods in magnitude and/or frequency.	0
This section discusses evidence for global mean sea level  change from key periods. The MPWP  has been selected as a period of higher than present sea level , warmer temperature  and 350-450 ppm atmospheric CO2 concentration . Of the recent interglacial periods with evidence for higher than present sea level, the LIG has the best-preserved record . For testing glacio-isostatic adjustment  models, the principal characteristics of Termination I, including Meltwater Pulse-1A  is assessed. For the Holocene, the emphasis is on the last 6000 years when ice volumes stabilized near present-day values, providing the baseline for discussion of anthropogenic contributions.	0
Estimates of peak sea levels during the MPWP  based on a variety of geological records are consistent in suggesting higher-than-present sea levels, but they range widely , and are each subject to large uncertainties. For example, coastal records  are influenced by GIA, with magnitudes of the order of 5 m to 30 m for sites in the far and near fields of ice sheets, respectively , and global mantle dynamic processes  may contribute up to an additional 10 m. Consequently, both signals can be as large as the sea level estimate itself and current estimates of their amplitudes are uncertain. Benthic 18O records are better dated than many coastal records and provide a continuous time series, but the 18O signal reflects ice volume, temperature and regional hydrographic variability. During the mid-Pliocene warm interval, the 0.1 to 0.25 anomalies recorded in the LR04 benthic 18O stack  would translate into ~12 to 31 m higher than present GMSL, if they reflected only ice volume. Conversely, these anomalies could be explained entirely by warmer deep-water temperatures . Attempts to constrain the temperature component in benthic 18O records conclude higher than present GMSL during the MPWP with large uncertainties  .	0
The first appearance of ice-rafted debris across the entire North Atlantic indicates that continental-scale ice sheets in North America and Eurasia did not develop until about 2.7 Ma . This suggests that MPWP high sea levels were due to mass loss from the GIS, the WAIS and possibly the East Antarctic Ice sheet . Sedimentary record from the Ross Sea indicates that the WAIS and the marine margin of EAIS retreated periodically during obliquity-paced interglacial periods of MPWP . Reconstructed SSTs for the ice free seasons in the Ross Sea range from 2C to 8C , with mean values >5C being, according to one ice sheet model, above the stability threshold for ice shelves and marine portions of the WAIS and EAIS . A synthesis of the geological evidence from the coastal regions of the Transantarctic Mountains  and an iceberg-rafted debris record offshore of Prydz Bay  also supports coastal thinning and retreat of the EAIS between about 5 to 2.7 Ma. In response to Pliocene climate, ice sheet models consistently produce near-complete deglaciation of GIS  and WAIS  and retreat of the marine margins of EAIS  , altogether corresponding to a GMSL rise of up to 14 m. In summary, there is high confidence that GMSL was above present, due to deglaciation of GIS, WAIS and areas of EAIS, and that sea level was not higher than 20 m above present during the interglacials of the MPWP.	0
Proxy indicators of sea level, including emergent shoreline deposits  and foraminiferal d18O records  are used to reconstruct LIG sea levels. Implicit in these reconstructions is that geophysical processes affecting the elevation of the sea level indicators  have been properly modelled and/or that the sea level component of the stable isotope signal has been properly isolated. Particularly important issues with regard to the LIG are  the ongoing debate on its initiation and duration , due to coral geochronology issues;  the magnitude of its maximum rise; and  sea level variability within the interval. Foraminiferal d18O records can constrain  and possibly . Emergent shorelines on tectonically active coasts can constrain  and  and possibly  if vertical tectonic rates are independently known. Shorelines on tectonically stable coasts can constrain all three issues. Here evidence from emergent shorelines that can be dated directly is emphasized.	0
level indicators . Their analysis accounted for GIA effects as well as uncertainties in geochronology, the interpretation of sea level indicators, and regional tectonic uplift and subsidence. They concluded that GMSL was very likely +6.6 m and likely +8.0 m relative to present, and that it is unlikely to have exceeded +9.4 m, although some of the most rapid and sustained rates of change occur in the early period when GMSL was still below present . Dutton and Lambeck  used data from two tectonically stable farfield areas , Australia and the Seychelles islands. At these sites, in contrast to sites near the former ice margins, the isostatic signals are less sensitive to the choice of parameters defining the Earth rheology and the glacial ice sheets . On the west coast of Australia, the highest LIG reef elevations are at +3.5 m and the inferred paleo-sea level, allowing for possible reef erosion, is about +5.5 m relative to present. In the Seychelles, LIG coral reefs occur from 0 m to 6 m, but also possibly as high as ~9 m . Ten of the eleven LIG coral samples from the Seychelles used in Dutton and Lambeck  have reef elevation estimates ranging from +2.1 to +4 m relative to present; whereas a single LIG coral sample has a reef elevation estimate of +6 m. Additional results are needed to support an estimate of a maximum LIG sea level at the Seychelles of + 9 m relative to present. In conclusion, there is very high confidence that the maximum GMSL during the LIG was, for several thousand years, at least 5 m higher than present but that GMSL at this time did not exceed 10 m . The best estimate from the two available studies is 6 m higher than present.	0
Two episodes of reef building during the LIG have been reported on the Yucatan coast  and in the Bahamas . Blanchon et al.  provide evidence of Yucatan reef growth early in the LIG at a relative sea level of +3 m, followed by a later episode at +6 m. Thompson et al.  inferred a +4 m relative sea level at ~123 ka, followed by a fall to near present, and finally a rise to +6 m at ~119 ka. This yields a rate of sea level change in the Bahamas of ~2.6 m kyr-1, although the higher estimate at the end of the interval may reflect GIA effects that result in a rise in relative sea level at these locations . LIG sea level rise rates of between 1.1 and 2.6 m per century have been estimated based on a foraminiferal d18O record from the Red Sea . However, the original Red-Sea chronology was based on a short LIG duration of 124 to 119 ka, after Thompson and Goldstein . The longer LIG duration of 130 to 116 ka indicated by the coral data  reduces these rates to 0.4 to 426	0
0.9 m per century, and a revised chronology of the Red Sea sea level record adjusted to ages from Soreq Cave yields estimates of sea level rise rates of up to 0.7 m per century when sea level was above present level during the LIG . In their probabilistic assessment of LIG sea level, Kopp et al.  concluded that it was extremely likely that there were at least two peaks in sea level during the LIG. They further concluded that during the interval following the initial peak at ~126 ka  it is likely that there was a period in which GMSL rose at an average rate exceeding 3 m kyr-1, but unlikely that this rate exceeded 7 m kyr-1. In summary, there is evidence for two intra-LIG sea level peaks  during which sea level varied by up to 4 m . The millennial-scale rate of sea level rise during these periods exceeded 2 m kyr-1 .	0
5.6.2.3 Implications for Ice Sheet Loss During the Last Interglacial The principal sources for the additional LIG meltwater are the GIS, WAIS and the low elevation, marine-based margins of the EAIS. An upper limit for the contributions from mountain glaciers is ~0.42  0.11 m if all present-day mountain glaciers melted . The estimated LIG ocean thermal expansion contribution is 0.4  0.3 m . Sedimentological evidence indicates that southern Greenland was not ice-free during the LIG . Since AR4, the evidence for LIG ice layers in Greenland ice cores, which was ambiguous from Dye 3 and unequivocal from Summit and NGRIP ice cores , has been strengthened. Data from the new NEEM ice core  point to an unequivocal existence of ice throughout the LIG with elevations differing a few hundred meter from present, possibly decreasing in elevation by ~ 400 m  350 m between 128 and 122 ka BP. GIS simulations give an average contribution of ~2.3 m to LIG GMSL . Each model result has been selected from a series of runs within a range of parameter uncertainties that yield predictions consistent with the occurrence of ice at NEEM and the elevation of that ice reconstructed from the ice core record. In summary, the GIS simulations that are consistent with elevation changes from the ice core analysis show limited ice retreat during this period such that this ice sheet very likely contributed between 1.4 and 4.3 m sea level equivalent, implying with medium confidence a contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet. One model of WAIS glacial-interglacial variability shows very little difference in ice volumes between the LIG and present  , when the surface climate and ocean melt term were parameterised using the global benthic 18O record for the last 5 Ma. Direct geological evidence of fluctuations in the extent of WAIS margin during the LIG is equivocal due to inadequate age control on two sediment cores which imply that open-water conditions existed in the southeastern sector of the Ross Ice Shelf at some time in the last 1 Ma (Scherer et al., 1998; McKay et al., 2011; Vaughan et al.,	0

2011) and in the vicinity of the northwestern Ross Ice Shelf within the last 250,000 years during MIS 7 or LIG . Ackert et al.  dated glacial erratics and moraines across the Ohio Mountain Range of the Transantarctic Mountains and concluded that the ice elevations were similar during the LIG and today, but such results cannot be extrapolated beyond this region. East Antarctic ice core LIG data may reflect the impact of a reduced WAIS due to climatic effects  but not through isostatic effects . Modelling and ice core data suggest EAIS may have retreated in the Wilkes Basin .	0
In summary, no reliable quantification of the contribution of the Antarctic ice volume to LIG sea level is currently possible. The only available transient ice sheet model simulation  does not have realistic boundary conditions, not enough is known about the subsurface temperatures and there are few direct observational constraints on the location of ice margins during this period. If the above inference of the contribution to GMSL from the GIS  is correct, the full GMSL change  implies significantly less LIG ice in Antarctica than today, but as yet this cannot be supported by the observational and model evidence.	0
et al.  from a new Tahiti coral record. At this location sea level rose between 14 and 18 m at a rate approaching 5 m per century. The source of MWP-1A continues to be widely debated with most attention being on scenarios in which the Antarctic ice sheet contributed either significantly  or very little . Evidence of rapid WAIS retreat at around the time of MWP-1A is also indicated by analysis of marine sediment cores . If the Antarctic ice sheet was the major contributor to MWP-1A then it must have contained at least 7*106 km3 more ice than at present , which is about twice the difference in Antarctic ice volume between the LGM and present found by Whitehouse et al. . Because of the Earth-ocean  response to rapid changes in ice volume, the amplitude of the associated sea level change is spatially variable  and can provide insight into the source region. Based on the comparison of the new Tahiti record with records from Barbados  and the Sunda Shelf , Deschamps et al.  conclude that a significant meltwater contribution to GMSL, of at least 7 m, originated from Antarctica. From ice sheet modelling, Gregoire et al.  argued that the separation of the North American Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets may in part be the cause of MWP-1A, contributing ~9 m in 500 years. Another ice sheet modelling study Carlson et al.  suggests a contribution of 6 to 8 m in 500 years from the Laurentide at the onset of the Bolling warming over North America. These studies indicate that there are no glaciological impediments to a major North American contribution to MWP-1A. In contrast, there are as yet no modelling results that show a rapid retreat or partial collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet at that time.	0
Since AR4, high-resolution sea level records from different localities suggest further periods of rapid ice-mass loss. For example, records from Singapore indicate a rise of ~14 m from ~9.5 to 8.0 ka followed by a short interval of a smaller rise centred on about 7.2 ka  and records from the US Atlantic  and North Sea coasts  suggest a rise at around ~9.0-7.5 ka that is possibly punctuated by one or two short intervals of higher rates. These and similar rapid events have to be interpreted against a background of rapid rise that is spatially variable because of the residual isostatic response to the last deglaciation . Different explanations of these short-du-	0

The rate of change occurring late in the 19th century are seen in all high resolution salt-marsh records--e.g., in New Zealand   and in Spain  --that extend into modern time and is consistent with Roman archaeological evidence .

The Spanish record  from estuarine sedimentary deposits is for two nearby localities; Bilboa  and Urdaibai  . The two global records  are estimates of change in global mean sea level from  the instrumental record  that overlaps the salt-marsh records, and  from a range of geological and archaeological indicators from different localities around the world , with the contributing records corrected individually for the isostatic effects at each location.	0
FAQ 5.2 | How Unusual is the Current Sea Level Rate of Change? The rate of mean global sea level change--averaging 1.7  0.2 mm yr-1 for the entire 20th century and between 2.8 and 3.6 mm yr-1 since 1993 --is unusual in the context of centennial-scale variations of the last two millennia. However, much more rapid rates of sea level change occurred during past periods of rapid ice sheet disintegration, such as transitions between glacial and interglacial periods. Exceptional tectonic effects can also drive very rapid local sea level changes, with local rates exceeding the current global rates of change. `Sea level' is commonly thought of as the point where the ocean meets the land. Earth scientists define sea level as a measure of the position of the sea surface relative to the land, both of which may be moving relative to the center of the Earth. A measure of sea level therefore reflects a combination of geophysical and climate factors. Geophysical factors affecting sea level include land subsidence or uplift and glacial isostatic adjustments--the earth-ocean system's response to changes in mass distribution on the Earth, specifically ocean water and land ice. Climate influences include variations in ocean temperatures, which cause sea water to expand or contract, changes in the volume of glaciers and ice sheets, and shifts in ocean currents. Local and regional changes in these climate and geophysical factors produce significant deviations from the global estimate of the mean rate of sea level change. For example, local sea level is falling at a rate approaching 10 mm yr-1 along the northern Swedish coast , due to ongoing uplift caused by continental ice that melted after the last glacial period. In contrast, local sea level rose at a rate of ~20 mm yr-1 from 1960 to 2005 south of Bangkok, mainly in response to subsidence due to ground water extraction. For the past ~150 years, sea level change has been recorded at tide gauge stations, and for the past ~20 years, with satellite altimeters. Results of these two data sets are consistent for the overlapping period. The globally averaged rate of sea level rise of ~1.7  0.2 mm yr-1 over the 20th century--and about twice that over the past two decades-- may seem small compared with observations of wave and tidal oscillations around the globe that can be orders of magnitude larger. However, if these rates persist over long time intervals, the magnitude carries important consequences for heavily populated, low-lying coastal regions, where even a small increase in sea level can inundate large land areas. Prior to the instrumental period, local rates of sea level change are estimated from indirect measures recorded in sedimentary, fossil and archaeological archives. These proxy records are spatially limited and reflect both local and global conditions. Reconstruction of a global signal is strengthened, though, when individual proxy records from widely different environmental settings converge on a common signal. It is important to note that geologic archives--particularly those before about 20,000 years ago--most commonly only capture millennial-scale changes in sea level. Estimates of century-scale rates of sea level change are therefore based on millennial-scale information, but it must be recognised that such data do not necessarily preclude more rapid rates of century-scale changes in sea level.	0
Sea level reconstructions for the last two millennia offer an opportunity to use proxy records to overlap with, and extend beyond, the instrumental period. A recent example comes from salt-marsh deposits on the Atlantic Coast of the United States, combined with sea level reconstructions based on tide-gauge data and model predictions, to document an average rate of sea level change since the late 19th century of 2.1  0.2 mm yr-1. This century-long rise exceeds any other century-scale change rate in the entire 2000-year record for this same section of coast. On longer time scales, much larger rates and amplitudes of sea level changes have sometimes been encountered. Glacial-interglacial climate cycles over the past 500,000 years resulted in global sea level changes of up to about 120 to 140 m. Much of this sea level change occurred in 10,000 to 15,000 years, during the transition from a full glacial period to an interglacial period, at average rates of 10 to 15 mm yr-1. These high rates are only sustainable when the Earth is emerging from periods of extreme glaciation, when large ice sheets contact the oceans. For example, during the transition from the last glacial maximum  to the present interglacial , fossil coral reef deposits indicate that global sea level rose abruptly by 14 to 18 m in less than 500 years. This event is known as Meltwater Pulse 1A, in which the rate of sea level rise reached more than 40 mm yr-1. These examples from longer time scales indicate rates of sea level change greater than observed today, but it should be remembered that they all occurred in special circumstances: at times of transition from full glacial to interglacial condition; at locations where the long-term after-effects of these transitions are still occurring; at locations of 	0

. Elevation histories derived from central Greenland ice core data  have presented evidence for thinning from 8 ka to 6 ka but no integrated observation-based estimate for the total ice sheet is available. Contributions from mountain glaciers for this interval are unknown. Resolving decimeter-scale sea level fluctuations is critical for understanding the causes of sea level change during the last few millennia. Three types of proxies have this capability: salt-marsh plants and microfauna  that form distinctive elevation zones reflecting variations in tolerances to the frequency and duration of tidal inundation ; coral microatolls found in intertidal environments close to lowest spring tides	0
; and coastal archaeological features constructed with direct  or indirect  relationships to sea level . Of these, the salt-marsh records are particularly important because they have been validated against regional tide-gauge records and because they can provide near-continuous records. The most robust signal captured in the salt-marsh proxy sea level records from both the NH and SH is an increase in rate, late in the 19th or in the early 20th century , that marks a transition from relatively low rates of change during the late Holocene  to modern rates  . Variability in both the magnitude and the timing  of 431	0
this acceleration has been reported , but Gehrels and Woodworth  have concluded that these mismatches can be reconciled within the observational uncertainties. Combined with the instrumental evidence  and with inferences drawn from archaeological evidence from 2000 years ago , rates of sea level rise exceeded the late Holocene background rate after about 1900  . Regionally, as along the US Atlantic coast and Gulf of Mexico coast, the salt-marsh records reveal some consistency in multi-decadal and centennial time scales deviations from the linear trends expected from the GIA signal  and  in Figure 5.17)  but they have not yet been identified as truly global phenomena. For the past 5 millennia the most complete sea level record from a single location consists of microatoll evidence from Kiritimati   that reveals with medium confidence that amplitudes of any fluctuations in GMSL during this interval did not exceed approximately 25 cm on time scales of a few hundred years. Proxy data from other localities with quasi-continuous records for parts of this pre-industrial period, likewise, do not identify significant global oscillations on centennial time scales .	0
Many paleoclimate archives document climate changes that happened at rates considerably exceeding the average rate of change for longerterm averaging periods prior and after this change . A variety of mechanisms have been suggested to explain the emergence of such abrupt climate changes . Most of them invoke the existence of nonlinearities or, more specifically, thresholds in the underlying dynamics of one or more Earth-system components. Both internal dynamics and external forcings can generate abrupt changes in the climate state. Documentation of abrupt climate changes in the past using multiple sources of proxy evidence can provide important benchmarks to test instability mechanisms in climate models. This assessment of abrupt climate change on time scales of 10 to 100 years focuses on Dansgaard-Oeschger  events and iceberg/meltwater discharges during Heinrich events, especially the advances since AR4 in reconstructing and understanding their global impacts and in extending the record of millennial-scale variability to about 800 ka. Twenty-five abrupt DO events  and several centennial-scale events  occurred during the last glacial cycle . DO events in Greenland were marked by an abrupt transition  from a cold phase, referred to as Greenland Stadial  into a warm phase, known as Greenland Interstadial . Subsequently but within a GI, a gradual cooling preceded a rapid jump to GS that lasted for centuries up to millennia. Thermal gas-fractionation methods  suggest that for certain DO events Greenland temperatures increased by up to 16C  2.5C  within several decades. Such transitions were also 432	0
accompanied by abrupt shifts in dust and deuterium excess, indicative of reorganizations in atmospheric circulation . Reconstructions from the subtropical Atlantic and Mediterranean reveal concomitant SST changes attaining values up to 5C . In spite of the visible presence of DO events in many paleoclimate records from both hemispheres, the underlying mechanisms still remain unresolved and range from internally generated atmosphere-ocean- ice sheet events , to solar-forced variability . However, given the lack of observational evidence for a direct linear modulation of solar irradiance on DO time scales, , solar forcing is an improbable candidate to generate DO events. There is robust evidence from multiple lines of paleoceanographic information and modelling that DO variability is often associated with AMOC changes, as suggested by climate models of varying complexity  and marine proxy records ; but also potential influences of seaice cover , atmosphere circulation and ice sheet topography  have been proposed. The widespread presence of massive layers of ice-rafted detritus in North Atlantic marine sediments provide robust evidence that some DO GS, known as Heinrich stadials, were associated with iceberg discharges originating from the Northern Hemispheric ice sheets. During these periods global sea level rose by up to several tens of meters , with remaining uncertainties in timing and amplitude of sea level rise, stadial cooling and ocean circulation changes relative to the iceberg discharge . Internal instabilities of the Laurentide ice sheet can cause massive calving and meltwater events similar to those reconstructed from proxy records . Alternatively, an initial weakening of the AMOC can lead to subsurface warming in parts of the North Atlantic  and subsequent basal melting of the Labrador ice shelves, and a resulting acceleration of ice streams and iceberg discharge . At present, unresolved dynamics in ice sheet models and limited proxy information do not allow us to distinguish the two mechanisms with confidence. Since AR4, climate model simulations  have further confirmed the finding  that changes in AMOC strength induce abrupt climate changes with magnitude and patterns resembling reconstructed paleoclimate-proxy data of DO and Heinrich events. Recent studies have presented a better understanding of the global imprints of DO events and Heinrich events, for various regions. Widespread North Atlantic cooling and sea-ice anomalies during GS induced atmospheric circulation changes  (Krebs and Timmermann, 2007; Clement and Peterson, 2008; Kageyama et al., 2010; Merkel et al., 2010; Otto-Bliesner and Brady, 2010; Timmermann et	0
al., 2010) which in turn affected inter-hemispheric tropical rainfall patterns, leading to drying in Northern South America , the Mediterranean , equatorial western Africa and Arabia , wide parts of Asia   as well as in the Australian-Indonesian monsoon region . Concomitant wetter conditions have been reconstructed for southwestern North America  and southern South America  . Moreover, atmospheric circulation changes have been invoked  to explain temperature variations in the North Pacific that varied in unison with abrupt climate change in the North Atlantic region . Other factors that may have contributed to North Pacific climate anomalies include large-scale Pacific Ocean circulation changes  during phases of a weak AMOC. Recent high-resolution ice core studies  show that Antarctica warmed gradually for most GS, reaching maximum values at the time of GS/GI transitions, which is in agreement with the bipolar seesaw concept . A recent global temperature compilation , Southern Ocean temperature records , evidence from SH terrestrial records  and transient climate model experiments  provide multiple lines of evidence for the inter-hemispheric character of millennial-scale variability during the last glacial termination and for DO events .	0
The existence of threshold behaviour in the EAIS is consistent with an abrupt increase in Antarctic ice volume at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, 33 Ma, attributed to gradual atmospheric CO2 concentration decline on geological time scale  . Ice sheet models produce a hysteresis behaviour of the EAIS with respect to CO2 concentrations, leading to EAIS glaciation when CO2 concentration declined to 600- 900 ppm  and deglaciation for CO2 above 1200 ppm . Proxy records suggest that the WAIS might have collapsed during last interglacials  and was absent during warm periods of the Pliocene when CO2 concentration was 350 to 450 ppm  and global sea level was higher than present . These reconstructions and one ice sheet model simulation  suggest that WAIS is very sensitive to the subsurface ocean temperature. This implies, with medium confidence, that a large part of the WAIS will be eventually lost if the atmospheric CO2 concentration stays within, or above, the range of 350 to 450 ppm for several millennia.	0
Numerous modelling studies demonstrate that increased freshwater flux into the North Atlantic leads to weakening of the AMOC. Results of EMICs  and coupled GCMs also suggest that AMOC may have multiple equilibrium states under present or glacial climate conditions . Experiments with climate models provide evidence that the sensitivity of the AMOC to freshwater perturbation is larger for glacial boundary conditions than for interglacial conditions  and that the recovery time scale of the AMOC is longer for LGM conditions than for the Holocene . The abrupt climate-change event at 8.2 ka permits the study of the recovery time of the AMOC to freshwater perturbation under near-modern boundary conditions . Since AR4, new proxy records and simulations confirm that the pattern of surface-ocean and atmospheric climate anomalies is consistent with a reduction in the strength of the AMOC . Available 433	0

meltwater release may have been as short as 0.5 years , but new drainage estimates indicate an up to 200 year-duration in two separate stages . A four-model ensemble with a one-year freshwater perturbation of 2.5 Sv only gives temperature anomalies half of what has been reconstructed and with a shorter duration than observed, resulting from unresolved processes in models, imprecise representation of the initial climate state or a too short duration of the freshwater forcing . These marine-based reconstructions consistently show that the recovery time scale of the shallow and deep overturning circulation is on the order of 200 years  , with one record pointing to a partial recovery on a decadal time scale . Both recovery time scale and sensitivity of the AMOC to the freshwater perturbation are generally consistent with model experiments for the 8.2 ka event using coarse-resolution models, GCMs and eddy permitting models . The recovery of temperatures out of the cold anomaly appears overprinted with natural variability in the proxy data, and is more gradual in data than in the AOGCM experiments . In summary, multiple lines of evidence indicate, with high confidence, that the interglacial mode of the AMOC can recover from a short-term freshwater input into the subpolar North Atlantic. The characteristic teleconnection patterns associated with a colder North Atlantic Ocean as described in Section 5.7 are evident for the 8.2 ka event in both models and proxy data .	0
Since orbital forcing can be accurately calculated for the future , efforts can be made to predict the onset of the next glacial period. However, the glaciation threshold depends not only on insolation but also on the atmospheric CO2 concentration . Models of different complexity have been used to investigate the response to orbital forcing in the future for a range of atmospheric CO2 levels. These results consistently show that a glacial inception is not expected to happen within the next approximate 50 kyr if either atmospheric CO2 concentration remains above 300 ppm or cumulative carbon emissions exceed 1000 PgC . Only if atmospheric CO2 content was below the pre-industrial level would a glaciation be possible under present orbital configuration . Simulations with climate-carbon cycle models show multi-millennial lifetime of the anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere . Even for the lowest RCP 2.6 scenario, atmospheric CO2 concentrations will exceed 300 ppm until the year 3000. It is therefore virtually certain that orbital forcing will not trigger a glacial inception before the end of the next millennium.	0
The assessments in this chapter are based on a rapidly growing body of new evidence from the peer-review literature. Since AR4, there exists a wide range of new information on past changes in atmospheric composition, sea level, regional climates including droughts and floods, as well as new results from internationally coordinated model experiments on past climates . At the regional scale proxybased temperature estimates are still scarce for key regions such as Africa, India and parts of the Americas. Syntheses of past precipitation changes were too limited to support regional assessments. Precise knowledge of past changes in atmospheric concentrations of well-mixed GHGs prior to the period for which ice core records are available remains a strong limitation on assessing longer-term climate change. Key limitations to our knowledge of past climate continues to be associated with uncertainties of the quantitative information derived from climate proxies, in particular due to seasonality effects, the lack of proxy records sensitive to winter temperature, or the precise water depth at which ocean proxies signals form. Moreover, methodological uncertainties associated with regional, hemispheric or global syntheses need to be further investigated and quantified. Despite progress on developing proxy records of past changes in sea ice it is not yet possible to provide quantitative and spatially coherent assessments of past sea ice cover in both polar oceans. While this assessment could build on improved reconstructions of abrupt climate changes during glacial periods, key questions remain open regarding the underlying cause of these changes. Large uncertainties remain on the variations experienced by the West and East Antarctic ice sheets over various time scales of the past. Regarding past sea level change, major difficulties are associated with deconvolving changes in ocean geodynamic effects, as well as for inferring global signals from regional reconstructions. The PMIP3/CMIP5 model framework offers the opportunity to directly incorporate information from paleoclimate data and simulations into assessments of future projections. This is an emerging field for which only preliminary information was available for AR5.	0

AR5: For the last glacial termination, a large-scale temperature reconstruction  documents that temperature change in the SH lead NH temperature change. This lead can be explained by the bipolar thermal seesaw concept   and the related changes in the inter-hemispheric ocean heat transport, caused by weakening of the Atlantic Ocean meridional overturning circulation  during the last glacial termination . SH warming prior to NH warming can also be explained by the fast sea ice response to changes in austral spring insolation . According to these mechanisms, SH temperature lead over the NH is fully consistent with the NH orbital forcing of deglacial ice volume changes  and the importance of the climate-carbon cycle feedbacks in glacial-interglacial transitions. The tight coupling is further highlighted by the near-zero lag between the deglacial rise in CO2 and averaged deglacial Antarctic temperature recently reported from improved estimates of gas-ice age differences . Previous studies  suggesting a temperature lead of 800  600 years over the deglacial CO2 rise probably overestimated gas-ice age differences.	0
AR4: High-resolution ice core records of temperature proxies and CO2 during deglaciation indicates that Antarctic temperature starts to rise several hundred years before CO2 . During the last deglaciation, and possibly also the three previous ones, the onset of warming at both high southern and northern latitudes preceded by several thousand years the first signals of significant sea level increase resulting from the melting of the northern ice sheets linked with the rapid warming at high northern latitudes . Current data are not accurate enough to identify whether warming started earlier in the SH or NH, but a major deglacial feature is the difference between North and South in terms of the magnitude and timing of strong reversals in the warming trend, which are not in phase between the hemispheres and are more pronounced in the NH .	0

The synchronism between rapid shifts in Greenland climate and in atmospheric CH4 variations allows to transfer GICC05 to Greenland and then to Antarctic CH4 variations . Additional point: CO2-Antarctic temperature phase during AIM events. Studies on CO2 phasing relative to CH4 during Dansgaard Oeschger  event onsets  suggest a lag of maximum CO2 concentration relative to the Antarctic Isotope Maxima  19, 20, 21, 23 and 24 by 260  220 years during MIS5 and 670 to 870 years  360 years relative to AIM 12, 14, 17 during MIS3 . Accordingly, the lag is dependent on the climate state. A lag is not discernible for shorter AIM. This study avoids the ice age-gas age difference problem, but relies on the bipolar seesaw concept, i.e., it assumes that maximum Antarctic temperatures are coincident to the onset of DO events and the concurrent CH4 increase.	0

Section 5.3.5 assesses knowledge of changes in hemispheric and global temperature over the last 2 ka from a range of studies, reconstructions and simulations. Tables 5.A.1 and 5.A.6 provide further information about the datasets used in Figures 5.7-5.9 and 5.12, and the construction of Figure 5.8 is described in more detail. All reconstructions assessed in, or published since, AR4 were considered, but those that have been superseded by a related study using an expanded proxy dataset and/or updated statistical methods were excluded. Figure 5.8 compares simulated and reconstructed NH temperature changes . Some reconstructions represent a smaller spatial domain than the full NH or a specific season, while annual temperatures for the full NH mean are shown for the simulations. Multi-model means and estimated 90% multi-model ranges are shown by the thick and thin lines, respectively, for two groups of simulations : those forced by stronger  solar variability in red . Note that the strength of the solar variability is not the only difference between these groups: the GCMs and the other forcings are also different between the groups. In Figure 5.7, the reconstructions are shown as deviations from their 1881-1980 means, which allows them to be compared with the instrumental record. In Figure 5.8a, all timeseries are expressed as anomalies from their 1500-1850 mean  because the comparison of simulations and reconstructions is less sensitive to errors in anthropogenic aerosol forcing applied to the models when a pre-industrial reference period is used, and less sensitive to different realisations of internal variability with a multi-century reference period. The grey shading represents a measure of the overlapping reconstruction confidence intervals, with scores of 1 and 2 assigned to temperatures within 1.645 standard deviation  or 1 standard deviation, respectively, then summed over all reconstructions and scaled so that the maximum score is dark grey, and minimum score is pale grey. This allows the multi-model ensembles to be compared with the ensemble of reconstructed NH temperatures, taking into account the published confidence intervals.	0

Executive Summary This chapter addresses the biogeochemical cycles of carbon dioxide , methane  and nitrous oxide . The three greenhouse gases  have increased in the atmosphere since pre-industrial times, and this increase is the main driving cause of climate change . CO2, CH4 and N2O altogether amount to 80% of the total radiative forcing from well-mixed GHGs . The increase of CO2, CH4 and N2O is caused by anthropogenic emissions from the use of fossil fuel as a source of energy and from land use and land use changes, in particular agriculture. The observed change in the atmospheric concentration of CO2, CH4 and N2O results from the dynamic balance between anthropogenic emissions, and the perturbation of natural processes that leads to a partial removal of these gases from the atmosphere. Natural processes are linked to physical conditions, chemical reactions and biological transformations and they respond themselves to perturbed atmospheric composition and climate change. Therefore, the physical climate system and the biogeochemical cycles of CO2, CH4 and N2O are coupled. This chapter addresses the present human-caused perturbation of the biogeochemical cycles of CO2, CH4 and N2O, their variations in the past coupled to climate variations and their projected evolution during this century under future scenarios.	0
The Human-Caused Perturbation in the Industrial Era CO2 increased by 40% from 278 ppm about 1750 to 390.5 ppm in 2011. During the same time interval, CH4 increased by 150% from 722 ppb to 1803 ppb, and N2O by 20% from 271 ppb to 324.2 ppb in 2011. It is unequivocal that the current concentrations of atmospheric CO2, CH4 and N2O exceed any level measured for at least the past 800,000 years, the period covered by ice cores. Furthermore, the average rate of increase of these three gases observed over the past century exceeds any observed rate of change over the previous 20,000 years. With a very high level of confidence1, the increase in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning and those arising from land use change are the dominant cause of the observed increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. About half of the emissions remained in the atmosphere  since 1750. The rest was removed from the atmosphere by sinks and stored in the natural	0
of reactive nitrogen in soils and in the ocean. Anthropogenic N2O emissions increased steadily over the last two decades and were 6.9  TgN  yr-1 in 2006. Anthropogenic N2O emissions are 1.7 to 4.8 TgN  yr-1 from the application of nitrogenous fertilisers in agriculture, 0.2 to 1.8 TgN  yr-1 from fossil fuel use and industrial processes, 0.2 to 1.0 TgN  yr-1 from biomass burning  and 0.4 to 1.3 TgN  yr-1 from land emissions due to atmospheric nitrogen deposition . Natural N2O emissions derived from soils, oceans and a small atmospheric source are together 5.4 to 19.6 TgN  yr-1. 	0
Before the Human-Caused Perturbation During the last 7000 years prior to 1750, atmospheric CO2 from ice cores shows only very slow changes  from 260 ppm to 280 ppm, in contrast to the human-caused increase of CO2 since pre-industrial times. The contribution of CO2 emissions from early anthropogenic land use is unlikely sufficient to explain the CO2 increase prior to 1750. Atmospheric CH4 from ice cores increased by about 100 ppb between 5000 years ago and around 1750. About as likely as not, this increase can be attributed to early human activities involving livestock, human-caused fires and rice cultivation. 	0
under all RCPs, but with some models simulating a net loss of carbon by the land due to the combined effect of climate change and land use change. In view of the large spread of model results and incomplete process representation, there is low confidence on the magnitude of modelled future land carbon changes. There is medium confidence that emissions of CH4 from wetlands are likely to increase under elevated CO2 and a warmer climate. But there is low confidence in quantitative projections of these changes. The likelihood of the future release of CH4 from marine	0
Geoengineering Methods and the Carbon Cycle Unconventional ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere on a large scale are termed Carbon Dioxide Removal  methods. CDR could in theory be used to reduce CO2 atmospheric concentrations but these methods have biogeochemical and technological limitations to their potential. Uncertainties make it difficult to quantify how much CO2 emissions could be offset by CDR on a human time scale, although it is likely that CDR would have to be deployed at large-scale for at least one century to be able to significantly reduce atmospheric CO2. In addition, it is virtually certain that the removal of CO2 by CDR will be partially offset by outgassing of CO2 from the ocean and land ecosystems. 	0
Irreversible Long-Term Impacts of Human-Caused Emissions With very high confidence, the physical, biogeochemical carbon cycle in the ocean and on land will continue to respond to climate change and rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations created during the 21st century. Ocean acidification will very likely continue in the future as long as the oceans take up atmospheric CO2. Committed land ecosystem carbon cycle changes will manifest themselves further beyond the end of the 21st century. In addition, it is virtually certain that large areas of permafrost will experience thawing over multiple centuries. There is, however, low confidence in the magnitude of frozen carbon losses to the atmosphere, and the relative contributions of CO2 and CH4 emissions. 	0
The radiative properties of the atmosphere are strongly influenced by the abundance of well-mixed GHGs , mainly carbon dioxide , methane  and nitrous oxide , which have substantially increased since the beginning of the Industrial Era , due primarily to anthropogenic emissions . Well-mixed GHGs represent the gaseous phase of global biogeochemical cycles, which control the complex flows and transformations of the elements between the different components of the Earth System  by biotic and abiotic processes. Since most of these processes are themselves also dependent on the prevailing environment, changes in climate and human impacts on ecosystems  also modify the atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O. During the glacial-interglacial cycles , in absence of significant direct human impacts, long variations in climate also affected CO2, CH4 and N2O and vice versa . In the coming century, the situation would be quite different, because of the dominance of anthropogenic emissions that affect global biogeochemical cycles, and in turn, climate change . Biogeochemical cycles thus constitute feedbacks in the Earth System. This chapter summarizes the scientific understanding of atmospheric budgets, variability and trends of the three major biogeochemical greenhouse gases, CO2, CH4 and N2O, their underlying source and sink processes and their perturbations caused by direct human impacts, past and present climate changes as well as future projections of climate change. After the introduction , Section 6.2 assesses the present understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the variations of CO2, CH4 and N2O in the past emphasizing glacial-interglacial changes, and the smaller variations during the Holocene  since the last glaciation and over the last millennium. Section 6.3 focuses on the Industrial Era addressing the major source and sink processes, and their variability in space and time. This information is then used to evaluate critically the models of the biogeochemical cycles, including their sensitivity to changes in atmospheric composition and climate. Section 6.4 assesses future projections of carbon and other biogeochemical cycles computed, in particular, with CMIP5 Earth System Models. This includes a quantitative assessment of the direction and magnitude of the various feedback mechanisms as represented in current models, as well as additional processes that might become important in the future but which are not yet fully understood. Finally, Section 6.5 addresses the potential effects and uncertainties of deliberate carbon dioxide removal methods  and solar radiation management  on the carbon cycle.	0
carbon in the atmosphere, the ocean, surface ocean sediments and on land in vegetation, soils and freshwaters. Reservoir turnover times, defined as reservoir mass of carbon divided by the exchange flux, range from a few years for the atmosphere to decades to millennia for the major carbon reservoirs of the land vegetation and soil and the various domains in the ocean. A second, slow domain consists of the huge carbon stores in rocks and sediments which exchange carbon with the fast domain through volcanic emissions of CO2, chemical weathering , erosion and sediment formation on the sea floor . Turnover times of the  reservoirs of the slow domain are 10,000 years or longer. Natural exchange fluxes between the slow and the fast domain of the carbon cycle are relatively small  and can be assumed as approximately constant in time  over the last few centuries, although erosion and river fluxes may have been modified by human-induced changes in land use . During the Holocene  prior to the Industrial Era the fast domain was close to a steady state, as evidenced by the relatively small variations of atmospheric CO2 recorded in ice cores , despite small emissions from human-caused changes in land use over the last millennia . By contrast, since the beginning of the Industrial Era, fossil fuel extraction from geological reservoirs, and their combustion, has resulted in the transfer of significant amount of fossil carbon from the slow domain into the fast domain, thus causing an unprecedented, major human-induced perturbation in the carbon cycle. A schematic of the global carbon cycle with focus on the fast domain is shown in Figure 6.1. The numbers represent the estimated current pool sizes in PgC and the magnitude of the different exchange fluxes in PgC yr-1 averaged over the time period 2000-2009 . In the atmosphere, CO2 is the dominant carbon bearing trace gas with a current  concentration of approximately 390.5 ppm , which corresponds to a mass of 828 PgC . Additional trace gases include methane  and carbon monoxide , and still smaller amounts of hydrocarbons, black carbon aerosols and organic compounds. The terrestrial biosphere reservoir contains carbon in organic compounds in vegetation living biomass  and in dead organic matter in litter and soils . There is an additional amount of old soil carbon in wetland soils  and in permafrost soils  ; albeit some overlap with these two quantities. CO2 is removed from the atmosphere by plant photosynthesis , 1238 PgC yr-1, ) and carbon fixed into plants is then cycled through plant tissues, litter and soil carbon and can be released back into the atmosphere by autotrophic  and heterotrophic  respiration and additional disturbance processes  on a very wide range of time scales . Because CO2 uptake by photosynthesis occurs only during the growing season, whereas CO2 release by respiration occurs nearly yearround, the greater land mass in the Northern Hemisphere  imparts	0
Figure 6.1 | Simplified schematic of the global carbon cycle. Numbers represent reservoir mass, also called `carbon stocks' in PgC  and annual carbon exchange fluxes . Black numbers and arrows indicate reservoir mass and exchange fluxes estimated for the time prior to the Industrial Era, about 1750 . Fossil fuel reserves are from GEA  and are consistent with numbers used by IPCC WGIII for future scenarios. The sediment storage is a sum of 150 PgC of the organic carbon in the mixed layer  and 1600 PgC of the deep-sea CaCO3 sediments available to neutralize fossil fuel CO2 . Red arrows and numbers indicate annual `anthropogenic' fluxes averaged over the 2000-2009 time period. These fluxes are a perturbation of the carbon cycle during Industrial Era post 1750. These fluxes  are: Fossil fuel and cement emissions of CO2 , Net land use change , and the Average atmospheric increase of CO2 in the atmosphere, also called `CO2 growth rate' . The uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the ocean and by terrestrial ecosystems, often called `carbon sinks' are the red arrows part of Net land flux and Net ocean flux. Red numbers in the reservoirs denote cumulative changes of anthropogenic carbon over the Industrial Period 1750-2011 . By convention, a positive cumulative change means that a reservoir has gained carbon since 1750. The cumulative change of anthropogenic carbon in the terrestrial reservoir is the sum of carbon cumulatively lost through land use change and carbon accumulated since 1750 in other ecosystems . Note that the mass balance of the two ocean carbon stocks Surface ocean and Intermediate and deep ocean includes a yearly accumulation of anthropogenic carbon . Uncertainties are reported as 90% confidence intervals. Emission estimates and land and ocean sinks  are from Table 6.1 in Section 6.3. The change of gross terrestrial fluxes  has been estimated from CMIP5 model results . The change in air-sea exchange fluxes  have been estimated from the difference in atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 since 1750 . Individual gross fluxes and their changes since the beginning of the Industrial Era have typical uncertainties of more than 20%, while their differences  are determined from independent measurements with a much higher accuracy . Therefore, to achieve an overall balance, the values of the more uncertain gross fluxes have been adjusted so that their difference matches the Net land flux and Net ocean flux estimates. Fluxes from volcanic eruptions, rock weathering , export of carbon from soils to rivers, burial of carbon in freshwater lakes and reservoirs and transport of carbon by rivers to the ocean are all assumed to be pre-industrial fluxes, that is, unchanged during 1750-2011. Some recent studies  indicate that this assumption is likely not verified, but global estimates of the Industrial Era perturbation of all these fluxes was not available from peer-reviewed literature. The atmospheric inventories have been calculated using a conversion factor of 2.12 PgC per ppm .	0
phytoplankton and other microorganisms, represent a small organic carbon pool , which is turned over very rapidly in days to a few weeks. Carbon is transported within the ocean by three mechanisms :  the `solubility pump' ,  the `biological pump' , and  the `marine carbonate pump' that is generated by the formation of calcareous shells of certain oceanic microorganisms in the surface ocean, which, after sinking to depth, are re-mineralized back into DIC and calcium ions. The marine carbonate pump operates counter to the marine biological soft-tissue pump with respect to its effect on CO2: in the formation of calcareous shells, two bicarbonate ions are split into one carbonate and one dissolved CO2 molecules, which increases the partial CO2 pressure in surface waters . Only a small fraction  of the carbon exported by biological processes  from the surface reaches the sea floor where it can be stored in sediments for millennia and longer .	0
Box 6.1 | Multiple Residence Times for an Excess of Carbon Dioxide Emitted in the Atmosphere On an average, CO2 molecules are exchanged between the atmosphere and the Earth surface every few years. This fast CO2 cycling through the atmosphere is coupled to a slower cycling of carbon through land vegetation, litter and soils and the upper ocean ; deeper soils and the deep sea ; and geological reservoirs, such as deep-sea carbonate sediments and the upper mantle  as explained in Section 6.1.1.1. Atmospheric CO2 represents only a tiny fraction of the carbon in the Earth System, the rest of which is tied up in these other reservoirs. Emission of carbon from fossil fuel reserves, and additionally from land use change  is now rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 content. The removal of all the human-emitted CO2 from the atmosphere by natural processes will take a few hundred thousand years  as shown by the timescales of the removal process shown in the table below . For instance, an extremely long atmospheric CO2 recovery time scale from a large emission pulse of CO2 has been inferred from geological evidence when during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum event about 55 million years ago a large amount of CO2 was released to the atmosphere . Based on the amount of CO2 remaining in the atmosphere after a pulse of emissions  and on the magnitude of the historical and future emissions for each RCP scenario, we assessed that about 15 to 40% of CO2 emitted until 2100 will remain in the atmosphere longer than 1000 years. Box 6.1, Table 1 | The main natural processes that remove CO2 consecutive to a large emission pulse to the atmosphere, their atmospheric CO2 adjustment time scales, and main chemical reactions involved.	0
Phase 1. Within several decades of CO2 emissions, about a third to half of an initial pulse of anthropogenic CO2 goes into the land and ocean, while the rest stays in the atmosphere . Within a few centuries, most of the anthropogenic CO2 will be in the form of additional dissolved inorganic carbon in the ocean, thereby decreasing ocean pH . Within a thousand years, the remaining atmospheric fraction of the CO2 emissions  is between 15 and 40%, depending on the amount of carbon released . The carbonate buffer capacity of the ocean decreases with higher CO2, so the larger the cumulative emissions, the higher the remaining atmospheric fraction .  472	0
Phase 2. In the second stage, within a few thousands of years, the pH of the ocean that has decreased in Phase 1 will be restored by reaction of ocean dissolved CO2 and calcium carbonate  of sea floor sediments, partly replenishing the buffer capacity of the ocean and further drawing down atmospheric CO2 as a new balance is re-established between CaCO3 sedimentation in the ocean and terrestrial weathering . This second phase will pull the remaining atmospheric CO2 fraction down to 10 to 25% of the original CO2 pulse after about 10 kyr . Phase 3. In the third stage, within several hundred thousand years, the rest of the CO2 emitted during the initial pulse will be removed from the atmosphere by silicate weathering, a very slow process of CO2 reaction with calcium silicate  and other minerals of igneous rocks . Involvement of extremely long time scale processes into the removal of a pulse of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere complicates comparison with the cycling of the other GHGs. This is why the concept of a single, characteristic atmospheric lifetime is not applicable to CO2 .	0

6.1.1.2 Methane Cycle CH4 absorbs infrared radiation relatively stronger per molecule compared to CO2 , and it interacts with photochemistry. On the other hand, the methane turnover time  is less than 10 years in the troposphere . The sources of CH4 at the surface of the Earth  can be thermogenic including  natural emissions of fossil CH4 from geological sources  and  emissions caused by leakages from fossil fuel extraction and use . There are also pyrogenic sources resulting from incomplete burning of fossil fuels and plant biomass . The biogenic sources include natural biogenic emissions predominantly from wetlands, from termites and very small emissions from the ocean . Anthropogenic biogenic emissions occur from rice	0
paddy agriculture, ruminant livestock, landfills, man-made lakes and wetlands and waste treatment. In general, biogenic CH4 is produced from organic matter under low oxygen conditions by fermentation processes of methanogenic microbes . Atmospheric CH4 is removed primarily by photochemistry, through atmospheric chemistry reactions with the OH radicals. Other smaller removal processes of atmospheric CH4 take place in the stratosphere through reaction with chlorine and oxygen radicals, by oxidation in well aerated soils, and possibly by reaction with chlorine in the marine boundary layer . A very large geological stock  in Figure 6.2; Archer ; with low confidence in estimates) of CH4 exists in the form of frozen hydrate deposits  in shallow ocean sediments and on the slopes of continental shelves, and permafrost soils.

The atmospheric inventory in the year 2011 is based on an annual globally averaged CH4 concentration of 1803  4 ppb in the year 2011 . It is the sum of the atmospheric increase between 1750 and 2011  and of the pre-industrial inventory .

carbon storage in some regions. Estimation of this CO2 source to the atmosphere requires knowledge of changes in land area as well as estimates of the carbon stored per area before and after the land use change. In addition, longer term effects, such as the decomposition of soil organic matter after land use change, have to be taken into account . Since 1750, anthropogenic land use changes have resulted into about 50 million km2 being used for cropland and pasture, corresponding to about 38% of the total ice-free land area , in contrast to an estimated cropland and pasture area of 7.5 to 9 million km2 about 1750 . The cumulative net CO2 emissions from land use changes between 1750 and 2011 are estimated at approximately 180  80 PgC . Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the observed atmospheric increase in the global CO2 concentration since 1750  is caused by the anthropogenic CO2 emissions . The rising atmospheric CO2 content induces a disequilibrium in the exchange fluxes between the atmosphere and the land and oceans respectively. The rising CO2 concentration implies a rising atmospheric CO2 partial pressure  that induces a globally averaged net-airto-sea flux and thus an ocean sink for CO2 . On land, the rising atmospheric CO2 concentration fosters photosynthesis via the CO2 fertilisation effect . However, the efficacy of these oceanic and terrestrial sinks does also depend on how the excess carbon is transformed and redistributed within these sink reservoirs. The magnitude of the current sinks is shown in Figure 6.1 , together with the cumulative reservoir content changes over the industrial era  .	0
6.1.2.2 Methane Cycle After 1750, atmospheric CH4 levels rose almost exponentially with time, reaching 1650 ppb by the mid-1980s and 1803 ppb by 2011. Between the mid-1980s and the mid-2000s the atmospheric growth of CH4 declined to nearly zero . More recently since 2006, atmospheric CH4 is observed to increase again ; however, it is unclear if this is a short-term fluctuation or a new regime for the CH4 cycle . There is very high level of confidence that the atmospheric CH4 increase during the Industrial Era is caused by anthropogenic activities. The massive increase in the number of ruminants , the emissions from fossil fuel extraction and use, the expansion of rice paddy agriculture and the emissions from landfills and waste are the dominant anthropogenic CH4 sources. Total anthropogenic sources contribute at present between 50 and 65% of the total CH4 sources . The dominance of CH4 emissions located mostly in the NH  is evidenced by the observed positive north-south gradient in CH4 concentrations . Satellite-based CH4 concentration measurements averaged over the entire atmospheric column also indicate higher concentrations of CH4 above and downwind of densely populated and intensive agriculture areas where anthropogenic emissions occur .	0
6.1.3.1 Global Nitrogen Cycle Including Nitrous Oxide The biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and carbon are tightly coupled with each other owing to the metabolic needs of organisms for these two elements. Changes in the availability of one element will influence not only biological productivity but also availability and requirements for the other element  and in the longer term, the structure and functioning of ecosystems as well. Before the Industrial Era, the creation of reactive nitrogen Nr  from non-reactive atmospheric N2 occurred primarily through two natural processes: lightning and biological nitrogen fixation . BNF is a set of reactions that convert N2 to ammonia in a microbially mediated process. This input of Nr to the land and ocean biosphere was in balance with the loss of Nr though denitrification, a process that returns N2 back to the atmosphere . This equilibrium has been broken since the beginning of the Industrial Era. Nr is produced by human activities and delivered to ecosystems. During the last decades, the production of Nr by humans has been much greater than the natural production . There are three main anthropogenic sources of Nr:  the Haber-Bosch industrial process, used to make NH3 from N2, for nitrogen fertilisers and as a feedstock for some industries;  the cultivation of legumes and other crops, which increases BNF; and  the combustion of fossil fuels, which converts atmospheric N2 and fossil fuel nitrogen into nitrogen oxides  emitted to the atmosphere and re-deposited at the surface . In addition, there is a small flux from the mobilization of sequestered Nr from nitrogen-rich sedimentary rocks  . The amount of anthropogenic Nr converted back to non-reactive N2 by denitrification is much smaller than the amount of Nr produced each year, that is, about 30 to 60% of the total Nr production, with a large uncertainty . What is more certain is the amount of N2O emitted to the atmosphere. Anthropogenic sources of N2O are about the same size as natural terrestrial sources . In addition, emissions of Nr to the atmosphere, as NH3 and NOx, are caused by agriculture and fossil fuel combustion. A portion of the emitted NH3 and NOx is deposited over the continents, while the rest gets transported by winds and deposited over the oceans. This atmospheric deposition flux of Nr over the oceans is comparable to the flux going from soils to rivers and delivered to the coastal ocean . The increase of Nr creation during the Industrial Era, the connections among its impacts, including on climate and the connections with the carbon cycle are presented in Box 6.2. For the global ocean, the best BNF estimate is 160 TgN yr-1, which is roughly the midpoint of the minimum estimate of 140 TgN yr-1 of Deutsch et al.  and the maximum estimate of 177 TgN yr-1 . The probability that this estimate will need an upward revision in the near future is high because several additional processes are not yet considered . 475	0
Box 6.2 | Nitrogen Cycle and Climate-Carbon Cycle Feedbacks Human creation of reactive nitrogen by the Haber-Bosch process , fossil fuel combustion and agricultural biological nitrogen fixation  dominate Nr creation relative to biological nitrogen fixation in natural terrestrial ecosystems. This dominance impacts on the radiation balance of the Earth , and affects human health and ecosystem health as well . The Nr creation from 1850 to 2005 is shown in Box 6.2 . After mid-1970s, human production of Nr exceeded natural production. During the 2000s food production  accounts for three-quarters of Nr created by humans, with fossil fuel combustion and industrial uses accounting equally for the remainder .	1
Essentially all of the Nr formed by human activity is spread 0 into the environment, either at the point of creation  or after it is used in food production Year and in industry. Once in the environment, Nr has a number Box 6.2, Figure 1 | Anthropogenic reactive nitrogen  creation rates  of negative impacts if not converted back into N2.

In addition, Nr-induced increases in nitrogen oxides, aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and nitrates in drinking water have negative impacts on human health . Once the nitrogen atoms become reactive , any given Nr atom can contribute to all of the impacts noted above in sequence. This is called the nitrogen cascade . The nitrogen cascade is the sequential transfer of the same Nr atom through the atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems and marine ecosystems that results in multiple effects in each reservoir. Because of the nitrogen cascade, the creation of any molecule of Nr from N2, at any location, has the potential to affect climate, either directly or indirectly, as explained in this box This potential exists until the Nr gets converted back to N2. The most important processes causing direct links between anthropogenic Nr and climate change include :  N2O formation during industrial processes , combustion, or microbial conversion of substrate containing nitrogen--notably after fertiliser and manure application to soils. N2O is a strong greenhouse gas ,  emission of anthropogenic NOx leading to  formation of tropospheric O3, ,  a decrease of CH4 and  the formation of nitrate aerosols. Aerosol formation affects radiative forcing, as nitrogen-containing aerosols have a direct cooling effect in addition to an indirect cooling effect through cloud formation and  NH3 emission to the atmosphere which contributes to aerosol formation. The first process has a warming effect. The second has both a warming  and a cooling  effect. The net effect of all three NOx-related contributions is cooling. The third process has a cooling effect.	1
taken up by the biosphere; Nr affects net CO2 uptake from the atmosphere in terrestrial systems, rivers, estuaries and the open ocean in a positive direction  and negative direction . CO2 uptake in the ocean causes ocean acidification, which reduces CO2 uptake;  changes in marine primary productivity, generally an increase, in response to Nr deposition; and  O3 formed in the troposphere as a result of NOx and volatile organic compound emissions reduces plant productivity, and therefore reduces CO2 uptake from the atmosphere. On the global scale the net influence of the direct and indirect contributions of Nr on the radiative balance was estimated to be -0.24 W m-2  . Nr is required for both plants and soil microorganisms to grow, and plant and microbial processes play important roles in the global carbon cycle. The increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 is observed to increase plant photosynthesis  and plant growth, which drives an increase of carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems. Plant growth is, however, constrained by the availability of Nr in soils . This means that in some nitrogen-poor ecosystems, insufficient Nr availability will limit carbon sinks, while the deposition of Nr may instead alleviate this limitation and enable larger carbon sinks . Therefore, human production of Nr has the potential to mitigate CO2 emissions by providing additional nutrients for plant growth in some regions. Microbial growth can also be limited by the availability of Nr, particularly in cold, wet environments, so that human production of Nr also has the potential to accelerate the decomposition of organic matter, increasing release of CO2. The availability of Nr also changes in response to climate change, generally increasing with warmer temperatures and increased precipitation , but with complex interactions in the case of seasonally inundated environments. This complex network of feedbacks is amenable to study through observation and experimentation  and Earth System modelling . Even though we do not yet have a thorough understanding of how nitrogen and carbon cycling will interact with climate change, elevated CO2 and human Nr production in the future, given scenarios of human activity, current observations and model results all indicate that low nitrogen availability will limit carbon storage on land in the 21st century .	0

A global denitrification rate is much more difficult to constrain than the BNF considering the changing paradigms of nitrogen cycling in the oxygen minimum zones or the unconstrained losses in permeable sediments on the continental shelves . The coastal ocean may have losses in the range of 100 to 250 . For the open and distal ocean Codispoti  estimated an upper limit of denitrification of 400 TgN yr-1. Voss et al.  used a conservative estimate of 100 TgN yr-1 for the coastal ocean, and 200 to 300 TgN yr-1 for the open ocean. Because the upper limit in the global ocean is 400 TgN yr-1, 300  100 TgN yr-1 is the best estimate for global ocean losses of reactive nitrogen .

6.1.3.2 Oxygen Atmospheric oxygen is tightly coupled with the global carbon cycle . The burning of fossil fuels removes oxygen from the atmosphere in a tightly defined stoichiometric ratio depending on fuel carbon content. As a consequence of the burning of fossil fuels, atmospheric O2 levels have been observed to decrease steadily over the last 20 years  . Compared to the atmospheric oxygen content of about 21% this decrease is very small; however, it provides independent evidence that the rise in CO2 must be due to an oxidation process, that is, fossil fuel combustion and/or organic carbon oxidation, and is not caused by, for example, volcanic emissions or by outgassing of dissolved CO2 from a warming ocean. The atmospheric oxygen measurements furthermore also show the north-south concentration O2 difference  as expected from the stronger fossil fuel consumption in the NH . On land, during photosynthesis and respiration, O2 and CO2 are exchanged in nearly a 1:1 ratio. However, with respect to exchanges with the ocean, O2 behaves quite differently from CO2, because compared to the atmosphere only a small amount of O2 is dissolved in the ocean whereas by contrast the oceanic CO2 content is much larger due to the carbonate chemistry. This different behaviour of the two gases with respect to ocean exchange provides a powerful method to assess independently the partitioning of the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by land and ocean , Section 6.3.2.3.	0
Despite local evidence of larger carbon storage in permafrost regions during glacial periods , the 13C record of ocean waters as preserved in benthic foraminiferal shells has been used to infer that global terrestrial carbon storage was reduced in glacial times, thus opposite to recorded changes in atmospheric CO2. Data-based estimates of the deficit between LGM and pre-industrial land carbon storage range from a few hundreds to 1000 PgC . Dynamic vegetation models tend to simulate values at the higher end   and indicate a role for the physiological effects of low CO2 on photosynthesis at the LGM at least as large as that of colder and dryer climate conditions in determining the past extent of forests . 6.2.1.1.2	0
During the LGM, sea level was about ~120 m lower than today, and this change in ocean volume had several well-understood effects on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Lower sea level impacts the LGM ocean carbon cycle in two main ways. First, the resulting higher LGM ocean surface salinity causes atmospheric CO2 to be higher than during the Holocene. Second, the total dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity  become more concentrated in equal proportions, and this process also causes atmospheric CO2 to be higher during the LGM. In total, lower sea level is estimated to contribute to higher CO2 values by 15 ppm during the LGM , implying that other processes must explain the lower CO2 values measured in ice cores. 6.2.1.1.4	0
Reorganization in ocean circulation during glacial periods that promoted the retention of dissolved inorganic carbon in the deep ocean during the LGM has become the focus of most research on the glacial-interglacial CO2 problem. That ocean circulation plays a key role in low glacial period atmospheric CO2 concentration is exemplified by the tight coupling observed between reconstructed deep ocean temperatures and atmospheric CO2 . Evidence from marine bore hole sites  and from marine sediment cores  show that the glacial ocean was highly stratified compared to interglacial conditions and may thus have held a larger store of carbon during glacial times. 13CO2 ice core records , as well as radiocarbon records from deep-sea corals demonstrate the role of a deep and stratified Southern Ocean in the higher LGM ocean carbon storage. However, conflicting hypotheses exist on the drivers of this increase in the Southern Ocean stratification, for example, northward shift and weakening of Southern Hemisphere  westerly winds , reduced air-sea buoyancy fluxes  or massive brine rejections during sea ice formation . Ocean carbon cycle models have simulated a circulation-induced effect on LGM CO2 that can explain lower values than during interglacial by 3 ppm  to 57 ppm . A long-standing hypothesis is that increased LGM sea ice cover acted as a barrier to air-sea gas exchange and hence reduced the `leakage' of CO2 during winter months from the ocean to the atmosphere during glacial periods . However, concurrent changes in ocean circulation and biological productivity complicate the estimation of the impact of increased sea ice extent on LGM atmospheric CO2 . With the exception of the results of an idealised box model , ocean carbon models are relatively consistent in projecting a small effect of higher sea ice extent on maintaining atmospheric CO2 lower during LGM .	0
Both marine and terrestrial sediment records indicate higher rates of deposition of dust and hence iron  supply at the LGM , implying a potential link between Fe fertilisation of marine productivity and lower glacial CO2 . However, despite the fact that ocean carbon cycle models generally employ similar reconstructions of glacial dust fluxes , there is considerable disagreement among them in the associated CO2 change. OGCM that include a description of the Fe cycle tend to cluster at the lower end of simulated CO2 changes between glacial and interglacial , whereas box models  or Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity  tend to produce CO2 changes which are at the higher end . An alternative view comes from inferences drawn from the timing and magnitude of changes in dust and CO2 in ice cores , assigning a 20 ppm limit for the lowering of CO2 during the LGM in response to an Southern Ocean Fe fertilisation effect, and a 8 ppm limit for the same effect in the North Pacific. 6.2.1.1.6	0
A number of further aspects of altered climate and biogeochemistry at the LGM are also likely to have affected atmospheric CO2. Reduced bacterial metabolic rates and remineralization  of organic matter , increased glacial supply of dissolved silica  , `silica leakage' , changes in net global weathering rates , reduction in coral reef growth and other forms of shallow water CaCO3 accumulation , carbonate compensation  and changes in the CaCO3 to organic matter `rain ratio' to the sediments  will act to amplify or diminish the effect of many of the aforementioned drivers on glacial CO2. 6.2.1.1.7	0
All of the major drivers of the glacial-to-interglacial atmospheric CO2 changes  are likely to have already been identified. However, Earth System Models have been unable to reproduce the full magnitude of the glacial-to-interglacial CO2 changes. Significant uncertainties exist in glacial boundary conditions and on some of the primary controls on carbon storage in the ocean and in the land. These uncertainties prevent an unambiguous attribution of individual mechanisms as controllers of the low glacial CO2 concentrations. Further assessments of the interplay of different mechanisms prior to deglacial transitions or in glacial inceptions will provide additional insights into the drivers and processes that caused the glacial decrease of CO2. Because several of these identified drivers  are sensitive to climate change in general, improved understanding drawn from the glacial-interglacial cycles will help constrain the magnitude of future ocean feedbacks on atmospheric CO2. Other drivers  are involved in geoengineering methods , such that improved under481	0

Ice core measurements show that atmospheric CH4 and N2O were much lower under glacial conditions compared to interglacial ones. Their reconstructed history encompasses the last 800 ka . Glacial CH4 mixing ratios are in the 350 to 400 ppb range during the eight glacial maxima covered by the ice core record. This is about half the levels observed during interglacial conditions. The N2O concentration amounts to 202  8 ppb at the LGM, compared to the early Holocene levels of about 270 ppb . CH4 and N2O isotopic ratio measurements in ice cores provide important constraints on the mechanisms responsible for their temporal 482	0
changes. N2O isotopes suggest a similar increase in marine and terrestrial N2O emissions during the last deglaciation . Marine sediment proxies of ocean oxygenation suggest that most of the observed N2O deglacial rise was of marine origin . D and 14C isotopic composition measurements of CH4 have shown that catastrophic methane hydrate degassing events are unlikely to have caused the last deglaciation CH4 increase . 13C and D measurements of CH4 combined with interpolar atmospheric CH4 gradient changes  suggest that most of the deglacial CH4 increase was caused by increased emissions from boreal and tropical wetlands and an increase in CH4 atmospheric residence time due to a reduced oxidative capacity of the atmosphere . The biomass burning source apparently changed little on the same time scale, whereas this CH4 source experienced large fluctuations over the last millennium . Recent modelling studies, however, suggest that changes	0
Conflicting hypotheses exist on the drivers of these millennial-scale changes. Some model simulations suggest that both CO2 and N2O fluctuations can be explained by changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning ocean circulation , CO2 variations being explained mainly by changes in the efficiency of the biological pump which affects deep ocean carbon storage , whereas N2O variations could be due to changes in productivity and oxygen concentrations in the subsurface ocean . Other studies, however, suggest that the millennial-scale CO2 fluctuations can be explained by changes in the land carbon storage . For CH4, models have difficulties in reproducing changes in wetland emissions compatible with DO atmospheric variations , and the changes in the atmospheric oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere during DO events seem to be too weak to explain the CH4 changes .	0
Ice core measurements of CO2, CH4 and N2O show sharp  changes in the course of glaciations, associated with the so-called Dansgaard/Oeschger  climatic events , but their amplitude, shape and timing differ. During these millennial scale climate events, atmospheric CO2 concentrations varied by about 20 ppm, in phase with Antarctic, but not with Greenland temperatures. CO2 increased during cold  periods in Greenland, several thousands years before the time of the rapid warming event in Greenland . CH4 and N2O showed rapid transitions in phase with Greenland temperatures with little or no lag. CH4 changes are in the 50 to 200 ppb range , in phase with Greenland temperature warming at a decadal time scale . N2O changes are large, of same magnitude than glacial-interglacial changes, and for the warmest and longest DO events N2O starts to increase several centuries before Greenland temperature and CH4 .	0
between 11 and 7 ka, followed by a 20 ppm CO2 increase until the onset of the Industrial Era in 1750 . These variations in atmospheric CO2 over the past 11 kyr preceding industrialisation are more than five times smaller than the CO2 increase observed during the Industrial Era . Despite the small magnitude of CO2 variations prior to the Industrial Era, these changes are nevertheless useful for understanding the role of natural forcing in carbon and other biogeochemical cycles during interglacial climate conditions. Since the IPCC AR4, the mechanisms underlying the observed 20 ppm CO2 increase between 7 ka and the Industrial Era have been a matter of intensive debate. During three interglacial periods prior to the Holocene, CO2 did not increase, and this led to a hypothesis that pre-industrial anthropogenic CO2 emissions could be associated with early land use change and forest clearing . However, ice core CO2 data  indicate that during Marine Isotope Stage 11 , an interglacial period that lasted from 400 to 420 ka, CO2 increased similarly to the Holocene period. Drivers of atmospheric CO2 changes during the Holocene can be divided into oceanic and terrestrial processes  and their roles are examined below. 6.2.2.1.1	0
The change in oceanic carbonate chemistry could explain the slow atmospheric CO2 increase during the Holocene since 7 ka. Proposed mechanisms include:  a shift of oceanic carbonate sedimentation from deep sea to the shallow waters due to sea level rise onto continental shelves causing accumulation of CaCO3 on shelves including coral reef growth, a process that releases CO2 to the atmosphere ,  a `carbonate compensation' in response to the release of carbon from the deep ocean during deglaciation and to the buildup of terrestrial biosphere in the early Holocene . Proxies for carbonate ion concentration in the deep sea  and a decrease in modern CaCO3 preservation in equatorial Pacific sediments  support the hypothesis that the ocean was a source of CO2 to the atmosphere during the Holocene. Changes in SSTs over the last 7 kyr  could have contributed to slightly lower  or higher  atmospheric CO2 concentration but, very likely, SST-driven CO2 change represents only a minor contribution to the observed CO2 increase during the Holocene after 7 ka . 6.2.2.1.2	0
ing the intensification and decline of the Afro-Asian monsoon and the mid-Holocene warming of the high latitudes of the NH are estimated in models to have caused changes in vegetation distribution and hence of terrestrial carbon storage. These climate-induced carbon storage changes are estimated using models to have been smaller than the increase due to CO2 fertilisation . The Holocene accumulation of carbon in peatlands has been reconstructed globally, suggesting a land carbon additional storage of several hundred petagrams of carbon between the early Holocene and the Industrial Era, although uncertainties remain on this estimate . Volcanic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere between 12 and 7 ka were estimated to be two to six times higher than during the last millennium, of about 0.1 PgC yr-1 . However, a peak in the inferred volcanic emissions coincides with the period of decreasing atmospheric CO2 and the confidence in changes of volcanic CO2 emissions is low. Global syntheses of the observational, paleoecological and archaeological records for Holocene land use change are not currently available . Available reconstructions of anthropogenic land use and land cover change  prior to the last millennium currently extrapolate using models and assumptions from single regions to changes in all regions of the world . Because of regional differences in land use systems and uncertainty in historical population estimates, the confidence in spatially explicit LULCC reconstructions is low. Some recent studies focused on reconstructing LULCC and making very simple assumptions regarding the effect of land use on carbon . Other studies relied on more sophisticated terrestrial biosphere models to simulate carbon storage and loss in response to pre-industrial LULCC during the late Holocene . The conclusion of the aforementioned studies was that cumulative Holocene carbon emissions as a result of pre-industrial LULCC were not large enough  to have had an influence larger than an increase of ~10 ppm on late Holocene observed CO2 concentration increase . However, a modelling study by Kaplan et al.  suggested that more than 350 PgC could have been released as a result of LULCC between 8 ka and 1850 as a result of a much stronger loss of soil carbon in response to land use change, than in other studies. In addition to clearing of forests, large-scale biomass burning activity, inferred from synthesized charcoal records and bog sediments has been hypothesized to correlate with the observed Late Holocene atmospheric CO2 . A global extensive synthesis of charcoal records for the last 21 kyr  and updates of those shows that fire activity followed climate variability on global  and regional scale . There is no evidence, however, for a distinct change in fire activity linked to human activity alone as hypothesized from a regional charcoal record synthesis for the tropical Americas . Fire being a newly studied component, no estimate for its role is given in Figure 6.5.	0
The atmospheric CH4 levels decreased from the early Holocene to about 6 ka, were lowest at around 5 ka, and increased between 5 ka and year 1750 by about 100 ppb . Major Holocene agricultural developments, in particular rice paddy cultivation and widespread domestication of ruminants, have been proposed as an explanation for the Late Holocene CH4 rise . The most recent syntheses of archaeological data point to an increasing anthropogenic CH4 source from domesticated ruminants after 5 ka and from rice cultivation after 4 ka . The modelling support for either natural or anthropogenic explanations of the Late Holocene increase in the atmospheric CH4 concentration is equivocal. A study by Kaplan et al.  suggested that a part of the Late Holocene CH4 rise could be explained by anthropogenic sources. Natural wetland CH4 models driven by simulated climate changes are able  or unable  to simulate Late H  olocene increase in the CH4 concentration, reflecting a large spread in present-day CH4 emissions simulated by this type of models . Consequently, about as likely as not, the atmospheric CH4 increase after 5000 years ago can be attributed to early human activities. The mechanisms causing the N2O concentration changes during the Holocene are not firmly identified .	0
6.2.3.1 A Decrease of Carbon Dioxide around Year 1600 and Possible Explanations for this Event High resolution ice cores records reveal that atmospheric CO2 during the last millennium varied with a drop in atmospheric CO2 concentration by 7 to 10 ppm around year 1600, followed by a CO2 increase during the 17th century . This is shown in Figure 6.7. The CO2 decrease during the 17th century was used to evaluate the response of atmospheric CO2 concentration to a century-scale shift in global temperature  which was found to be dependent on the choice of global temperature reconstructions used in the model.	0
to explain the magnitude of the CO2 decrease. The drop in atmospheric CO2 around year 1600 could also be caused by a cooling from increased volcanic eruptions . A third hypothesis calls for a link between CO2 and epidemics and wars associated with forest regrowth over abandoned lands and increased carbon storage, especially in Central America. Here, results are model and scenario dependent. Simulations by Pongratz et al.  do not reproduce a decrease in CO2, while simulations by Kaplan et al.  suggest a considerable increase in land carbon storage around year 1600. The temporal resolution of Central American charcoal and pollen records is insufficient to support or falsify these model results . Ensemble simulations over the last 1200 years have been conducted using an ESM  and EMICs  including a fully interactive carbon cycle. The sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 concentration to NH temperature changes in ESM was modeled to be of 2.7 to 4.4 ppm C-1, while EMICs show on average a higher sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 to global temperature changes of 8.6 ppm C-1.These sensitivities fall within the range of 1.7 to 21.4 ppm C-1 of a recent reconstruction based on tree-ring NH temperature reconstructions .	1
Prior to the Industrial Era, that began in 1750, the concentration of atmospheric CO2 fluctuated roughly between 180 ppm and 290 ppm for at least 2.1 Myr . Between 1750 and 2011, the combustion of fossil fuels  and the production of cement have released 375  30 PgC  to the atmosphere . Land use change activities, mainly deforestation, has released an additional 180  80 PgC . This carbon released by human activities is called anthropogenic carbon. Of the 555  85 PgC of anthropogenic carbon emitted to the atmosphere from fossil fuel and cement and land use change, less than half have accumulated in the atmosphere  . The remaining anthropogenic carbon has been absorbed by the ocean and	0

6.3.2.1 Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Fossil Fuel Combustion and Cement Production Global CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels used for this chapter are determined from national energy consumption statistics and converted to emissions by fuel type . Estimated uncertainty for the annual global emissions are on the order of 8%  to the 90% confidence intervals used here). The uncertainty has been increasing in recent decades because a larger fraction of the global emissions originate from emerging economies where energy statistics and emission factors per fuel type are more uncertain . CO2 emissions from cement production were 4% of the total emissions during 2000-2009, compared to 3% in the 1990s . Additional emissions from gas flaring represent <1% of the global emissions. Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production were 7.8  0.6 PgC yr-1 on average during 2000-2009, 6.4  0.5 PgC yr-1 during 1990-1999 and 5.5  0.4 PgC yr-1 during 1980-1989 . Global fossil fuel CO2 emissions increased by 3.2% yr-1 on average during the decade 2000-2009 compared to 1.0% yr-1 in the 1990s and 1.9% yr-1 in the 1980s. Francey et al.  recently suggested a cumulative underestimation of 8.8 PgC emissions during the period 1993-2004, which would reduce the contrast in emissions growth rates between the two decades. The global financial crisis in 2008-2009 induced only a short-lived drop in global emissions in 2009 , with the return to high annual growth rates of 5.1% and 3.0% in 2010 and 2011, respectively, and fossil fuel and cement CO2 emissions of 9.2  0.8 PgC in 2010 and 9.5  0.8 PgC in 2011.	0
6.3.2.2 Net Land Use Change Carbon Dioxide Flux CO2 is emitted to the atmosphere by land use and land use change activities, in particular deforestation, and taken up from the atmosphere by other land uses such as afforestation  and vegetation regrowth on abandoned lands. A critical distinction in estimating land use change is the existence of gross and net fluxes. Gross fluxes are the individual fluxes from multiple processes involved in land use change that can be either emissions to or removals from the atmosphere occurring at different time scales. For example, gross emissions include instantaneous emissions from deforestation fires and long-term emissions from the decomposition	0
of organic carbon; and they also include the long-term CO2 uptake by forest regrowth and soil carbon storage on abandoned agricultural lands, afforestation and storage changes of wood products . The net flux of land use change is the balance among all source and sink processes involved in a given timeframe. The net flux of land use change is globally a net source to the atmosphere . Approaches to estimate global net CO2 fluxes from land use fall into three categories:  the `bookkeeping' method that tracks carbon in living vegetation, dead plant material, wood products and soils with cultivation, harvesting and reforestation using country-level reports on changes in forest area and biome-averaged biomass values ;  process-based terrestrial ecosystem models that simulate on a grid-basis the carbon stocks  and exchange fluxes between vegetation, soil and atmosphere  and  detailed regional  analyses based on satellite data that estimate changes in forest area or biomass . Satellite-derived estimates of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from so-called deforestation fires  provide additional constraints on the spatial attribution and variability of land use change gross emissions. Most global estimates do not include emissions from peat burning or decomposition after a land use change, which are estimated to be 0.12 PgC yr-1 over 1997-2006 for peat fires  and between 0.10 and 0.23 PgC yr-1 from the decomposition of drained peat . The processes and time scales captured by these methods to estimate net land use change CO2 emissions are diverse, creating difficulties with comparison of different estimates . The bookkeeping method of Houghton et al.  was used for Table 6.1 because it is closest to observations and includes the most extensive set of management practices . Methods that do not include long-term `legacy' fluxes from soils caused by deforestation  underestimate net land use change CO2 emissions by 13 to 62% depending on the starting year and decade , and methods that do not include the fate of carbon wood harvest and shifting cultivation underestimate CO2 emissions by 25 to 35% . Global net CO2 emissions from land use change are estimated at 1.4, 1.5 and 1.1 PgC yr-1 for the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, respectively, by the bookkeeping method of Houghton et al.  . This estimate is consistent with global emissions simulated by process-based terrestrial ecosystem models using mainly three land cover change data products as input for time-varying maps of land use change . The bookkeeping method estimate is also generally consistent although higher than the satellite-based methods . Part of the discrepancy can be accounted for by emissions from extratropical regions  and by legacy fluxes for land cover change prior to 1980s  that are not covered by satellite-based methods used in Table 6.2, and by the fact that the bookkeeping method accounts for degradation and shifting agriculture CO2 losses not detected in the satellite-based method reported in Table 6.2. We adopt an uncertainty of 0.8 PgC yr-1 as representative of 90% uncertainty intervals. This is identical to the uncertainty of 0.5 PgC yr-1 representing 1- interval  489	0

originate from Central and South America, Africa and Tropical Asia since the 1980s . The process models based on the HYDE database allocate about 30% of the global land use change emissions to East Asia, but this is difficult to reconcile with the large afforestation programmes reported in this region. Inconsistencies in the available land cover change reconstructions and in the modelling results prevent a firm assessment of recent trends and their partitioning among regions . In this chapter, we do not assess individual gross fluxes that sum up to make the net land use change CO2 emission, because there are too few independent studies. Gross emissions from tropical deforestation and degradation were 3.0  0.5 PgC yr-1 for the 1990s and 2.8  0.5 PgC yr-1 for the 2000s using forest inventory data, FAO  and the bookeeping method . These gross emissions are about double the net emissions because of the presence of a large regrowth that compensates for about half of the gross emissions. A recent analysis estimated a lower gross deforestation of 0.6 to 1.2 PgC yr-1 . That study primarily estimated permanent deforestation and excluded additional gross emissions from degraded forests, shifting agriculture and some carbon pools. In fact, gross emissions from	0
permanent deforestation are in agreement between the bookkeeping method of Houghton et al.  and the satellite data analysis of Harris et al. . Over the 1750-2011 period, cumulative net CO2 emissions from land use change of 180  80 PgC are estimated . The uncertainty is based on the spread of the available estimates . The cumulative net CO2 emissions from land use change have been dominated by deforestation and other land use change in the mid-northern latitudes prior to 1980s, and in the tropics since the 1980s, largely from deforestation in tropical America and Asia with smaller contributions from tropical Africa. Deforestation from 800 to 1750 has been estimated at 27 PgC using a process-based ecosystem model .	0

There is substantial evidence, for example, from 13C carbon isotopes in atmospheric CO2  that source/sink processes on land generate most of the interannual variability in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate . The strong positive anomalies of the CO2 growth rate in El Nino years  originated in tropical latitudes , while the anomalies in 2003 and 2005 originated in northern mid-latitudes, perhaps reflecting the European heat wave in 2003 . Volcanic forcing also contributes to multi-annual variability in carbon storage on land and in the ocean . With a very high confidence, the increase in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning and those arising from land use change are the dominant	0
A positive trend in airborne fraction of ~0.3% yr-1 relative to the mean of 0.44 0.06  was found by all recent studies  using the airborne fraction of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions over the approximately 1960-2010 period . However, there is no consensus on the significance of the trend because of differences in the treatment of uncertainty and noise . There is also no consensus on the cause of the trend . Land and ocean carbon cycle model results attributing the trends of fluxes to underlying processes suggest that the effect of climate change and variability on ocean and land sinks have had a significant influence , including the decadal influence of volcanic eruptions .	0
Until recently, the uncertainty in CO2 emissions from land use change emissions was large and poorly quantified which led to the use of an airborne fraction  based on CO2 emissions from fossil fuel only . H  owever, reduced uncertainty of emissions from land use change and larger agreement in its trends over time  allow making use of an airborne fraction that includes all anthropogenic emissions. The airborne fraction will increase if emissions are too fast for the uptake of CO2 by the carbon sinks . It is thus controlled by changes in emissions rates, and by changes in carbon sinks driven by rising CO2, changes in climate and all other biogeochemical changes.	0

phere and is limited mainly by the rate at which anthropogenic CO2 is transported from the surface waters into the deep ocean . This anthropogenic ocean CO2 sink occurs on top of a very active natural oceanic carbon cycle. Recent climate trends, such as ocean warming, changes in ocean circulation and changes in marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, can have affected both the anthropogenic ocean CO2 sink as well as the natural air-sea CO2 fluxes. We report a decadal mean uptake of 2.0  0.7 PgC yr-1 for the 1980s and of 2.3  0.7 PgC yr-1 for the 2000s . The methods used are:  an empirical Green's function approach fitted to observations of transient ocean tracers ,  a model-based Green's function approach fitted to anthropogenic carbon reconstructions ,  estimates based on empirical relationships between observed ocean surface pCO2 and temperature and salinity  and  process-based global ocean biogeochemical models forced by observed meteorological fields . All these different methods suggest that in the absence of recent climate change and climate variability, the ocean anthropogenic CO2 sink should have increased by 0.23  0.15 PgC yr-1 between the 1980s and the 1990s, and by 0.33  0.13 PgC yr-1 between the 1990s and the 2000s (Figure 496	0
Observational-based estimates for the global ocean inventory of anthropogenic carbon are obtained from shipboard repeated hydrographic cross sections . These estimates agree well among each other, with an average value of 155  30 PgC of increased dissolved inorganic carbon for the period 1750-2011 . The uptake of anthropogenic carbon into the ocean is observed to be larger in the high latitudes than in the tropics and subtropics over the entire Industrial Era, because of the more vigorous ocean convection in the high latitudes . A number of ocean cross sections have been repeated over the last decade, and the observed changes	0
Observations of the partial pressure of CO2 at the ocean surface  show that ocean pCO2 has been increasing generally at about the same rate as CO2 in the atmosphere when averaged over large ocean regions during the past two to three decades . However, analyses of regional observations highlight substantial regional and temporal variations around the mean trend. In the North Atlantic, repeated observations show ocean pCO2 increasing regionally either at the same rate or faster than atmospheric CO2 between about 1990 and 2006 , thus indicating a constant or decreasing sink for CO2 in that region, in contrast to the increasing sink expected from the response of the ocean to increasing 497	0
atmospheric CO2 alone. The anomalous North Atlantic trends appear to be related to sea surface warming and its effect on solubility  and/or changes in ocean circulation  and deep convection . Recent changes have been associated with decadal variability in the North Atlantic Oscillation  and the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability  . A systematic analysis of trends estimated in this region show no agreement regarding the drivers of change . In the Southern Ocean, an approximately constant sink was inferred from atmospheric  and oceanic  CO2 observations but the uncertainties are large . Most ocean biogeochemistry models reproduce the constant sink and attribute it as a response to an increase in Southern Ocean winds driving increased upwards transport of carbon-rich deep waters . The increase in winds has been attributed to the depletion of stratospheric ozone  with a contribution from GHGs . Large decadal variability has been observed in the Equatorial Pacific  associated with changes in the phasing of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation  and its impact on gas transfer velocity . By contrast, ocean pCO2 appears to have increased at a slower rate than atmospheric CO2  in the northern North Pacific Ocean . There is less evidence available to attribute the observed changes in other regions to changes in underlying processes or climate change and variability. 6.3.2.5.5	0
Three type of processes are estimated to have an important effect on the air-sea CO2 fluxes on century time scales:  the dissolution of CO2 at the ocean surface and its chemical equilibrium with other forms of carbon in the ocean ,  the transport of carbon between the surface and the intermediate and deep ocean and  changes in the cycling of carbon through marine ecosystem processes . The surface dissolution and equilibration of CO2 with the atmosphere is well understood and quantified. It varies with the surface ocean conditions, in particular with temperature  and alkalinity. The capacity of the ocean to take up additional CO2 for a given alkalinity decreases at higher temperature  and at elevated CO2 concentrations . Recent changes in nutrient supply in the ocean are also thought to have changed the export of organic carbon from biological processes below the surface layer, and thus the ocean CO2 sink . Anthropogenic reactive nitrogen Nr  entering the ocean via atmospheric deposition or rivers acts as a fertiliser and may enhance carbon export to depth and hence the CO2 sink. This Nr 498	0
contribution has been estimated to be between 0.1 and 0.4 PgC yr-1 around the year 2000 using models . Similarly, increases in iron deposition over the ocean from dust generated by human activity is estimated to have enhanced the ocean cumulative CO2 uptake by 8 PgC during the 20th century  . Although changes in ocean circulation and in global biogeochemical drivers have the potential to alter the ocean carbon fluxes through changes in marine ecosystems, modelling studies show only small variability in ocean biological pump, which has not significantly impacted the response of the ocean carbon cycle over the recent period . Model studies suggest that the response of the air-sea CO2 fluxes to climate change and variability in recent decades has decreased the rate at which anthropogenic CO2 is absorbed by the ocean ; Figure 6.14 and Table 6.4). This result is robust to the model or climate forcing used , but no formal attribution to anthropogenic climate change has been made. There is insufficient data coverage to separate the impact of climate change on the global ocean CO2 sink directly from observations, though the regional trends described in Section 6.3.2.5.4 suggest that surface ocean pCO2 responds to changes in ocean properties in a significant and measurable way. 6.3.2.5.6	0
Ocean process-based carbon cycle models are capable of reproducing the mean air-sea fluxes of CO2 derived from pCO2 observations , including their general patterns and amplitude , the anthropogenic uptake of CO2  and the regional distribution of air-sea fluxes . The spread between different model results for air-sea CO2 fluxes is the largest in the Southern Ocean , where intense convection occurs. Tracer observations  and water mass analysis  have been used to reduce the model uncertainty associated with this process and improve the simulation of carbon fluxes. The models reproduce the observed seasonal cycle of pCO2 in the sub-tropics but generally do poorly in sub-polar regions where the balance of processes is more difficult to simulate well . Less information is available to evaluate specifically the representation of biological fluxes in the models, outside of their realistic representation of surface ocean chlorophyll distributions. Ocean process-based carbon cycle models used in AR5 reproduce the relatively small interannual variability inferred from observations . See also Section 9.4.5. Sensitivity of modelled air-sea fluxes to CO2. Data-based studies estimated a cumulative carbon uptake of ~155  30 PgC across studies for the 1750-2011 time period , a mean anthropogenic CO2 sink of 2.2  0.7 PgC yr-1 for the 1990s, and decadal trends of 0.13 PgC yr-1 per decade during the two decades 1990-2009 , respectively. Models that have estimated these quantities give a total ocean uptake of 170  25 PgC for	0
1750-2011  until 1994, plus an additional 40 PgC from estimates in Table 6.4 for 1995-2011), a mean anthropogenic CO2 sink of 2.1  0.6 PgC yr-1 for 1990-1999  and a decadal trend of 0.14 PgC yr-1 per decade for 1990-2009 . Therefore, although the ocean models do not reproduce all the details of the regional structure and changes in air-sea CO2 fluxes, their globally integrated ocean CO2 sink and decadal rate of change of this sink is in good agreement with the available observations. Sensitivity of modelled air-sea fluxes to climate. The relationship between air-sea CO2 flux and climate is strongly dependent on the oceanic region and on the time scale. Ocean carbon cycle models of the type used in AR5 estimate a reduction in cumulative ocean CO2 uptake of 1.6 to 5.4 PgC over the period 1959-2008  in response to climate change and variability compared to simulations with no changes in climate , partly due to changes in the equatorial Pacific and to changes in the Southern Ocean. The only observation-based estimate available to evaluate the climate response of the global air-sea CO2 flux is from Park et al. , which is at the low end of the model estimate for the past two decades . However, this estimate does not include the nonlinear effects of changes in ocean circulation and warming on the global air-sea CO2 flux, which could amplify the response of the ocean CO2 sink to climate by 20 to 30% . Processes missing in ocean models. The most important processes missing in ocean carbon cycle models used in the AR5 are those representing explicitly small-scale physical circulation , which are parameterised in models. These processes have an important influence on the vertical transport of water, heat, salt and carbon . In particular, changes in vertical transport in the Southern Ocean are thought to explain part of the changes in atmospheric CO2 between glacial and interglacial conditions, a signal that is not entirely reproduced by models  suggesting that the sensitivity of ocean models could be underestimated. Processes related to marine ecosystems in global ocean models are also limited to the simulation of lower trophic levels, with crude parameterizations for sinking processes, bacterial and other loss processes at the surface and in the ocean interior and their temperature dependence . Projected changes in carbon fluxes from the response of marine ecosystems to changes in temperature , ocean acidification   and pressure from fisheries  are all considered potentially important, though not yet quantified. Several processes have been specifically identified that could lead to changes in the ocean CO2 sink, in particular the temperature effects on marine ecosystem processes  and the variable nutrient ratios induced by ocean acidification or ecosystem changes . Coastal ocean processes are also poorly represented in global and may influence the ocean CO2 sink. Nevertheless, the fit of ocean model results to the integrated CO2 sink and decadal trends discussed above suggest that, up to now, the missing processes have not had a dominant effect on ocean CO2 beyond the limits of the uncertainty of the data.	0
The residual land CO2 sink, that is, the uptake of CO2 in ecosystems excluding the effects of land use change, is 1.5  1.1, 2.6  1.2 and 2.6  1.2 PgC yr-1 for the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, respectively . After including the net land use change emissions, the atmosphereto-land flux of CO2  corresponds to a net sink of CO2 by all terrestrial ecosystems. This sink has intensified globally from a neutral CO2 flux of 0.1  0.8 PgC yr-1 in the 1980s to a net CO2 sink of 1.1  0.9 PgC yr-1 and 1.5  0.9 PgC yr-1 during the 1990s and 2000s, respectively . This growing land sink is also supported by an atmospheric inversion  and by process-based models . 6.3.2.6.2	0
The results from atmospheric CO2 inversions, terrestrial ecosystem models and forest inventories consistently show that there is a large net CO2 sink in the northern extratropics, albeit the very limited availability of observations in the tropics . Inversion estimates of atmosphere-land CO2 fluxes show net atmosphere-to-land CO2 flux estimates ranging from neutral to a net source of 0.5 to 1.0 PgC yr-1  . However, Stephens et al.  selected from an ensemble of inversion models those that were consistent with independent aircraft cross-validation data, and constrained an atmosphere-to-land CO2 flux of 0.1  0.8 PgC yr-1 during the period 1992-1996, and a NH net CO2 sink of 1.5  0.6 PgC yr-1. These results shows that after subtracting emissions from land use change, tropical land ecosystems might also be large CO2 sinks. Based on repeated forest biomass inventory data, estimated soil carbon changes, and CO2 emissions from land use change from the bookkeeping method of Houghton et al. , Pan et al.  estimated a global forest carbon accumulation of 0.5  0.1 PgCyr-1 in boreal forests, and of 0.8  0.1 PgC yr-1 in temperate forests for the period 2000-2007. Tropical forests were found to be near neutral with net emissions from land use change being compensated by sinks in established tropical forests , therefore consistent with the Stephens et al.  inversion estimate of tropical atmosphere-land CO2 fluxes. Since AR4, a number of studies have compared and attempted to reconcile regional atmosphere-to-land CO2 flux estimates from multiple approaches and so providing further spatial resolution of the regional contributions of carbon sources and sinks . A synthesis of regional contributions estimated a 1.7 PgC yr-1 sink in the NH regions above 20N with consistent estimates from terrestrial models and inventories  and atmospheric CO2 inversions  .	0
The interannual variability of the residual land sink shown in Figures 6.12 and 6.16 accounts for most of the interannual variability of the atmospheric CO2 growth rate . Atmospheric CO2 inversion results suggest that tropical land ecosystems dominate the global CO2 variability, with positive anomalies during El Nino episodes , which is consistent with the results of one inversion of atmospheric 13C and CO2 measurements . A combined El Nino-Southern Oscillation -Volcanic index time series explains 75% of the observed variability . A positive phase of ENSO  is generally associated with enhanced land CO2 source, and a negative phase  with enhanced land CO2 sink . Observations from eddy covariance networks suggest that interannual carbon flux variability in the tropics and temperate regions is dominated by precipitation, while boreal ecosystem fluxes are more sensitive to temperature and shortwave radiation variation , in agreement with the results from process-based terrestrial ecosystem models . Terrestrial biogeochemical models suggest that interannual net biome productivity  variability is dominated by GPP  rather than terrestrial ecosystem respiration . 6.3.2.6.4	0
Global analyses estimate that inland waters receive about 1.7 to 2.7 PgC yr-1 emitted by soils to rivers headstreams, of which, 0.2 to 0.6 PgC yr-1 is buried in aquatic sediments, 0.8 to 1.2 PgC yr-1 returns to the atmosphere as CO2, and 0.9 PgC yr-1 is delivered to the ocean . Estimates of the transport of carbon from land ecosystems to the coastal ocean by rivers are ~0.2 PgC yr-1 for Dissolved Organic Carbon , 0.3 PgC yr-1 for Dissolved Inorganic Carbon , and 0.1 to 0.4 PgC yr-1 for Particulate Organic Carbon  . For the DIC fluxes, only about twothirds of it originates from atmospheric CO2 and the rest of the carbon is supplied by weathered carbonate rocks .	0
Regional DIC concentrations in rivers has increased during the Industrial Era . Agricultural practices coupled with climate change can lead to large increases in regional scale DIC export in watersheds with a large agricultural footprint . Furthermore, regional urbanization also elevates DIC fluxes in rivers , which suggests that anthropogenic activities have contributed a significant portion of the annual global river DIC flux to the ocean. Land clearing and management are thought to produce an acceleration of POC transport, much of which is trapped in alluvial and colluvial deposition zones, lakes, reservoirs and wetlands . Numerous studies have demonstrated an increase in the concentration of DOC in rivers in the northeastern United States and northern/central Europe over the past two to four decades . Owing to the important role of wetlands in DOC production, the mobilization of DOC due to human-induced changes in wetlands probably represents an important cause of changes in global river DOC fluxes to date , although a global estimate of this alteration is not available. A robust partitioning between natural and anthropogenic carbon fluxes in freshwater systems is not yet possible, nor a quantification of the ultimate fate of carbon delivered by rivers to the coastal and open oceans. 6.3.2.6.5	0
Box 6.3 | The Carbon Dioxide Fertilisation Effect Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations lead to higher leaf photosynthesis and reduced canopy transpiration, which in turn lead to increased plant water use efficiency and reduced fluxes of surface latent heat. The increase in leaf photosynthesis with rising CO2, the so-called CO2 fertilisation effect, plays a dominant role in terrestrial biogeochemical models to explain the global land carbon sink , yet it is one of most unconstrained process in those models. Field experiments provide a direct evidence of increased photosynthesis rates and water use efficiency  in plants growing under elevated CO2. These physiological changes translate into a broad range of higher plant carbon accumulation in more than two-thirds of the experiments and with increased net primary productivity  of about 20 to 25% at double CO2 from pre-industrial concentrations . Since the AR4, new evidence is available from long-term Free-air CO2 Enrichment  experiments in temperate ecosystems showing the capacity of ecosystems exposed to elevated CO2 to sustain higher rates of carbon accumulation over multiple years . However, FACE experiments also show the diminishing or lack of CO2 fertilisation effect in some ecosystems and for some plant species . This lack of response occurs despite increased water use efficiency, also confirmed with tree ring evidence . Nutrient limitation is hypothesized as primary cause for reduced or lack of CO2 fertilisation effect observed on NPP in some experiments . Nitrogen and phosphorus are very likely to play the most important role in this limitation of the CO2 fertilisation effect on NPP, with nitrogen limitation prevalent in temperate and boreal ecosystems, and phosphorus limitation in the tropics . Micronutrients interact in diverse ways with other nutrients in constraining NPP such as molybdenum and phosphorus in the tropics . Thus, with high confidence, the CO2 fertilisation effect will lead to enhanced NPP, but significant uncertainties remain on the magnitude of this effect, given the lack of experiments outside of temperate climates.	0
Process attribution of the global land CO2 sink is difficult due to limited availability of global data sets and biogeochemical models that include all major processes. However, regional studies shed light on key drivers and their interactions. The European and North American carbon sinks are explained by the combination of forest regrowth in abandoned lands and decreased forest harvest along with the fertilisation effects of rising CO2 and nitrogen deposition . In the tropics, there is evidence from forest inventories that increasing forest growth rates are not explained by the natural recovery from disturbances, suggesting that increasing atmospheric CO2 and climate change play a role in the observed sink in established forests . There is also recent evidence of tropical nitrogen deposition becoming more notable although its effects on the net carbon balance have not been assessed . The land carbon cycle is very sensitive to climate changes , and thus the changes in the physical climate from increasing GHGs as well as in the diffuse fraction of sunlight are likely to be causing significant changes in the carbon cycle (Jones et al., 2001; Friedlingstein et al., 2006; Mercado et 502	0
al., 2009). Changes in the climate are also associated with disturbances such as fires, insect damage, storms, droughts and heat waves which are already significant processes of interannual variability and possibly trends of regional land carbon fluxes  . Warming  has also been correlated with global trends in satellite greenness observations, which resulted in an estimated 6% increase of global NPP, or the accumulation of 3.4 PgC on land over the period 1982-1999 . This enhanced NPP was attributed to the relaxation of climatic constraints to plant growth, particularly in high latitudes. Concomitant to the increased of NPP with warming, global soil respiration also increased between 1989 and 2008 , reducing the magnitude of the net land sink. A recent study suggests a declining NPP trend over 2000-2009  although the model used to reconstruct NPP trends from satellite observation has not been widely accepted . 6.3.2.6.6	0
fluxes and carbon storage change at particular sites around the world, in particular sites from the Fluxnet global network ,  observed spatio-temporal change in leaf area index   and  interannual and seasonal change in atmospheric CO2 . Figure 6.16 compares the global land CO2 sink driven by climate change and rising CO2 as simulated by different process based carbon cycle models , with the residual land sink computed as the sum of fossil fuel and cement emissions and land use change emissions minus the sum of CO2 growth rate and ocean sink . Although these two quantities are not the same, the multi-model mean reproduces well the trend and interannual variability of the residual land sink which is dominated by climate variability and climate trends and CO2, respectively, both represented in models . Limited availability of in situ measurements, particularly in the tropics, limits the progress towards reducing uncertainty on model parameterizations. Regional and local measurements can be used to evaluate and improve global models. Regionally, forest inventory data show that the forest carbon sink density over Europe is of -89  19 gC m-2 yr-1, which	0
is compatible with model estimates with afforestation , while modelled NPP was 43% larger than the inventory estimate. In North America, the ability of 22 terrestrial carbon cycle models to simulate the seasonal cycle of land-atmosphere CO2 exchange from 44 eddy covariance flux towers was poor with a difference between observations and simulations of 10 times the observational uncertainty . Model shortcomings included spring phenology, soil thaw, snow pack melting and lag responses to extreme climate events . In China, the magnitude of the carbon sink estimated by five terrestrial ecosystem models  was comparable to the observation-based estimate , but modelled interannual variation was weakly correlated to observed regional land-atmosphere CO2 fluxes . Sensitivity of the terrestrial carbon cycle to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide. An inter-comparison of 10 process-based models showed increased NPP by 3% to 10% over the last three decades, during which CO2 increased by ~50 ppm . These results are consistent within the broad range of responses from experimental studies . However, Hickler et al.  suggested that currently available FACE results  are not applicable to vegetation globally because there may be large spatial heterogeneity in vegetation responses to CO2 fertilisation.	0

Figure 6.16 | The black line and gray shading represent the estimated value of the residual land sink  and its uncertainty from Table 6.1, which is calculated from the difference between emissions from fossil fuel and land use change plus emissions from net land use change, minus the atmospheric growth rate and the ocean sink. The atmosphereto-land flux simulated by process land ecosystem models from Table 6.7 are shown in thin green, and their average in thick green. A positive atmosphere-to-land flux represents a sink of CO2. The definition of the atmosphere-to-land flux simulated by these models is close to but not identical to the residual land sink from Table 6.1 .	0
Sensitivity of terrestrial carbon cycle to climate trends and v ariability. Warming exerts a direct control on the net land-atmosphere CO2 exchange because both photosynthesis and respiration are sensitive to changes in temperature. From estimates of interannual variations in the residual land sink, 1C of positive global temperature anomaly leads to a decrease of 4 PgC yr-1 of the global land CO2 sink . This observed interannual response is close to the response of the models listed in Table 6.7 , albeit individual models show a range going from -0.5 to -6.2 PgC yr-1 C-1. The sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 concentration to century scale temperature change was estimated at about 3.6 to 45.6 PgC C-1  using the ice core observed CO2 drop during the Little Ice Age .	0
Terrestrial carbon cycle models used in AR5 generally underestimate GPP in the water limited regions, implying that these models do not correctly simulate soil moisture conditions, or that they are too sensitive to changes in soil moisture . Most models  estimated that the interannual precipitation sensitivity of the global land CO2 sink to be higher than that of the observed residual land sink . Processes missing in terrestrial carbon cycle models. First, many models do not explicitly take into account the various forms of disturbances or ecosystem dynamics: migration, fire, logging, harvesting, insect 504	0
outbreaks and the resulting variation in forest age structure which is known to affect the net carbon exchange . Second, many key processes relevant to decomposition of carbon are missing in models , and particularly for permafrost carbon and for carbon in boreal and tropical wetlands and peatlands, despite the large amount of carbon stored in these ecosystems and their vulnerability to warming and land use change . However, progress has been made . Third, nutrient dynamics are taken into account only by few models despite the fact it is well established that nutrient constrains NPP and nitrogen deposition enhances NPP ; see Section 6.3.2.6.5. Very few models have phosphorus dynamics . Fourth, the negative effects of elevated tropospheric ozone on NPP have not been taken into account by most current carbon cycle models . Fifth, transfer of radiation, water and heat in the vegetation-soil-atmosphere continuum are treated very simply in the global ecosystem models. Finally, processes that transport carbon at the surface  and human managements including fertilisation and irrigation  are poorly or not represented at all. Broadly, models are still at their early stages in dealing with land use, land use change and forestry.	0

AR5 is the first IPCC assessment report providing a consistent synthesis of the CH4 budget per decade using multiple atmospheric CH4 inversion models  and process-based models and inventories . Table 6.8 shows the budgets for the decades of 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Uncertainties on emissions and sinks are listed using minimum and maximum of each published estimate for each decade. Bottom-up approaches are used to attribute decadal budgets to individual processes emitting CH4 . Top-down inversions provide an atmospheric-based constraint mostly for the total CH4 source per region, and the use of additional observations  allows inferring emissions per source type. Estimates of CH4 sinks in the troposphere by reaction with tropospheric OH, in soils and in the stratosphere are also presented. Despite significant progress since the AR4, large uncertainties remain in the present knowledge of the budget and its evolution over time.	0
CH4 is currently measured by a network of more than 100 surface sites , aircraft profiles , satellite  and before 1979 from analyses of firn air and ice cores . The growth of CH4 in the atmosphere is largely in response to increasing anthropogenic emissions. The vertically averaged atmospheric CH4 concentration field can be mapped by remote sensing from the surface using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy  instruments , Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer , Scanning Imaging Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography , and Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite-Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation Fourier-Transform Spectrometer . As an example, SCIAMACHY shows the column CH4 gradient between the two hemispheres as well as increased concentrations over Southeast Asia, due to emissions from agriculture, wetlands, waste and 505	0
energy production . In situ observations provide very precise measurements  but unevenly located at the surface of the globe. Satellite data offer a global coverage at the cost of a lower precision on individual measurements  and possible biases . The growth rate of CH4 has declined since the mid-1980s, and a near zero growth rate  was observed during 1999-2006, suggesting an approach to steady state where the sum of emissions are in balance with the sum of sinks . The reasons for this growth rate decline after the mid-1980s are still debated, and results from various studies provide possible scenarios:  a reduction of anthropogenic emitting activities such as coal mining, gas industry and/or animal husbandry, especially in the countries of the former Soviet Union ;  a compensation between increasing anthropogenic emissions and decreasing wetland	0
emissions ;  significant  to small  changes in OH concentrations and/or based on two different 13CH4 data sets;  reduced emissions from rice paddies attributed to changes in agricultural practices ; or  stable microbial and fossil fuel emissions from 1990 to 2005 . Since 2007, atmospheric CH4 has been observed to increase again  with positive anomalies of emissions of 21 Tg yr-1 and 18 Tg yr-1 estimated by inversions during 2007 and 2008, respectively  as compared to the 1999-2006 period. The increase of emissions in 2007-2008 was dominated by tropical regions , with a major contribution from tropical wetlands and some contribution from high-latitude wetlands during the 2007 anomaly . This increase is suggested by the growth rate over latitude in Figure 6.18 . The recent increase of CH4 concentration since 2007 is also consistent	0

6.3.3.2 Methane Emissions \The CH4 growth rate results from the balance between emissions and sinks. Methane emissions around the globe are biogenic, thermogenic or pyrogenic in origin , and they can be the direct result of either human activities and/or natural processes . Biogenic sources are due to degradation of organic matter in anaerobic conditions . Thermogenic sources come from the slow transformation of organic matter into fossil fuels on geological time scales . Pyrogenic sources are due to incomplete combustion of organic matter . Some sources can eventually combine a biogenic and a thermogenic origin . Each of these three types of emissions is characterized by ranges in its isotopic composition in13CCH4: typically -55 to -70 for biogenic, -25 to -45 for thermogenic, and -13 to -25 for pyrogenic. These isotopic distinctions provide a basis for attempting to separate the relative contribution of different methane sources using the top-down approach .	0
During the decade of the 2000s, natural sources of CH4 account for 35 to 50% of the decadal mean global emissions . The single most dominant CH4 source of the global flux and interannual variability is CH4 emissions from wetlands  yr-1). With high confidence, climate driven changes of emissions from wetlands are the main drivers of the global inter-annual variability of CH4 emissions. The term `wetlands' denotes here a variety of ecosystems emitting CH4 in the tropics and the high latitudes: wet soils, swamps, bogs and peatlands. These emissions are highly sensitive to climate change and variability, as shown, for instance, from the high CH4 growth rate in 2007-2008 that coincides with positive precipitation and temperature anomalies . Several process-based models of methane emissions from wetlands have been developed and improved since AR4 , yet the confidence in modeled wetland CH4 emissions remains low, particularly because of limited observational data sets available for model calibration and evaluation. Spatial distribution and temporal variability of wetlands also remains highly 508	0
unconstrained in spite the existence of some remote sensing products . It has been observed that wetland CH4 emissions increase in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations . van Groenigen et al. attribute such an increase in CH4 emissions from natural wetlands to increasing soil moisture due to the reduced plant demand for water under higher CO2. However, the sign and magnitude of the CH4 emission response to changes in temperature and precipitation vary among models but show, on average, a decrease of wetland area and CH4 flux with increasing temperature, especially in the tropics, and a modest  increase of wetland area and CH4 flux with increasing precipitation . In AR4, natural geological sources were estimated between 4 and 19 Tg yr-1. Since then, Etiope et al.  provided improved emission estimates from terrestrial  yr-1) and marine  yr-1) seepages, mud volcanoes  yr-1), hydrates  yr-1) and geothermal and volcanic areas  yr-1), which represent altogether between 42 and 64 Tg yr-1 . This contribution from natural, geological and partly fossil CH4 is larger than in AR4 and consistent with a 14CH4 reanalysis showing natural and anthropogenic fossil contributions to the global CH4 budget to be around 30%   and not around 20% as previously estimated . However, such a large percentage was not confirmed by an analysis of the global atmospheric record of ethane  which is co-emitted with geological CH4. Of the natural sources of CH4, emissions from thawing permafrost and CH4 hydrates in the northern circumpolar region will become potentially important in the 21st century because they could increase dramatically due to the rapid climate warming of the Arctic and the large carbon pools stored there  . Hydrates are, however, estimated to represent only a very small emission, between 2 and 9 Tg yr-1 under the current time period . Supersaturation of dissolved CH4 at the bottom and surface waters in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf indicate some CH4 activity across the region, with a net sea-air flux of 10.5 Tg yr-1 which is similar in magnitude to the flux for the entire ocean  but it is not possible to say whether this source has always been present or is a consequence of recent Arctic changes. The ebullition of CH4 from decomposing, thawing lake sediments in north Siberia with an estimated flux of ~4 Tg yr-1 is another demonstration of the activity of this region and of its potential importance in the future . The sum of all natural emission estimates other than wetlands is still very uncertain based on bottom-up studies  yr-1 for 2000-2009].	0
Pyrogenic sources of CH4  are assessed to have a small contribution in the global flux for the 2000s  yr-1). Biomass burning of tropical and boreal forests  yr-1) play a much smaller role than wetlands in interannual variability of emissions, except during intensive fire periods . Only during the 1997-1998 record strong El Nino, burning of forests and peatland that took place in Indonesia and Malaysia, released ~12 Tg and contributed to the observed growth rate anomaly . Other smaller fire CH4 emissions positive anomalies were suggested over the northern mid-latitudes in 2002-2003, in particular over Eastern Siberia in 2003  and Russia in 2010. Traditional biofuel burning is estimated to be a source of 14 to 17 Tg yr-1. Keppler at al.  reported that plants under aerobic conditions were able to emit CH4, and thus potentially could constitute a large additional emission, which had not been previously considered in the global CH4 budget. Later studies do not support plant emissions as a widespread mechanism  or show small to negligible emissions in the context of the global CH4 budget . Alternative mechanisms have been suggested to explain an apparent aerobic CH4 production, which involve  adsorption and desorption ,  degradation of organic matter under strong ultraviolet  light  and  methane in the groundwater emitted through internal air spaces in tree bodies . Overall, a significant emission of CH4 by plants under aerobic conditions is very unlikely, and this source is not reported in Table 6.8. Anthropogenic CH4 sources are estimated to range between 50% and 65% of the global emissions for the 2000s . They include rice paddies agriculture, ruminant animals, sewage and waste, landfills, and fossil fuel extraction, storage, transformation, transportation and use . Anthropogenic sources are dominant over natural sources in top-down inversions  but they are of the same magnitude in bottom-up models and inventories . Rice paddies emit between 33 to 40 Tg yr-1 and 90% of these emissions come from tropical Asia, with more than 50% from China and India . Ruminant livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats, etc. produce CH4 by food fermentation in their anoxic rumens with a total estimate of between 87 and 94 Tg yr-1. Major regional contributions of this flux come from India, China, Brazil and the USA , EDGAR v4.2. India, with the world's largest livestock population emitted 11.8 Tg yr-1 in 2003, including emission from enteric fermentation  yr-1) and manure management  yr-1; Chhabra et al., 2013). Methanogenesis in landfills, livestock manure and waste waters produces between 67 and 90 Tg yr-1 due to anoxic conditions and a high availability of acetate, CO2 and H2. Loss of natural gas  is the largest contributor to fossil fuel related fugitive emissions, estimated between 85 and 105 Tg yr-1 in the USA , EDGAR v4.2.	0
6.3.3.3 Sinks of Atmospheric Methane The main sink of atmospheric CH4 is its oxidation by OH radicals, a chemical reaction that takes place mostly in the troposphere and stratosphere . OH removes each year an amount of CH4 equivalent to 90% of all surface emissions , that is, 9% of the total burden of CH4 in the atmosphere, which defines a partial atmospheric lifetime with respect to OH of 7 to 11 years for an atmospheric burden of 4800 Tg  atmospheric chemistry models in Voulgarakis et al. , thus slightly different from Figure 6.2; see Section 8.2.3.3 for ACCMIP models). A recent estimate of the CH4 lifetime is 9.1  0.9 years . A small sink of atmospheric CH4 is suspected, but still debated, in the marine boundary layer due to a chemical reaction with chlorine . Another small sink is the reaction of CH4 with Cl radicals and O in the stratosphere . Finally, oxidation in upland soils  by methanotrophic bacterias removes about 9 to 47 Tg yr-1 . There have been a number of published estimates of global OH concentrations and variations over the past decade . The very short lifetime of OH makes it almost impossible to measure directly global OH concentrations in the atmosphere. Chemistry transport models , chemistry climate models  or proxy methods have to be used to obtain a global mean value and time variations. For the 2000s, CTMs and CCMs  estimate a global chemical loss of methane due to OH of 604 Tg yr-1  yr-1). This loss is larger, albeit compatible considering the large uncertainties, with a recent extensive analysis by Prather et al.  inferring a global chemical loss of 554  56 Tg yr-1. Top-down inversions using methyl-chloroform  measurements to infer OH provide a smaller chemical loss of 518 Tg yr-1 with a more narrow range of 510 to 538 Tg yr-1 in the 2000s. However, inversion estimates probably do not account for all sources of uncertainties . CCMs and CTMs simulate small interannual variations of OH radicals, typically of 1 to 3%  due to a high buffering of this radical by atmospheric photochemical reactions . Atmospheric inversions show much larger variations for the 1980s and the 1990s , because of their oversensitivity to uncertainties on MCF emissions, when measurements of this tracer are used to reconstruct OH , although reduced variations are inferred after 1998 by Prinn et al. . For the 2000s, the reduction of MCF in the atmosphere, due to the Montreal protocol  and its further amendments, allows a consistent estimate of small OH variations between atmospheric inversions  and CCMs/CTMs . However, the very low atmospheric values reached by MCF  impose the need to find another tracer to reconstruct global OH in the upcoming years. Finally, evidence for the role of changes in OH concentrations in explaining the increase in atmospheric methane since 2007 is variable, ranging from a significant contribution  to only a small role . 509	0
6.3.3.4 Global Methane Budget for the 2000s Based on the inversion of atmospheric measurements of CH4 from surface stations, global CH4 emissions for the 2000s are of 553 Tg yr-1, with a range of 526 to 569 Tg yr-1 . The total loss of atmospheric methane is of 550 Tg yr-1 with a range of 514 to 560 Tg yr-1, determining a small imbalance of about 3 Tg yr-1, in line with the small growth rate of 6 Tg yr-1 observed for the 2000s. Based on bottom-up models and inventories, a larger global CH4 emissions of 678 Tg yr-1 are found, mostly because of the still debated upward re-evaluation of geological  and freshwater  emission sources. An averaged total loss of 632 Tg yr-1 is found, by an ensemble of Atmospheric Chemistry models  leading to an imbalance of about 45 Tg yr-1 during the 2000s, as compared to the observed mean growth rate of 6 Tg yr-1. There is no constraint that applies to the sum of emissions in the bottom-up approach, unlike for top-down inversions when these have constrained OH fields . Therefore, top-down inversions can help constrain global CH4 emissions in the global budget, although they do not resolve the same level of detail in the mix of sources than the bottom-up approaches, and thus provide more limited information about processes .	0
The atmospheric abundance of N2O has been increasing mainly as a result of agricultural intensification to meet the food demand for a growing human population. Use of synthetic fertiliser  and manure applications increase the production of N2O in soils and sediments, via nitrification and denitrification pathways, leading to increased N2O emissions to the atmosphere. Increased emissions occur not only in agricultural fields, but also in aquatic systems after nitrogen leaching and runoff, and in natural soils and ocean surface waters as a result of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen originating from agriculture, fossil fuel combustion and industrial activities. Food production is likely responsible for 80% of the increase in atmospheric N2O , via the addition of nitrogen fertilisers. Global emissions of N2O are difficult to estimate owing to heterogeneity in space and time. Table 6.9 presents global emissions based on upscaling of local flux measurements at the surface. Modelling of the atmospheric lifetime of N2O and atmospheric inversions constrain global and regional N2O budgets , although there is uncertainty in these estimates because of uncertainty in the dominant loss term of N2O, that is, the destruction of N2O by photolysis and reaction with O in the stratosphere. The long atmospheric lifetime of N2O  implies that it will take more than a century before atmospheric abundances stabilise after the stabilization of global emissions. This is of concern not only because of its contribution to the radiative forcing , but also because of the relative importance of N2O and other GHGs in affecting the ozone layer . 510	0
Since AR4 , a number of studies allow us to update some of the N2O emission estimates. First and most importantly, the IPCC Guidelines were revised in 2006  and in particular emission factors for estimating agricultural N2O emissions. Applying these 2006 emission factors to global agricultural statistics results in higher direct emissions from agriculture  than in AR4, but into indirect emissions  that are considerably lower than reported in AR4 . It should be noted that emissions of N2O show large uncertainties when default emission factors are applied at the global scale . Second, estimates of the anthropogenic source of N2O from the open ocean have been made for the first time. These emissions result from atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic Nr  . This anthropogenic ocean N2O source was implicitly included as part of the natural ocean N2O source in AR4, but is now given as a separate anthropogenic source of 0.2  TgN yr-1 in Table 6.9. Finally, a first estimate of global N2O uptake at the surface is now available , based on reviews of measurements of N2O uptake in soils and sediments . The uncertainty in this sink of N2O is large. On the global scale, this surface sink is negligible, but at the local scale it may not be irrelevant.	0
6.3.4.1 Atmosphere Nitrous Oxide Burden and Growth Rate The concentration of N2O is currently 20% higher than pre-industrial levels . Figure 6.19 shows the annual growth rate of atmospheric N2O estimated from direct measurements  network of surface stations). On decadal time scales, the concentration of N2O has been increasing at a rate of 0.73  0.03 ppb yr-1. The interannual variability in mid- to high-latitude N2O abundance in both the NH and SH was found to correlate with the strength of the stratospheric Brewer-Dobson circulation . Variability in stratosphere to troposphere air mass exchange, coupled with the stratospheric N2O sink is likely to be responsible for a fraction of the interannual variability in tropospheric N2O, but the understanding of this process is poor . This removal process signal is obscured in the SH by the timing of oceanic thermal and biological ventilation signals  and terrestrial sources . These two factors may thus also be important determinants of seasonal and interannual variability of N2O in the atmosphere. Quantitative understanding of terrestrial N2O emissions variability is poor, although emissions are known to be sensitive to soil water content . A first process model-based estimate suggests that the mainly climate-driven variability in the terrestrial source may account for only 0.07 ppb yr-1 variability in atmospheric N2O growth rate, which would be difficult to detect in the observed growth rate . Most N2O is produced by biological  processes such as nitrification and denitrification in terrestrial and aquatic systems, including rivers, estuaries, coastal seas and the open ocean . In general, more N2O is formed when more reactive nitrogen	0
Table 6.9 does not include the formation of atmospheric N2O from abiotic decomposition of ammonium nitrate in the presence of light, appropriate relative humidity and a surface. This process recently has been proposed as a potentially important source of N2O ; however, a global estimate does not yet exist. Table 6.9 indicates that the global N2O emissions in the mid-1990s amount to 17.5  TgN  yr-1. The uncertainty range is consistent with that of atmospheric inversions studies  by Huang et al. . The estimates of anthropogenic N2O emissions of Table 6.9 are in line with the top-down estimates by Prather et al.  of 6.5  1.3 TgN  yr-1, and somewhat higher than their estimates for	0

Overall, anthropogenic N2O emissions are now a factor of 8 greater than their estimated level in 1900. These trends are consistent with observed increases in atmospheric N2O .

response to long-term climate variations are difficult to estimate . Simulations by terrestrial biosphere models suggest a moderate increase of global N2O emissions with recent climate changes, related mainly to changes in land temperature , thus suggesting a possible positive feedback to the climate system. Nonetheless, the recent change in atmospheric N2O is largely dominated to anthropogenic reactive nitrogen  and industrial emissions . Stocker et al.  have found, using a global coupled model of climate and biogeochemical cycles, that future climate change will amplify terrestrial N2O emissions resulting from anthropogenic Nr additions, consistent with empirical understanding . This result suggests that the use of constant emission factors might underestimate future N2O emission trajectories. Significant uncertainty remains in the N2O-climate feedback from land ecosystems, given the poorly known response of emission processes to the changes in seasonal and	0

N2O production will be affected by climate change through the effects on the microbial nitrification and denitrification processes . Warming experiments tend to show enhanced N2O emission . Elevated CO2 predominantly increases N2O emissions; however, reductions have also been observed , induced by changes in soil moisture, plant productivity and nitrogen uptake, as well as activity and composition of soil microbial and fungal communities .

6.3.4.3 Global Nitrogen Budget For base year 2010, anthropogenic activities created ~210  TgN of reactive nitrogen Nr from N2. This human-caused creation of reactive nitrogen in 2010 is at least 2 times larger than the rate of natural terrestrial creation of ~58 TgN  . Note that the estimate of natural terrestrial biological fixation  is lower than former estimates , but the ranges overlap, 50 to 100 TgN yr-1, vs. 90 to 120 TgN yr-1, respectively). Of this created reactive nitrogen, NOx and NH3 emissions from anthropogenic sources are about fourfold greater than natural emissions . A greater portion of the NH3 emissions is deposited to the continents rather than to the oceans, relative to the deposition of NOy, due to the longer atmospheric residence time of the latter. These deposition estimates are lower limits, as they do not include organic nitrogen species. New model and measurement information  suggests that incomplete inclusion of emissions and atmospheric chemistry of reduced and oxidized organic nitrogen components in current models may lead to systematic underestimates of total global reactive nitrogen deposition by up to 35% . Discharge of reactive nitrogen to the coastal oceans is ~45 TgN yr-1 . Denitrification converts Nr back to atmospheric N2. The current estimate for the production of atmospheric N2 is 110 TgN yr-1 . Thus of the ~280 TgN yr-1 of Nr from anthropogenic and natural sources, ~40% gets converted to N2 each year. The remaining 60% is stored in terrestrial ecosystems, transported by rivers and by atmospheric transport and deposition to the ocean, or emitted as N2O . For the oceans, denitrification producing atmospheric N2 is 200 to 400 TgN yr-1, which is larger than the current uptake of atmospheric N2 by ocean biological fixation of 140 to 177 TgN yr-1 .	0
In this section, we assess coupled model projections of changes in the evolution of CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes, and hence the role of carbon and other biogeochemical cycles in future climate under socioeconomic emission scenarios . AR4 reported how climate change can affect the natural carbon cycle in a way that could feed back onto climate itself. A comparison of 11 coupled climate-carbon cycle models of different complexity ; Friedlingstein et al., 2006) showed that all 11 models simulated a positive feedback. There is substantial quantitative uncertainty in future CO2 and temperature, both across 514	0
Other biogeochemical cycles and feedbacks play an important role in the future of the climate system, although the carbon cycle represents the strongest of these. Natural CH4 emissions from wetland and fires are sensitive to climate change . The fertilising effects of nitrogen deposition and rising CO2 also affect CH4 emissions by wetlands through increased plant productivity . Changes in the nitrogen cycle, in addition to interactions with CO2 sources and sinks, are very likely to affect the emissions of N2O both on land and from the ocean  and potentially on the rate of CH4 oxidation . A recent review highlighted the complexity of terrestrial biogeochemical feedbacks on climate change  and used the methodology of Gregory et al.  to express their magnitude in common units of W m-2 C-1 . A similar degree of complexity exists in the ocean and in interactions between land, atmosphere and ocean cycles. Many of these processes are not yet represented in coupled climate-biogeochemistry models. Leuzinger et al.  observed a trend from manipulation experiments for higher-order interactions between feedbacks to reduce the magnitude of response. Confidence in the magnitude, and sometimes even the sign, of many of these feedbacks between climate and carbon and other biogeochemical cycles is low. The response of land and ocean carbon storage to changes in climate, atmospheric CO2 and other anthropogenic activities  varies strongly on different time scales. This chapter has assessed carbon cycle changes across many time scales from millennial  to interannual and seasonal , and these are summarized in Table 6.10. A common result is that an increase in atmospheric CO2 will always lead to an increase in land and ocean carbon storage, all other things being held constant. Cox et al.  find an empirical relationship between short-term interannual variability and long-term land tropical carbon cycle sensitivity that may offer an observational constraint on the climate-carbon cycle response over the next century. Generally, however, changes in climate on different time scales do not lead to a consistent sign and magnitude of the response in carbon storage change owing to the many different mechanisms that operate. Thus, changes in carbon cycling on one time scale cannot be extrapolated to make projections on different time scales, but can provide valuable information on the processes at work and can be used to evaluate and improve models.	0
The climate-carbon response  determines changes in carbon storage due to changes in climate, and the concentration-carbon response  determines changes in storage due to elevated CO2. Climate-carbon cycle feedback responses have been analyzed for eight CMIP5 ESMs that performed idealised simulations involving atmospheric CO2 increasing at a prescribed rate of 1% yr-1 . There is high confidence that increased atmospheric CO2 will lead to increased land and ocean carbon uptake but by an uncertain amount. Models agree on the sign of land and ocean response to rising CO2 but show only medium and low agreement for the magnitude of ocean and land carbon uptake respectively . Future climate change will decrease land and ocean carbon uptake compared to the case with constant climate . Models agree on the sign, globally, of land and ocean response to climate change but show low agreement on the magnitude of this response, especially for the land.	0
Land and ocean carbon uptake may differ in sign between different regions and between models . Inclusion of nitrogen cycle processes in two of the land carbon cycle model components out of these eight reduces the magnitude of the sensitivity to both CO2 and climate  and increases the spread across the CMIP5 ensemble. The CMIP5 spread in ocean sensitivity to CO2 and climate appears reduced compared with C4MIP. The role of the idealised experiment presented here is to study model processes and understand what causes the differences between models. Arora et al.  assessed the global carbon budget from these idealised simulations and found that the CO2 contribution to changes in land and ocean carbon storage sensitivity is typically four to five times larger than the sensitivity to climate across the CMIP5 ESMs. The land carbon-climate response  is larger than the ocean carbon-climate	0
Figure 6.20 | A synthesis of the magnitude of biogeochemical feedbacks on climate. Gregory et al.  proposed a framework for expressing non-climate feedbacks in common units  with physical feedbacks, and Arneth et al.  extended this beyond carbon cycle feedbacks to other terrestrial biogeochemical feedbacks. The figure shows the results compiled by Arneth et al. , with ocean carbon feedbacks from the C4MIP coupled climate-carbon models used for AR4 also added. Some further biogeochemical feedbacks are also shown but this list is not exhaustive. Black dots represent single estimates, and coloured bars denote the simple mean of the dots with no weighting or assessment being made to likelihood of any single estimate. There is low confidence in the magnitude of the feedbacks in the lower portion of the figure, especially for those with few, or only one, dot. The role of nitrogen limitation on terrestrial carbon sinks is also shown--this is not a separate feedback, but rather a modulation to the climate-carbon and concentration-carbon feedbacks. These feedback metrics are also to be state or scenario dependent and so cannot always be compared like-for-like .

Box 6.4 | Climate-Carbon Cycle Models and Experimental Design What are coupled climate-carbon cycle models and why do we need them? Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models  have long been used for making climate projections, and have formed the core of previous IPCC climate projection chapters ; see also Chapters 1, 9 and 12). For the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project , many models now have an interactive carbon cycle. What exactly does this mean, how do they work and how does their use differ from previous climate models? AOGCMs typically represent the physical behaviour of the atmosphere and oceans but atmospheric composition, such as the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, is prescribed as an input to the model. This approach neglects the fact that changes in climate might affect the natural biogeochemical cycles, which control atmospheric composition, and so there is a need to represent these processes in climate projections. At the core of coupled climate-carbon cycle models is the physical climate model, but additional components of land and ocean biogeochemistry respond to the changes in the climate conditions to influence in return the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Input to themodels comes in the form of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which can increase the CO2 and then the natural carbon cycle exchanges CO2 between the atmosphere and land and ocean components. These `climate-carbon cycle models'  provide a predictive link between fossil fuel CO2 emissions and future CO2 concentrations and climate and are an important part of the CMIP5 experimental design . Apart from Earth System GCMs, so-called Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity  are often used to perform similar experiments . EMICs have reduced resolution or complexity but run much more quickly and can be used for longer experiments or large ensembles. How are these models used? The capability of ESMs to simulate carbon cycle processes and feedbacks, and in some models other biogeochemical cycles, allows for a greater range of quantities to be simulated such as changes in natural carbon stores, fluxes or ecosystem functioning. There may also be applications where it is desirable for a user to predefine the pathway of atmospheric CO2 and prescribe it as a forcing to the ESMs. Thus, numerical simulations with ESM models can be either `concentration driven' or `emissions driven'. Concentration-driven simulations follow the `traditional' approach of prescribing the time-evolution of atmospheric CO2 as an input to the model. This is shown schematically in Box 6.4 Figure 1 . Atmospheric CO2 concentration is prescribed as input to the model from a given scenario and follows a predefined pathway regardless of changes in the climate or natural carbon cycle processes. The processes between the horizontal dashed lines in the figure represent the model components which are calculated during the concentration-driven simulation. Externally prescribed changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration, which drive climate change, affect land and ocean carbon storage. By construction, changes in land and ocean storage, however, do not feed back on the atmospheric CO2 concentration or on climate. The changes in natural carbon fluxes and stores are output by the model. So-called `compatible fossil fuel emissions', E, can be diagnosed afterwards from mass conservation by calculating the residual between the prescribed CO2 pathway and the natural fluxes: dCO 2  E = dt +  prescribed Land use change emissions cannot be diagnosed separately from a single simulation . Emissions-driven simulations allow the full range of interactions in the models to operate and determine the evolution of atmospheric CO2 and climate as an internal part of the simulation itself . In this case emissions of CO2 are the externally prescribed input to the model and the subsequent changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration are simulated by it.	0
Concentration-driven simulation experiments have the advantage that they can also be performed by GCMs without an interactivecarbon cycle and have been used extensively in previous assessments . For this reason, most of the Representative Concentration Pathway  simulations  presented later in this chapter with carbon cycle models and in Chapter 12 with models that do not all have an interactive carbon cycle are performed this way. Emissions-driven simulations have the advantage of representing the full range of interactions in the coupled climate-carbon cycle models. The RCP8.5 pathway was repeated by many ESM models as an emissions-driven simulation . Feedback Analysis The ESMs are made up of many `components', corresponding to different processes or aspects of the system. To understand their behaviour, techniques have been applied to assess different aspects of the models' sensitivities . The two dominant emerging interactions are the sensitivity of the carbon cycle to changes in CO2 and its sensitivity to changes in climate. These can be measured using two metrics: `beta'  measures the strength of changes in carbon fluxes by land or ocean in response to changes in atmospheric CO2; `gamma'  measures the strength of changes in carbon fluxes by land or ocean in response to changes in climate. These metrics can be calculated as cumulative changes in carbon storage  or instantaneous rates of change .	0
A large positive value of  denotes that a model responds to increasing CO2 by simulating large increases in natural carbon sinks. Negative values of  denote that a model response to climate warming is to reduce CO2 uptake from the atmosphere, while a positive value means warming acts to increase CO2 uptake.  and  values are not specified in a model, but are properties that emerge from the suite of complex processes represented in the model. The values of the  and  metrics diagnosed from simulations can vary from place to place within the same model , although it is the average over the whole globe that determines the global extent of the climate-carbon cycle feedback. Such an idealised analysis framework should be seen as a technique for assessing relative sensitivities of models and understanding their differences, rather than as absolute measures of invariant system properties. By design, these experiments exclude land use change. The complex ESMs have new components and new processes beyond conventional AO GCMs and thus require additional evaluation to assess their ability to make climate projections. Evaluation of the carbon cycle model components of ESMs is presented in Section 6.3.2.5.6 for ocean carbon models and Section 6.3.2.6.6 for land carbon models. Evaluation of the fully coupled ESMs is presented in Chapter 9. Box 6.4, Table 1 | Configurations of simulations designed for feedback analysis by allowing some carbon-climate interactions to operate but holding others constant. The curves denote whether increasing or constant CO2 values are input to the radiation and carbon cycle model components. In a fully coupled simulation, the carbon cycle components of the models experience both changes in atmospheric CO2  and changes in climate. In `biogeochemically' coupled experiments, the atmospheric radiation experiences constant CO2  whereas the carbon cycle model components experience increasing CO2. This experiment quantifies the strength of the effect of rising CO2 concentration alone on the carbon cycle . In a radiatively coupled experiment, the climate model's radiation scheme experiences an increase in the radiative forcing of CO2  but CO2 concentration is kept fixed to pre-industrial value as input to the carbon cycle model components. This simulation quantifies the effect of climate change alone on the carbon cycle .	0
6.4.2.2 Scenario Dependence of Feedbacks The values of carbon-cycle feedback metrics can vary markedly for different scenarios and as such cannot be used to compare model simulations over different time periods, nor to inter-compare model simulations with different scenarios . Gregory et al.  demonstrated how sensitive the feedback metrics are to the rate of change of CO2 for two models: faster rates of CO2 increase lead to reduced  values as the carbon uptake  lags further behind the forcing.  is much less sensitive to the scenario, as both global temperature and carbon uptake lag the forcing.	0
Table 6.10 | Comparison of the sign and magnitude of changes in carbon storage  by land and ocean over different time scales. These changes are shown as approximate numbers to allow a comparison across time scales. For more details see the indicated chapter section. An indication, where known, of what causes these changes  is also given with an indication of the sign: `+' means that an increase in CO2 or global-mean temperature is associated with an increase in carbon storage , and a `-' means an increase in CO2 or global-mean temperature is associated with a decrease in carbon storage . The processes that operate to drive these changes can vary markedly, for example, from seasonal phenology of vegetation to long-term changes in ice sheet cover or ocean circulation impacting carbon reservoirs. Some of these processes are `reversible' in the context that they can increase and decrease cyclically, whereas some are `irreversible' in the context that changes in one sense might be much longer than in the opposite direction.	0

Figure 6.21 | Comparison of carbon cycle feedback metrics between the C4MIP ensemble of seven GCMs and four EMICs under the Special Report on Emission Scenario-A2   and the eight CMIP5 models  under the 140-year 1% CO2 increase per year scenario. Black dots represent a single model simulation and coloured bars the mean of the multi-model results; grey dots are used for models with a coupled terrestrial nitrogen cycle. The comparison with C4MIP is for context, but these metrics are known to be variable across different scenarios and rates of change . Some of the CMIP5 models are derived from models that contributed to C4MIP and some are new to this analysis. Table 6.11 lists the main attributes of each CMIP5 model used in this analysis. The SRES A2 scenario is closer in rate of change to a 0.5% yr-1 scenario and as such it should be expected that the CMIP5  terms are comparable, but the  terms are likely to be around 20% smaller for CMIP5 than for C4MIP due to lags in the ability of the land and ocean to respond to higher rates of CO2 increase . This dependence on scenario  reduces confidence in any quantitative statements of how CMIP5 carbon cycle feedbacks differ from C4MIP.

regions, associated with enhanced carbon uptake in forested areas of already high biomass. In the zonal totals, there is a secondary peak of high L values over NH temperate and boreal ecosystems, partly due to a greater land area there but also coincident with large areas of forest. Models agree on the sign of response but have low agreement on the magnitude. The climate effect alone is projected by the CMIP5 models to reduce land CO2 sinks in tropics and mid latitudes  . CMIP5 models show medium agreement that warming may increase land carbon uptake in high latitudes but none of these models include representation of permafrost carbon pools which are projected to decrease in warmer conditions ; therefore confidence is low regarding the sign and magnitude of future high-latitude land carbon response to climate change. Matthews et al.  showed that vegetation productivity is the major cause of C4MIP model spread, but this manifests itself as changes in soil organic matter .	0
6.4.3.1 The RCP Future Carbon Dioxide Concentration and Emissions Scenarios The CMIP5 simulations include four future scenarios referred to as Representative Concentration Pathways  : RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, RCP8.5 . These future scenarios include CO2 concentration and emissions, and have been generated by four Integrated Assessment Models  and are labelled according to the approximate global radiative forcing level at 2100. These scenarios are described in more detail in Chapter 1  and Section 12.3 and also documented in Annex II. van Vuuren et al.  showed that the basic climate and carbon cycle responses of IAMs is generally consistent with the spread of climate and carbon cycle responses from ESMs. For the physical and biogeochemical components of the RCP scenarios 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5, the underlying IAMs are closely related. Only the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment  IAM, which created RCP2.6, differs markedly by using a more sophisticated carbon cycle sub-model for land and ocean. The Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change 6  simple climate model was subsequently used to generate the CO2 pathway for all four RCP scenarios using the CO2 emissions output by the four IAMs .	0
Not all the CMIP5 ESMs used the full range of information available from the land use change scenarios, such as wood harvest projections or sub-grid scale shifting cultivation. Sensitivity studies indicated that these processes, along with the start date of the simulation, all strongly affect estimated carbon fluxes . Land use has been in the past and will be in the future a significant driver of forest land cover change and terrestrial carbon storage. Land use trajectories in the RCPs show very distinct trends and cover a wide range of projections. These land use trajectories are very sensitive to assumptions made by each individual IAM regarding the amount of land needed for food production . The area of cropland and pasture increases in RCP8.5 with the Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives and their General Environmental Impact  IAM model, mostly driven by an increasing global population, but cropland area also increases in the RCP2.6 with the IMAGE IAM model, as a result of bio-energy production and increased food demand as well. RCP6 with the AIM model shows an expansion of cropland but a decline in pasture land. RCP4.5 with the Global Change Assessment Model  IAM is the only scenario to show a decrease in global cropland. Several studies  highlight the large sensitivity of future land use requirements to assumptions such as increases in crop yield, changes in diet, or how agricultural technology and intensification is applied. Within the IAMs, land use change is translated into land use CO2 emissions as shown in Figure 6.23. Cumulative emissions for the 21st century  vary markedly across RCPs, with increasing cropland and pastureland areas in RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 giving rise to the highest emissions from land use change, RCP4.5 to intermediate emissions and RCP6.0 to close to zero net emissions. All scenarios suggest that 21st century land use emissions will be less than half of those from 1850 to the present day as rate of change of land conversion stabilises in future. The adoption of widely differing approaches among ESMs for the treatment and diagnosis of land use and land cover change  processes in terrestrial carbon cycle models leads to substantial betweenmodel variation in the simulated impact on land carbon stocks. It is not yet possible to fully quantify LULCC fluxes from the CMIP5 model simulations. The harmonization process applied to LULCC data sets for CMIP5 has been an important step toward consistency among IAMs; however, among ESMs, and between IAMs and ESMs, assignment of meaningful uncertainty ranges to present-day and future LULCC fluxes and states remains a critical knowledge gap with implications for compatible emissions to achieve CO2 pathways .	0
The results of the concentration-driven CMIP5 ESMs simulations show medium agreement on the magnitude of cumulative ocean carbon uptake from 1850 to 2005 : average 127  28 PgC . The models show low agreement on the sign and magnitude of changes in land carbon storage : average 2  74 PgC . These central estimates are very close to observational estimates of 125  25 PgC for the ocean and -5  40 PgC for the net cumulative land-atmosphere flux respectively , but show a large spread across models. With very high confidence, for all four RCP scenarios, all models project continued ocean uptake throughout the 21st century, with higher uptake corresponding to higher concentration pathways. For RCP4.5, all the models also project an increase in land carbon uptake, but for RCP2.6, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 a minority of models  project a decrease in land carbon storage at 2100 relative to 2005. Model spread in land carbon projections is much greater than model spread in ocean carbon projections, at least in part due to different treatment of land use change. Decade mean land and ocean fluxes are documented in Annex II, Table AII.3.1a, b. Important processes missing 524	0
from many or all CMIP5 land carbon cycles include the role of nutrient cycles, permafrost, fire and ecosystem acclimation to changing climate. For this reason we assign low confidence to quantitative projections of future land uptake. The concentration-driven ESM simulations can be used to quantify the compatible fossil fuel emissions required to follow the four RCP CO2 pathways . There is significant spread between ESMs, but general consistency between ESMs and compatible emissions estimated by IAMs to define each RCP scenario. However, for RCP8.5 on average, the CMIP5 models project lower compatible emissions than the MESSAGE IAM. The IMAGE IAM predicts that global negative emissions are required to achieve the RCP2.6 decline in radiative forcing from 3 W m-2 to 2.6 W m-2 by 2100. All models agree that strong emissions reductions are required to achieve this after about 2020 . An average emission reduction of 50%  is required by 2050 relative to 1990 levels. There is disagreement between those ESMs that performed this simulation over the necessity for global emissions in the RCP2.6 to become negative by	0

the end of the 21st century to achieve this, with six ESMs simulating negative compatible emissions and four ESM models simulating positive emissions from 2080 to 2100. The RCP2.6 scenario achieves this negative emission rate through use of large-scale bio-energy with carbon-capture and storage . It is as likely as not that sustained globally negative emissions will be required to achieve the reductions in atmospheric CO2 in the RCP2.6 scenario. This would be classed as a carbon dioxide removal  form of geoengineering under the definition used in this IPCC report, and is discussed further in Section 6.5.2. The ESMs themselves make no assumptions about how the compatible emissions could or would be achieved, but merely compute the global total emission that is required to follow the CO2 concentration pathway, accounting for the carbon cycle response to climate and CO2, and for land use change CO2 emissions. The dominant cause of future changes in the airborne fraction of fossil fuel emissions  is the emissions scenario and not carbon cycle feedbacks . Models show high agreement that 21st century cumulative airborne fraction will increase under rapidly increasing CO2 in RCP8.5 and decreases under the peak-and-decline RCP2.6 scenarios. The airborne fraction declines slightly under RCP4.5 and remains of similar magnitude in the RCP6.0 scenario. Between-model spread in changes in the land-fraction is greater than between-scenario spread. Models show high agreement that the ocean fraction will increase under RCP2.6 and remain of similar magnitude in the other RCP scenarios.	0
Several studies  have shown that climate-carbon cycle feedbacks affect the compatible fossil fuel CO2 emissions that are consistent with a given CO2 concentration pathway. Using decoupled RCP4.5 simulations  five CMIP5 ESMs agree that the climate impact on carbon uptake by both land and oceans will reduce the compatible fossil fuel CO2 emissions for that scenario by between 6% and 29% between 2006 and 2100 respectively , equating to an average of 157  76 PgC  less carbon that can be emitted from fossil fuel use if climate feedback  is included. Compatible emissions would be reduced by a greater degree	0
6.4.3.4 Permafrost Carbon Current estimates of permafrost soil carbon stocks are ~1700 PgC , the single largest component of the terrestrial carbon pool. Terrestrial carbon models project a land CO2 sink with warming at high northern latitudes; however none of the models participating in C4MIP or CMIP5 included explicit representation of permafrost soil carbon decomposition in response to future warming. Including permafrost carbon processes into an ESM may change the sign of the high northern latitude carbon cycle response to warming from a sink to a source . Overall, there is high confidence that reductions in permafrost extent due to warming will cause thawing of some currently frozen carbon. However, there is low confidence on the magnitude of carbon losses through CO2 and CH4 emissions to the atmosphere. The magnitude of CO2 and CH4 emissions to the atmosphere is assessed to range from 50 to 250 PgC between 2000 and 2100 for RCP8.5. The magnitude of the source of CO2 to the atmosphere from decomposition of permafrost carbon in response to warming varies widely according to different techniques and scenarios. Process models provide different estimates of the cumulative loss of permafrost carbon: 7 to 17 PgC  , 55 to 69 Pg , 126 to 254 PgC  and 68 to 508 PgC  . Combining observed vertical soil carbon profiles with modeled thaw rates provides an estimate that the total quantity of newly thawed soil carbon by 2100 will be 246 PgC for RCP4.5 and 436 PgC for RCP8.5 , although not all of this amount will be released to the atmosphere on that time scale. Uncertainty estimates suggest the cumulative amount of thawed permafrost carbon could range from 33 to 114 PgC  under RCP8.5 warming , or 50 to 270 PgC  .	0

known with very high confidence. Overall, given evidence from Chapter 3 and model results from this chapter, it is virtually certain that the increased storage of carbon by the ocean will increase acidification in the future, continuing the observed trends of the past decades.

FAQ 6.1 | Could Rapid Release of Methane and Carbon Dioxide from Thawing Permafrost or Ocean Warming Substantially Increase Warming? Permafrost is permanently frozen ground, mainly found in the high latitudes of the Arctic. Permafrost, including the sub-sea permafrost on the shallow shelves of the Arctic Ocean, contains old organic carbon deposits. Some are relicts from the last glaciation, and hold at least twice the amount of carbon currently present in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide . Should a sizeable fraction of this carbon be released as methane and CO2, it would increase atmospheric concentrations, which would lead to higher atmospheric temperatures. That in turn would cause yet more methane and CO2 to be released, creating a positive feedback, which would further amplify global warming. The Arctic domain presently represents a net sink of CO2--sequestering around 0.4  0.4 PgC yr-1 in growing vegetation representing about 10% of the current global land sink. It is also a modest source of methane : between 15 and 50 Tg yr-1 are emitted mostly from seasonally unfrozen wetlands corresponding to about 10% of the global wetland methane source. There is no clear evidence yet that thawing contributes significantly to the current global budgets of these two greenhouse gases. However, under sustained Arctic warming, modelling studies and expert judgments indicate with medium agreement that a potential combined release totalling up to 350 PgC as CO2 equivalent could occur by the year 2100. Permafrost soils on land, and in ocean shelves, contain large pools of organic carbon, which must be thawed and decomposed by microbes before it can be released--mostly as CO2. Where oxygen is limited, as in waterlogged soils, some microbes also produce methane. On land, permafrost is overlain by a surface `active layer', which thaws during summer and forms part of the tundra ecosystem. If spring and summer temperatures become warmer on average, the active layer will thicken, making more organic carbon available for microbial decomposition. However, warmer summers would also result in greater uptake of carbon dioxide by Arctic vegetation through photosynthesis. That means the net Arctic carbon balance is a delicate one between enhanced uptake and enhanced release of carbon.	0
Hydrological conditions during the summer thaw are Flux to sediment also important. The melting of bodies of excess ground ~2 TgC yr-1 ice may create standing water conditions in pools and lakes, where lack of oxygen will induce methane proFAQ 6.1, Figure 1 | A simplified graph of current major carbon pools and flows duction. The complexity of Arctic landscapes under in the Arctic domain, including permafrost on land, continental shelves and ocean. climate warming means we have low confidence in  TgC = 1012 gC, and PgC = 1015 gC. which of these different processes might dominate on a regional scale. Heat diffusion and permafrost melting takes time--in fact, the deeper Arctic permafrost can be seen as a relict of the last glaciation, which is still slowly eroding--so any significant loss of permafrost soil carbon will happen over long time scales.	0
Modelling studies of permafrost dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions indicate a relatively slow positive feedback, on time scales of hundreds of years. Until the year 2100, up to 250 PgC could be released as CO2, and up to 5 Pg as CH4. Given methane's stronger greenhouse warming potential, that corresponds to a further 100 PgC of equivalent CO2 released until the year 2100. These amounts are similar in magnitude to other biogeochemical feedbacks, for example, the additional CO2 released by the global warming of terrestrial soils. However, current models do not include the full complexity of Arctic processes that occur when permafrost thaws, such as the formation of lakes and ponds. Methane hydrates are another form of frozen carbon, occurring in deep permafrost soils, ocean shelves, shelf slopes and deeper ocean bottom sediments. They consist of methane and water molecule clusters, which are only stable in a specific window of low temperatures and high pressures. On land and in the ocean, most of these hydrates originate from marine or terrestrial biogenic carbon, decomposed in the absence of oxygen and trapped in an aquatic environment under suitable temperature-pressure conditions. Any warming of permafrost soils, ocean waters and sediments and/or changes in pressure could destabilise those hydrates, releasing their CH4 to the ocean. During larger, more sporadic releases, a fraction of that CH4 might also be outgassed to the atmosphere. There is a large pool of these hydrates: in the Arctic alone, the amount of CH4 stored as hydrates could be more than 10 times greater than the CH4 presently in the global atmosphere. Like permafrost thawing, liberating hydrates on land is a slow process, taking decades to centuries. The deeper ocean regions and bottom sediments will take still longer--between centuries and millennia to warm enough to destabilise the hydrates within them. Furthermore, methane released in deeper waters has to reach the surface and atmosphere before it can become climatically active, but most is expected to be consumed by microorganisms before it gets there. Only the CH4 from hydrates in shallow shelves, such as in the Arctic Ocean north of Eastern Siberia, may actually reach the atmosphere to have a climate impact. Several recent studies have documented locally significant CH4 emissions over the Arctic Siberian shelf and from Siberian lakes. How much of this CH4 originates from decomposing organic carbon or from destabilizing hydrates is not known. There is also no evidence available to determine whether these sources have been stimulated by recent regional warming, or whether they have always existed--it may be possible that these CH4 seepages have been present since the last deglaciation. In any event, these sources make a very small contribution to the global CH4 budget--less than 5%. This is also confirmed by atmospheric methane concentration observations, which do not show any substantial increases over the Arctic. However modelling studies and expert judgment indicate that CH4 and CO2 emissions will increase under Arctic warming, and that they will provide a positive climate feedback. Over centuries, this feedback will be moderate: of a magnitude similar to other climate-terrestrial ecosystem feedbacks. Over millennia and longer, however, CO2 and CH4 releases from permafrost and shelves/shelf slopes are much more important, because of the large carbon and methane hydrate pools involved.	0
where A = /Ksp, where Ksp is the solubility product for the metastable form of CaCO3 known as aragonite; a value of A <1 thus indicates aragonite undersaturation). This aragonite undersaturation in surface waters is reached before the end of the 21st century in the Southern Ocean as highlighted in AR4, but occurs sooner and is more intense in the Arctic . Ten percent of Arctic surface waters are projected to become undersaturated when atmospheric CO2 reaches 428 ppm . That proportion increases to 50% when atmospheric CO2 reaches 534 ppm . By 2100 under the A2 scenario, much of the Arctic surface is projected to become undersaturated with respect	0
2008). Future projections using ocean carbon cycle models indicate that undersaturated conditions will be reached first in winter . In the Southern Ocean, it is projected that wintertime undersaturation with respect to aragonite will begin when atmospheric CO2 will reach 450 ppm, within 1-3 decades, which is about 100 ppm sooner  than for the annual mean undersaturation . As well, aragonite undersaturation will be first reached during wintertime in parts  of the Arctic when atmospheric CO2 will reach 410 ppm, within a decade . Then, aragonite undersaturation will become widespread in these regions at atmospheric CO2 levels of 500-600 ppm . Although projected changes in pH are generally largest at the surface, the greatest pH changes in the subtropics occur between 200 and 300 m where subsurface increased loads of anthropogenic CO2 are similar to surface changes but the carbonate buffering capacity is lower . This more intense projected subsurface pH reduction is consistent with the observed subsurface changes in pH in the subtropical North Pacific . As	0

subsurface saturation states decline, the horizon separating undersaturated waters below from supersaturated waters above is projected to move upward . By 2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario, the median projection from 11 CMIP5 models is that this interface  will shoal from 200 m up to 40 m in the subarctic Pacific, from 1000 m up to the surface in the Southern Ocean, and from 2850 m to 150 m in the North Atlantic , consistent with results from previous model comparison . Under the SRES A2 scenario, the volume of ocean with supersaturated waters is projected to decline from 42% in the preindustrial Era to 25% in 2100 . Yet even if atmospheric CO2 does not go above 450 ppm, most of the deep ocean volume is projected to become undersaturated with respect to both aragonite and calcite after several centuries . Nonetheless, the most recent projections under all RCPs scenarios but RCP8.5 illustrate that limiting atmospheric CO2 will greatly reduce the level of ocean acidification that will be experienced . In the open ocean, future reductions in surface ocean pH and CaCO3  saturation states are controlled mostly by the invasion of anthropogenic carbon. Other effects due to future climate change counteract less than 10% of the reductions in CaCO3 saturation induced by the invasion of anthropogenic carbon . Warming dominates other effects from climate-change by reducing CO2 solubility and thus by enhancing . An exception is the Arctic Ocean where reductions in pH and CaCO3 saturation states are projected to be exacerbated by effects from increased freshwater input due to sea ice melt, more precipitation, and greater air-sea CO2 fluxes due to less sea ice cover . The projected effect of freshening is consistent with current observations of lower saturation states and lower pH values near river mouths and in areas under substantial fresh-water influence . Regional ocean carbon cycle models project that some nearshore systems are also highly vulnerable to future pH decrease. In the California Current System, an eastern boundary upwelling system, observations and model results show that strong seasonal upwelling of carbonrich waters  renders surface waters as vulnerable to future ocean acidification as those in the Southern Ocean . In the Northwestern European Shelf Seas, large spatiotemporal variability is enhanced by local effects from river input and organic matter degradation, exacerbating acidification from anthropogenic CO2 invasion . In the Gulf of Mexico and East China Sea, coastal eutrophication, another anthropogenic perturbation, has been shown to enhance subsurface acidification as additional respired carbon accumulates at depth .	0

Future changes in dissolved O2 have been investigated using models of various complexity . The global ocean dissolved oxygen will decline significantly under future scenarios . Simulated declines in mean dissolved O2 concentration for the global ocean range from 6 to 12 mol kg-1 by the year 2100 , with a projection of 3 to 4 mol kg-1 in one model with low climate sensitivity . This general trend is confirmed by the latest projections from the CMIP5 Earth System models, with reductions in mean dissolved O2 concentrations from 1.5 to 4%  in 2090s relative to 1990s for all RCPs . Most modelling studies  explain the global decline in dissolved oxygen by enhanced surface ocean stratification leading to reductions in convective mixing and deep water formation and by a contribution of 18 to 50% from ocean warming-induced reduction in solubility. These two effects are in part compensated by a small increase	0

A number of biogeochemical ocean carbon cycle feedbacks, not yet included in most marine biogeochemical models , could also impact future trends of ocean deoxygenation. For example, model experiments which include a pCO2sensitive C:N drawdown in primary production, as suggested by some mesocosm experiments , project future increases of up to 50% in the volume of the suboxic waters by 2100 . In addition, future marine hypoxia could be amplified by changes in the CaCO3 to organic matter `rain ratio' in response to rising pCO2 . Reduction in biogenic calcification due to ocean acidification would weaken the strength of CaCO3 mineral ballasting effect, which could lead organic material to be remineralized at a shallower depth exacerbating the future expansion of shallow hypoxic waters. The modeled estimates do not take into account processes that are specific to the coastal ocean and may amplify deoxygenation. Recent observations for the period 1976-2000 have shown that dissolved O2 concentrations have declined at a faster rate in the coastal ocean  than the open ocean (-0.02 mol kg-1 y-1, and a faster 534	0
rate than in the period 1951-1975, indicating a worsening of hypoxia . Hypoxia in the shallow coastal ocean  is largely eutrophication driven and is controlled by the anthropogenic flux of nutrients  and organic matter from rivers. If continued industrialisation and intensification of agriculture yield larger nutrient loads in the future, eutrophication should intensify , and further increase the coastal ocean deoxygenation. On longer time scales beyond 2100, ocean deoxygenation is projected to increase with some models simulating a tripling in the volume of suboxic waters by 2500 . Ocean deoxygenation and further expansion of suboxic waters could persist on millennial time scales, with average dissolved O2 concentrations projected to reach minima of up to 56 mol kg-1 below pre-industrial levels in experiments with high CO2 emissions and high climate sensitivity . A potential expansion of hypoxic or suboxic water over large parts of the ocean is likely to impact the marine cycling of important nutrients, particularly nitrogen. The intensification of low oxygen waters has been suggested to lead to increases in water column denitrification and N2O emissions . Recent works, however, suggest that oceanic N2O production is dominated by nitrification with a contribution of 7% by denitrification , Figure 6.4c) and that ocean deoxygenation in response to anthropogenic climate change could leave N2O production relatively unchanged .	0

6.4.6.1 Projections for Formation of Reactive Nitrogen by Human Activity Since the 1970s, food production, industrial activity and fossil fuel combustion have resulted in the creation of more reactive nitrogen  than natural terrestrial processes . Building on the general description of the set of AR4 Special Report on Emission  scenarios, Erisman et al.  estimated anthropogenic nitrogen fertiliser consumption throughout the 21st century. Five driving parameters  are used to project future nitrogen demands for four scenarios  . Assigning these drivers to these four SRES scenarios, they estimated a production of Nr for agricultural use of 90 to 190 TgN yr-1 by 2100, a range that spans from slightly less to almost twice as much current fertiliser consumption rates . Despite the uncertainties and the non-inclusion of many important drivers, three of the scenarios generated by the Erisman et al.  model point towards an increase in future production of reactive	0
nitrogen. In particular, the A1 scenario which assumes a world with rapid economic growth, a global population that peaks mid-century and rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies ends up as the potentially largest contributor to nitrogen use, as a result of large amounts of biofuels required and the fertiliser used to produce it. This increase in nitrogen use is assumed to be largely in line with the RCP2.6 scenario, where it appears to have rather limited adverse effects like increasing N2O emissions . N2O emissions are projected to increase from increased anthropogenic Nr production. It is thus likely that N2O emissions from soils will increase due to the increased demand for feed/food and the reliance of agriculture on nitrogen fertilisers. This is illustrated by the comparison of emissions from 1900 to those in 2000 and 2050, using the IAM IMAGE model that served to define the RCP2.6 pathway . The anthropogenic N2O emission map IN 2050 shown in Figure 6.32 is established from the RCP4.5 scenario; the RCP8.5 and RCP6 scenarios have much higher emissions, and RCP2.6 much lower . A spatially explicit inventory of soil nitrogen budgets in livestock and crop production systems using the IMAGE model  shows that between 1900 and 1950, the global soil Nr budget surplus almost doubled to 36 TgN yr-1, and further increased to 138 TgN yr-1 between 1950 and 2000. The IMAGE model scenario from Bouwman et al.  shown in Figure 6.32 portrays a world with a 535	0
Regional to global scale model simulations suggest a strong effect of climate variability on interannual variability of land N2O emissions . Kesik et al.  found for European forests that higher temperatures and lower soil moisture will decrease future N2O emissions under scenarios of climate change, despite local increases of emission rates by up to 20%. Xu-Ri et al.  show that local climate trends result in a spatially diverse pattern of increases and decreases of N2O emissions, which globally integrated result in a net climate response of N2O emissions of 1 TgN yr-1 per 1C of land temperature warming. Using a further development of this model, Stocker et al.  estimate increases in terrestrial N2O from a pre-industrial terrestrial source of 6.9 TgN  yr-1 to 9.8 to 11.1 TgN  yr-1  and 14.2 to 17.0 TgN  yr-1  by 2100. Of these increases, 1.1 to 2.4 TgN  yr-1  or 4.7 to 7.7 TgN  yr-1  are due to the interacting effects of climate and CO2 on N2O emissions from natural and agricultural ecosystems. An independent modelling study suggested a climate change related increase of N2O emissions between 1860 and 2100 by 3.1 TgN  yr-1 for the A2 SRES scenario  implying a slightly lower sensitivity of soil N2O emissions to climate of 0.5 TgN  yr-1 per 1C warming. While the present-day contribution of these climate-mediated effects on the radiative forcing from N2O is likely to be small	0
Modelling results  suggest that the climate and CO2-related amplification of terrestrial N2O emissions imply a larger feedback of 0.03 to 0.05 W m-2 C-1 by 2100. With the continuing increases in the formation of Nr from anthropogenic activities will come increased Nr emissions and distribution of Nr by waters and the atmosphere. For the atmosphere, the main driver of future global nitrogen deposition is the emission trajectories of NOy and NH3. For all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6, nitrogen deposition is projected to remain relatively constant globally although there is a projected increase in NHx deposition and decrease in NOy deposition. On a regional basis, future decreases of NHx and NOx are projected in North America and northern Europe, and increases in Asia . Spatially, projected changes in total nitrogen deposition driven primarily by increases in NHx emissions occur over large regions of the world for all RCPs, with generally the largest in RCP8.5 and the smallest in RCP2.6  . Previous IPCC scenarios  project a near doubling of atmospheric nitrogen deposition over some world biodiversity hotspots with half of these hotspots subjected to deposition rates greater than 15 kgN ha-1 yr-1  over at least 10% of their total area . Large uncertainties remain in our understanding and modelling of changes in Nr emissions, atmospheric transport and deposition processes, lead to low confidence in the projection of future Nr deposition fluxes, particularly in regions remote from anthropogenic emissions . The large spread between atmospheric GCM models associated with precipitation projections confounds extraction	0
6.4.6.2. Projected Changes in Sulphur Deposition Given the tight coupling between the atmospheric nitrogen and sulphur cycles, and the impact on climate  this Chapter also presents scenarios for sulphur deposition. Deposition of SOx is projected to decrease in all RCP pathways . By contrast, scenarios established prior to RCPs indicated decreases of sulphur deposition in North America and Europe, but increases in South America, Africa, South and East Asia . In all RCPs, sulphur deposition is lower by 2100 than in 2000 in all regions, with the largest decreases in North America, Europe and Asia  . Future hot spots of deposition are still evident in East and South East Asia, especially for RCP6.0. Projected future increase of Nr input into terrestrial ecosystems also yields increased flux of Nr from rivers into coastal systems. As illustrated by the Global NEWS 2 model for 2050, by the base year 2000,	0
6.4.6.3 Impact of Future Changes in Reactive Nitrogen on Carbon Uptake and Storage Anthropogenic Nr addition and natural nitrogen-cycle responses to global changes will have an important impact on the global carbon cycle. As a principal nutrient for plant growth, nitrogen can both limit future carbon uptake and stimulate it depending on changes in Nr availability. A range of global terrestrial carbon cycle models have been developed since AR4 that integrate nitrogen dynamics into the simulation of land carbon cycling . However, only two ESMs in CMIP5  include a description of nitrogen-carbon interactions. In response to climate warming, increased decomposition of soil organic matter increases nitrogen mineralisation,  which can enhance Nr uptake and carbon storage by vegetation. Generally, higher C:N ratio in woody vegetation compared to C:N ratio of soil organic matter causes increased ecosystem carbon storage as increased Nr uptake shifts nitrogen from soil to vegetation . In two studies , this effect was strong enough to turn the carbon-climate interaction into a small negative feedback, that is, an increased land CO2 uptake in response to climate warming , whereas in another study that described carbon-nitrogen interactions  the carbon-climate interaction was reduced but remained positive, that is, decreased land CO2 uptake in response to climate change . The two CMIP5 ESMs which include terrestrial carbon-nitrogen interactions  also simulate a small but positive climate-carbon feedback. Consistent with the observational evidence , modelling studies have shown a strong effect of Nr availability in limiting the response of plant growth and land carbon storage to elevated atmospheric CO2 . These analyses are affected by the projected future trajectories of anthropogenic Nr deposition. The effects of Nr deposition counteract the nitrogen limitation of CO2 fertilisation . Estimates of the total net carbon storage on land due to Nr deposition between 1860 and 2100 range between 27 and 66 PgC . It is very likely that, at the global scale, nutrient limitation will reduce the global land carbon storage projected by CMIP5 carbon-cycle only models. Only two of the current CMIP5 ESM models explicitly consider carbon-nitrogen interactions . 537	0
The effect of the nitrogen limitations on terrestrial carbon sequestration in the results of the other CMIP5 models may be approximated by comparing the implicit Nr requirement given plausible ranges of terrestrial C:N stoichiometry  to plausible increases in terrestrial Nr supply due to increased biological nitrogen fixation  and anthropogenic Nr deposition . For the ensemble of CMIP5 projections under the RCP 8.5 scenario, this implies a lack of available nitrogen of 1.3 to 13.1 PgN which would reduce terrestrial C sequestration by an average of 137 PgC over the period 1860-2100, with a range of 41 to 273 PgC among models. This represents an ensemble mean reduction in land carbon sequestration of 55%, with a large spread across models . Inferred reductions in ensemble-mean land carbon sink over the same period for RCPs 6.0, 4.5 and 2.6 are 109, 117 and 85 PgC, respectively. Between-model variation in these inferred reduced land carbon sinks is similar for all RCPs, with ranges of 57 to 162 PgC, 38 to 208 PgC, and 32 to 171 PgC for RCPs 6.0, 4.5 and 2.6, respectively. The SOx Deposition	0
Direct effects on wetland CH4 emissions include: higher NPP under higher temperature and higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations leading to more substrate for methanogenesis ; higher CH4 production rates under higher temperature; and changes in CH4 oxidation through changed precipitation that alters water table position . Wetland CH4 emissions are also affected by changes in wetland area which may either increase  or decrease  regionally. In most models, elevated CO2 has a stronger enhancement effect on CH4 emissions than climate change. However, large uncertainties exist concerning the lack of wetland specific plant functional types in most models and the lack of understanding how wetland plants will react to CO2 fertilisation .	0

Blue bars show, for each RCP scenario, the multi-model ensemble mean of land carbon sequestration, based on the carbon-only subset of CMIP5 models , Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory-Earth System Model 2G , Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory-Earth System Model 2M , Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model 2-Carbon Cycle, Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model 2-Earth System , Institute Pierre Simon Laplace-Coupled Model 5A-Low Resolution , Institute Pierre Simon Laplace- Coupled Model 5A-Medium Resolution , Institute Pierre Simon Laplace-Coupled Model 5B-Low Resolution , Max Planck Institute-Earth System Model-Low Resolution : not all models produced results for all scenarios). Red bars show, for each scenario, the mean land carbon sequestration from the same ensemble of carbon-only models after correcting for inferred constraints on carbon uptake due to limited availability of nitrogen. Black bars show  one standard deviation around the means. Black symbols show individual model results from the two CMIP5 models with explicit carbon-nitrogen interactions  and Norwegian Earth System Model 1  ). These two models have nearly identical representations of land carbon-nitrogen dynamics, and differences between them here  are due to differences in coupled system climate. All simulations shown here used prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentrations.	0
Since AR4, several modelling studies have attempted to quantify the sensitivity of global wetland CH4 emissions to environmental changes . The studies cover a wide range of simulation results but there is high agreement between model results that the combined effect of CO2 increase and climate change by the end of the 21st century will increase wetland CH4 emissions. Using a common experimental protocol with spatially uniform changes in precipitation, temperature and CO2  seven models predict that the effect of increased temperature alone  may cause an increase or decrease of wetland CH4 emissions, while the effect of increased precipitation alone  is always an increase, although generally small. The effect of increased atmospheric CO2 concentration  always resulted in an increase of emissions . Other studies assessed the effects of temperature and precipitation together  and often found an increase in wetland CH4 emissions  although Ringeval et al.  found a net decrease. The combined effect of climate and CO2 resulted in an increase of wetland CH4 emissions from 40% ; fixed wetland area) to 68% ; variable wetland area).	0
Figure 6.36 | Schematic synthesis of the magnitude and time scales associated with possible future CH4 emissions . Uncertainty in these future changes is large, and so this figure demonstrates the relative magnitude of possible future changes. Anthropogenic emissions starting at a present-day level of 300 Tg yr-1  and increasing or decreasing according to RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 are shown for reference. Wetland emissions are taken as 140 to 280 Tg yr-1 present day values  and increasing by between 0 and 100% . Permafrost emissions may become important during the 21st century. CH4 release from marine hydrates and subsea permafrost may also occur but uncertainty is sufficient to prevent plotting emission rates here. Large CH4 hydrate release to the atmosphere is not expected during the 21st century. No quantitative estimates of future changes in CH4 emissions from wildfires exist, so plotted here are continued present-day emissions of 1 to 5 Tg yr-1 .	0
There is high agreement between land surface models that permafrost extent is expected to reduce during the 21st century, accompanying particularly rapid warming at high latitudes . However, estimates vary widely as to the pace of degradation . The LPJWHyMe model projected permafrost area loss of 30%  and 47%  by 2100 . Marchenko et al.  calculate that by 2100, 57% of Alaska will lose permafrost within the top 2 m. For the RCP scenarios, the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble shows a wide range of projections for permafrost loss: 15 to 87% under RCP4.5 and 30 to 99% under RCP8.5 .	0

6.4.7.3 Future Methane Hydrate Emissions Substantial quantities of methane are believed to be stored within submarine hydrate deposits at continental margins . There is concern that warming of overlying waters may melt these deposits, releasing CH4 into the ocean and atmosphere systems. Overall, it is likely that subsequent emissions to the atmosphere caused by hydrate destabilisation would be in the form of CO2, due to CH4 oxidation in the water column. Considering a potential warming of bottom waters by 1C, 3C and 5C during the next 100 years, Reagan and Moridis  found that hydrates residing in a typical deep ocean setting  would be stable and in shallow low-latitude settings  any sea floor CH4 fluxes would be oxidized within the sediments. Only in cold-shallow Arctic settings  would CH4 fluxes exceed rates of benthic sediment oxidation. Simulations of heat penetration through the sediment by Fyke and Weaver  suggest that changes in the gas hydrate stability zone will be small on century time scales except in high-latitude regions of shallow ocean shelves. In the longer term, Archer et al.  estimated that between 35 and 940 PgC could be released over several thousand years in the future following a 3C seafloor warming.	0
Using multiple climate models , predicted an upper estimate of the global sea floor flux of between 560 and 2140 Tg yr-1, mostly in the high latitudes. Hunter et al.  also found 21st century hydrate dissociation in shallow Arctic waters and comparable in magnitude to Biastoch et al. , although maximum CH4 sea floor fluxes were smaller than Lamarque , with emissions from 330 to 450 Tg yr-1 for RCP 4.5 to RCP8.5. Most of the sea floor flux of CH4 is expected to be oxidised in the water column into dissolved CO2. Mau et al.  suggest only 1% might be released to the atmosphere but this fraction depends on the depth of water and ocean conditions. Elliott et al.  demonstrated significant impacts of such sea floor release on marine hypoxia and acidity, although atmospheric CH4 release was small. Observations of CH4 release along the Svalbard margin seafloor  suggest observed regional warming of 1C during the last 30 years is driving hydrate disassociation, an idea supported by modelling . However, these studies do not consider subsea-permafrost hydrates suggested recently to be regionally significant sources of atmospheric CH4 . There was no positive excursion in the methane concentration recorded in ice cores from the largest known submarine landslide, the Storegga 542	0
6.4.8.1 Changes in Fire under Climate Change/Scenarios of Anthropogenic Fire Changes Regional studies for boreal regions suggest an increase in future fire risk  with implications for carbon and nutrient storage . Kurz et al.  and Metsaranta et al.  indicated that increased fire activity has the potential to turn the Canadian forest from a sink to a source of atmospheric CO2. Models predict spatially variable responses in fire activity, including strong increases and decreases, due to regional variations in the climate-fire relationship, and anthropogenic interference . Wetter conditions can reduce fire activity, but increased biomass availability can increase fire emissions . Using a land surface model and future climate projections from two GCMs, Kloster et al.  projected fire carbon emissions in 2075-2099 that exceed present-day emissions by 17 to 62%  depending on scenario. Future fire activity will also depend on anthropogenic factors especially related to land use change. For the Amazon it is estimated that at present 58% of the area is too humid to allow deforestation fires but climate change might reduce this area to 37% by 2050 . Golding and Betts  estimated that future Amazon forest vulnerability to fire may depend nonlinearly on combined climate change and deforestation.	0
With very high confidence, the physical, biogeochemical carbon cycle in the ocean and on land will continue to respond to climate change and rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations created during the 21st century. Long-term changes in vegetation structure and induced carbon storage potentially show larger changes beyond 2100 than during the 21st century as the long time scale response of tree growth and ecosystem migrations means that by 2100 only a part of the eventual committed change will be realized . Holocene changes in tree-line lagged changes in climate by centuries . Long-term `commitments' to ecosystems migration also carry long-term committed effects to changes in terrestrial carbon storage  and permafrost . Warming of high latitudes is common to most climate models  and this may enable increased productivity and northward expansion of boreal forest ecosystems into present tundra regions depending on nutrient availability . CMIP5 simulations by two ESMs with dynamic vegetation for extended RCP scenarios to 2300  allow analysis of this longer term response of the carbon cycle. Increases in tree cover and terrestrial carbon storage north of 60N are shown in Figure 6.38.	0

Note the RCP6.0 extension was not a CMIP5 required simulation. Model results were interpolated on 1 x 1 grid; white colour indicates areas where models disagree in sign of changes. Anthropogenic land use in these extension scenarios is kept constant at 2100 levels, so these results show the response of natural ecosystems to the climate change.	0
FAQ 6.2 | What Happens to Carbon Dioxide After It Is Emitted into the Atmosphere? Carbon dioxide , after it is emitted into the atmosphere, is firstly rapidly distributed between atmosphere, the upper ocean and vegetation. Subsequently, the carbon continues to be moved between the different reservoirs of the global carbon cycle, such as soils, the deeper ocean and rocks. Some of these exchanges occur very slowly. Depending on the amount of CO2 released, between 15% and 40% will remain in the atmosphere for up to 2000 years, after which a new balance is established between the atmosphere, the land biosphere and the ocean. Geological processes will take anywhere from tens to hundreds of thousands of years--perhaps longer--to redistribute the carbon further among the geological reservoirs. Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and associated climate impacts of present emissions, will, therefore, persist for a very long time into the future. CO2 is a largely non-reactive gas, which is rapidly mixed throughout the entire troposphere in less than a year. Unlike reactive chemical compounds in the atmosphere that are removed and broken down by sink processes, such as methane, carbon is instead redistributed among the different reservoirs of the global carbon cycle and ultimately recycled back to the atmosphere on a multitude of time scales. FAQ 6.2, Figure 1 shows a simplified diagram of the global carbon cycle. The open arrows indicate typical timeframes for carbon atoms to be transferred through the different reservoirs. Atmosphere	0
Before the Industrial Era, the global carbon cycle was roughly balanced. This can be inferred from ice core measurements, which show a near constant atmospheric concentration of CO2 over the last several thousand years prior to the Industrial Era. Anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, however, have disturbed that equilibrium. As global CO2 concentrations rise, the exchange processes between CO2 and the surface ocean and vegetation are altered, as are subsequent exchanges within and among the carbon reservoirs on land, in the ocean and eventually, the Earth crust. In this way, the added carbon is redistributed by the global carbon cycle, until the exchanges of carbon between the different carbon reservoirs have reached a new, approximate balance.	0
Over the ocean, CO2 molecules pass through the air-sea interface by gas exchange. In seawater, CO2 interacts with water molecules to form carbonic acid, FAQ 6.2, Figure 1 | Simplified schematic of the global carbon cycle showing which reacts very quickly with the large reservoir of the typical turnover time scales for carbon transfers through the major reservoirs. dissolved inorganic carbon--bicarbonate and carbonate ions--in the ocean. Currents and the formation of sinking dense waters transport the carbon between the surface and deeper layers of the ocean. The marine biota also redistribute carbon: marine organisms grow organic tissue and calcareous shells in surface waters, which, after their death, sink to deeper waters, where they are returned to the dissolved inorganic carbon reservoir by dissolution and microbial decomposition. A small fraction reaches the sea floor, and is incorporated into the sediments. Sediments	0
The extra carbon from anthropogenic emissions has the effect of increasing the atmospheric partial pressure of CO2, which in turn increases the air-to-sea exchange of CO2 molecules. In the surface ocean, the carbonate chemistry quickly accommodates that extra CO2. As a result, shallow surface ocean waters reach balance with the atmosphere within 1 or 2 years. Movement of the carbon from the surface into the middle depths and deeper waters takes longer--between decades and many centuries. On still longer time scales, acidification by the invading CO2 dissolves carbonate sediments on the sea floor, which further enhances ocean uptake. However, current understanding suggests that, unless substantial ocean circulation changes occur, plankton growth remains roughly unchanged because it is limited mostly by environmental factors, such as nutrients and light, and not by the availability of inorganic carbon it does not contribute significantly to the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2. 	0
On land, vegetation absorbs CO2 by photosynthesis and converts it into organic matter. A fraction of this carbon is immediately returned to the atmosphere as CO2 by plant respiration. Plants use the remainder for growth. Dead plant material is incorporated into soils, eventually to be decomposed by microorganisms and then respired back into the atmosphere as CO2. In addition, carbon in vegetation and soils is also converted back into CO2 by fires, insects, herbivores, as well as by harvest of plants and subsequent consumption by livestock or humans. Some organic carbon is furthermore carried into the ocean by streams and rivers. An increase in atmospheric CO2 stimulates photosynthesis, and thus carbon uptake. In addition, elevated CO2 concentrations help plants in dry areas to use ground water more efficiently. This in turn increases the biomass in vegetation and soils and so fosters a carbon sink on land. The magnitude of this sink, however, also depends critically on other factors, such as water and nutrient availability. Coupled carbon-cycle climate models indicate that less carbon is taken up by the ocean and land as the climate warms constituting a positive climate feedback. Many different factors contribute to this effect: warmer seawater, for instance, has a lower CO2 solubility, so altered chemical carbon reactions result in less oceanic uptake of excess atmospheric CO2. On land, higher temperatures foster longer seasonal growth periods in temperate and higher latitudes, but also faster respiration of soil carbon. The time it takes to reach a new carbon distribution balance depends on the transfer times of carbon through the different reservoirs, and takes place over a multitude of time scales. Carbon is first exchanged among the `fast' carbon reservoirs, such as the atmosphere, surface ocean, land vegetation and soils, over time scales up to a few thousand years. Over longer time scales, very slow secondary geological processes--dissolution of carbonate sediments and sediment burial into the Earth's crust--become important. FAQ 6.2, Figure 2 illustrates the decay of a large excess amount of CO2  emitted into the atmosphere, and how it is redistributed among land and the ocean over time. During the first 200 years, the ocean and land take up similar amounts of carbon. On longer time scales, the ocean uptake dominates mainly because of its larger reservoir size  as compared to land  and atmosphere . Because of ocean chemistry the size of the initial input is important: higher emissions imply that a larger fraction of CO2 will remain in the atmosphere. After 2000 years, the atmosphere will still contain between 15% and 40% of those initial CO2 emissions. A further reduction by carbonate sediment dissolution, and reactions with igneous rocks, such as silicate weathering and sediment burial, will take anything from tens to hundreds of thousands of years, or even longer. Ocean invasion Land uptake	0
Increases in fire disturbance or insect damage may drive loss of forest in temperate regions , but this process is poorly represented or not accounted at all in models. Recent evidence from models  and studies on climate variability  suggests that large scale loss of tropical forest as previously projected in some models  is unlikely, but depends strongly on the predicted future changes in regional temperature  and precipitation , although both models here simulate reduced tree cover and carbon storage for the RCP8.5 scenario. ESMs also poorly simulate resilience of ecosystems to climate changes and usually do not account for possible existence of alternative ecosystem states such as tropical forest or savannah . Regional specific changes in ecosystem composition and carbon storage are uncertain but it is very likely that ecosystems will continue to change for decades to centuries following stabilisation of GHGs and climate change.	0
To slow or perhaps reverse projected increases in atmospheric CO2 , several methods have been proposed to increase the removal of atmospheric CO2 and enhance the storage of carbon in land, ocean and geological reservoirs. These methods are categorized as `Carbon Dioxide Removal ' methods . Another class of methods involves the intentional manipulation of planetary solar absorption to counter climate change, and is called the `Solar Radiation Management ' . In this section, CDR methods are discussed from the aspect of the carbon cycle processes  and their impacts and side effects on carbon cycle and climate . A brief discussion on the indirect carbon cycle effects of SRM methods is given in Section 6.5.4. Most of the currently proposed CDR methods are summarized in Table 6.14 and some are illustrated schematically in Chapter 7 . Since some CDR methods might operate on large spatial scales they are also called `Geoengineering' proposals . Removal of CH4 and N2O has also been proposed to reduce climate change . While the science of geoengineering methods is assessed in this section  and Chapter 7 , the benefits and risks of SRM are planned to be assessed in Chapter 19 of AR5 WGII report. Further, Chapter 6 of AR5 WGIII report plans to assess the cost and socioeconomic implications of some CDR and SRM methods for climate stabilization pathways. Large-scale industrial methods such as carbon capture and storage , biofuel energy production  and reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation  cannot be called CDR methods since they reduce fossil fuel use or land use change CO2 emissions to the atmosphere but they do not involve a net removal of CO2 that is already in the atmosphere. However, direct air capture of CO2 using industrial methods  will 	0
remove CO2 from the atmosphere and is thus considered as a CDR method. The distinction between CDR and mitigation  is not clear and there could be some overlap between the two. Insofar as the CDR-removed CO2 is sequestered in a permanent reservoir, CDR methods could potentially reduce direct consequences of high CO2 levels, including ocean acidification  . However, the effects of CDR methods that propose to manipulate carbon cycle processes are slow  and hence the consequent climate effects would be slow. The climate system has a less than 5-years relaxation  time scale for an assumed instantaneous reduction in radiative forcing to preindustrial levels . While the climate effect of SRM could be rapid  given this time scale, at present, there is no known CDR method, including industrial direct air capture that can feasibly reduce atmospheric CO2 to pre-industrial levels within a similar time scale. Therefore, CDR methods do not present an option for rapidly preventing climate change when compared to SRM. It is likely that CDR would have to be deployed at large-scale for at least one century to be able to significantly reduce atmospheric CO2. Important carbon cycle science considerations for evaluating CDR methods include the associated carbon storage capacity, the permanence of carbon storage and potential adverse side effects . Geological reservoirs could store several thousand PgC and the ocean may be able to store a few thousand PgC of anthropogenic carbon in the long-term  . The terrestrial biosphere may have a typical potential to store carbon equivalent to the cumulative historical land use loss of 180  80 PgC . In this assessment, we use "permanence" to refer to time scales larger than tens of thousands of years. CDR methods associated with either permanent or non-permanent carbon sequestration  have very different climate implications . Permanent sequestration methods have the potential to reduce the radiative forcing of CO2 over time. By contrast, non-permanent sequestration methods will release back the temporarily sequestered carbon as CO2 to the atmosphere, after some delayed time interval . As a consequence, elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 and climate warming will only be delayed and not avoided by the implementation of non-permanent CDR methods . Nevertheless, CDR methods that could create a temporary CO2 removal  may still have value  by reducing the cumulative impact of higher temperature. Another important carbon cycle consequence of CDR methods is the `rebound effect' . In the Industrial Era  about half of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere from fossil fuel emissions has been taken up by land and ocean carbon reservoirs . As for current CO2 emissions and the consequent CO2 rise, which are currently opposed by uptake of CO2 by natural reservoirs, any removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by CDR will be opposed by release of CO2 from natural reservoirs . It is thus virtually certain that the removal of CO2 by CDR will be partially offset by outgassing of CO2 from the ocean and land ecosystems. Therefore, return-	0
The CDR methods listed in Table 6.14 rely primarily on human management of carbon cycle processes to remove CO2:  enhanced net biological uptake and subsequent sequestration by land ecosystems,  enhanced biological production in ocean and subsequent sequestration in the ocean and  accelerated chemical weathering reactions over land and ocean. The exceptional CDR method is industrial direct air capture of CO2, for example, relying on chemistry methods. CO2 removed by CDR is expected to be stored in organic form on land and in inorganic form in ocean and geological reservoirs . This management of the carbon cycle however has other implications on ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. The principle of different CDR methods listed in Table 6.14 is described below and the characteristics of some CDR methods are summarized in Table 6.15. Some of the RCP scenarios used as a basis for future projections in this Assessment Report already include some CDR methods. To achieve the RCP2.6 CO2 peak and decline the IMAGE integrated assessment model simulates widespread implementation of BECCS technology to	0
6.5.2.1 Enhanced Carbon Sequestration by Land Ecosystems The key driver of these CDR methods is net primary productivity on land that currently produces biomass at a rate of approximately 50 to 60 PgC yr-1 . The principle of these CDR methods is to increase net primary productivity and/or store a larger fraction of the biomass produced into ecosystem carbon pools with long turnover times, for example, under the form of wood or refractory organic matter in soils . One variant is to harvest biomass for energy production and sequester the emitted CO2 . BECCS technology has not been tested at industrial scale, but is commonly included in Integrated Assessment Models and future scenarios that aim to achieve low CO2 concentrations. Estimates of the global potential for enhanced primary productivity over land are uncertain because the potential of any specific method will be severely constrained by competing land needs  and sociocultural considerations. An order of magnitude of the upper potential of afforestation/ reforestation would be the restoration of all the carbon released by 547	0
Figure 6.39 | Idealised model simulations  to illustrate the effects of CDR methods associated with either permanent or non-permanent carbon sequestration. There is an emission of 1000 PgC in the reference case  between 1800 and 2100, corresponding approximately to RCP4.5 scenario . Permanent sequestration of 380 PgC, assuming no leakage of sequestered carbon would reduce climate change . By contrast, a non-permanent sequestration CDR method where carbon will be sequestered and later on returned to the atmosphere in three centuries would not. In this idealised non-permanent sequestration example scenario, climate change would only be delayed but the eventual magnitude of climate change will be equivalent to the no-sequestration case .

Figure 6.40 | Idealised simulations with a simple global carbon cycle model  to illustrate the `rebound effect'. Effects of an instantaneous cessation of CO2 emissions in the year 2050 , one-time removal of the excess of atmospheric CO2 over pre-industrial levels  and removal of this excess of atmospheric CO2 followed by continued removal of all the CO2 that degasses from the ocean  are shown. For the years 1850-2010 observed atmospheric CO2 concentrations are prescribed and CO2 emissions are calculated from CO2 concentrations and modeled carbon uptake. For the years 2011-2049, CO2 emissions are prescribed following the SRES A2 scenario. Starting from year 2050, CO2 emission is either set to zero or calculated from modeled CO2 concentrations and CO2 uptake. To a first approximation, a cessation of emissions would prevent further warming but would not lead to significant cooling on the century time scale. A one-time removal of excess atmospheric CO2 would eliminate approximately only half of the warming experienced at the time of the removal because of CO2 that outgases from the ocean . To bring atmospheric CO2 back to pre-industrial levels permanently, would require the removal of all previously emitted CO2, that is, an amount equivalent to approximately twice the excess atmospheric CO2 above pre-industrial level. 	0
Notes: a Physical potential does not account for economic or environmental constraints of CDR methods; for example, the value of the physical potential for afforestation and reforestation does not consider the conflicts with land needed for agricultural production. Potentials for BECCS and biochar are highly speculative. b If 2.5 tC yr-1 per hectare can be harvested on a sustainable basis  on about 4%  of global land  for BECCS, approximately 1.25 PgC yr-1 could be removed or about 125 PgC in this century. Future CO2 concentration pathways, especially RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 include some CO2 removal by BECCS  and hence the potentials estimated here cannot add on to existing model results .	0
organic carbon produced gets transported to the deep ocean. Some of the inorganic carbon in the surface ocean that is removed by the export of net primary productivity below the surface layer will be subsequently replaced by CO2 pumped from the atmosphere, thus removing atmospheric CO2. Ocean primary productivity is limited by nutrients . Enhanced biological production in ocean CDR methods  is obtained by adding nutrients that would otherwise be limiting . The expected increase in the downward flux of carbon can be partly sequestered as Dissolved Inorganic Carbon  after mineralization in the intermediate and deep waters. In other ocean-based CDR methods, algae and kelp farming and burial, carbon would be stored in organic form.	0
experiments  have shown only limited transient effects of iron addition in removing atmospheric CO2. An increased productivity was indeed observed, but this effect was moderated either by other limiting elements, or by compensatory respiration from increased zooplankton grazing. Most of the carbon produced by primary productivity is oxidized  in the surface layer, so that only a small fraction is exported to the intermediate and deep ocean  although some studies indicate little remineralization in the surface layer . A recent study  finds that at least half the extra carbon in plankton biomass generated by artificial iron addition sank far below a depth of 1000 m, and that a substantial portion is likely to have reached the sea floor. There are some indications that sustained natural iron fertilisation may have a higher efficiency in exporting carbon from surface to intermediate and deep ocean than short term blooms induced by artificial addition of iron . Thus, there is no consensus on the efficiency of iron fertilisation from available field experiments. Using ocean carbon models , the maximum drawdown of atmospheric CO2 have been estimated from 15 ppm  to 33 ppm  for an idealised continuous  global ocean iron fertilisation, which is technically unrealistic. In other idealised simulations of ocean fertilisation in the global ocean or only in the Southern Ocean , atmospheric CO2 was reduced by less than 100 ppm for ideal conditions. Jin and Gruber  obtained an atmospheric drawdown of more than 60 ppm over 100 years from an idealised iron fertilisation scenario over the entire Southern Ocean. The radiative benefit from lower CO2 could be offset by a few percent to more than 100% from an increase in N2O emissions . All the above estimates of maximum potential CO2 removal account for the rebound effect from oceans but not from the land . One ocean CDR variant is to artificially supply more nutrients to the surface ocean in upwelling areas . The amount of carbon sequestered by these enhanced upwelling methods critically depends on their location . Idealised simulations suggest an atmospheric CO2 removal at a net rate of about 0.9 PgC yr-1 . This oceanbased CDR method has not been tested in the field, unlike iron addition experiments.	0
time scale. For instance, large amounts of silicate minerals such as olivine 2SiO4) could be mined, crushed, transported to and distributed on agricultural lands, to remove atmospheric CO2 and form carbonate minerals in soils and/or bicarbonate ions that would be transported to the ocean by rivers l. Alternatively, CO2 removal by weathering reactions might be enhanced by exposing minerals such as basalt or olivine to elevated CO2, with potential CO2 removal rates exceeding 0.25 PgC yr-1 . In the idealised case where olivine could be spread as a fine powder over all the humid tropics, potential removal rates of up to 1 PgC yr-1 have been estimated, despite limitations by the saturation concentration of silicic acid . For the United Kingdom, the potential from silicate resources was estimated to be more than 100 PgC . Fossil fuel CO2 released to the atmosphere leads to the addition of anthropogenic CO2 in the ocean . This anthropogenic CO2 will eventually dissolve ocean floor carbonate sediments to reach geochemical equilibrium on a 10 kyr time scale . The principle of ocean based weathering CDR methods is to accelerate this process. For instance, carbonate rocks could be crushed, reacted with CO2  to produce bicarbonate ions that would be released to the ocean . Alternatively, carbonate minerals could be directly released into the ocean . Strong bases, derived from silicate rocks, could also be released to ocean  to increase alkalinity and drawdown of atmospheric CO2. Carbonate minerals such as limestone could be heated to produce lime 2); this lime could be added to the ocean to increase alkalinity as well . While the level of confidence is very high for the scientific understanding of weathering chemical reactions, it is low for its effects and risks at planetary scale .	0
Carbon Dioxide Removal by Direct Industrial Capture of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Direct Air Capture refers to the chemical process by which a pure CO2 stream is produced by capturing CO2 from ambient air. The captured CO2 could be sequestered in geological reservoirs or the deep ocean. At least three methods have been proposed to capture CO2 from the atmosphere:  adsorption on solids ;  absorption into highly alkaline solutions  and  absorption into moderate alkaline solution with a catalyst . The main limitation to direct air capture is the thermodynamic barrier due to the low concentration of CO2 in ambient air.	0
Impacts of Enhanced Land Carbon Sequestration In the case of land-based CDR, biomass in forests is a non-permanent ecosystem carbon pool and hence there is a risk that this carbon may return to the atmosphere, for example, by disturbances such as fire, or by future land use change. When considering afforestation/reforestation, it is also important to account for biophysical effects on climate that come together with carbon sequestration because afforestation/ reforestation changes the albedo , evapotranspiration and the roughness of the surface . Modelling studies show that afforestation in seasonally snow covered boreal and temperate regions will decrease the land surface albedo and have a net  warming effect, whereas afforestation in low latitudes  is likely to enhance latent heat flux from evapotranspiration and have a net cooling effect . Consequently, the location of land ecosystem based CDR methods needs to be considered carefully when evaluating their effects on climate . In addition CDR in land ecosystems is likely to increase N2O emissions . Enhanced biomass production may also require more nutrients  which are associated with fossil fuel CO2 emission from industrial fertiliser production and Nr impacts. Biochar-based CDR could reduce N2O emissions but may increase CO2 and CH4 emissions from agricultural soils . Addition of biochar could also promote a rapid loss of forest humus and soil carbon in some ecosystems during the first decades .	0
Impact of Enhanced Weathering In the case of weathering-based CDR, the pH and carbonate mineral saturation of soils, rivers and ocean surface waters will increase where CDR is implemented. Kohler et al.  simulated that the pH of the Amazon river would rise by 2.5 units if the dissolution of olivine in the entire Amazon basin was used to remove 0.5 PgC yr-1 from the atmosphere. In the marine environment, elevated pH and increased alkalinity could potentially counteract the effects of ocean acidification, which is beneficial. Changes in alkalinity could also modify existing ecosystems. There is uncertainty in our understanding of the net effect on ocean CO2 uptake but there will be a partial offset of the abiotic effect by calcifying species. As for other CDR methods, the confidence level on the carbon cycle impacts of enhanced weathering is low.	0
6.5.3.2 Impacts of Enhanced Carbon Sequestration in the Ocean In the case of ocean-based CDR using fertilisation, adding macronutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate in the fertilised region could lead to a decrease in production `downstream' of the fertilised region . Gnanadesikan et al.  simulated a decline in export production of 30 tC for every ton removed from the atmosphere. A sustained global-ocean iron fertilisation for SRES A2 CO2 emission scenario was also found to acidify the deep ocean  while mitigating surface pH change by only 0.06 . Other environmental risks associated with ocean fertilisation include expanded regions with low oxygen concentration , increased N2O emission , increased production of dimethylsulphide , isoprene, CO, N2O, CH4 and other non-CO2 GHGs  and possible disruptions to marine ecosystems . In the case of enhanced ocean upwelling CDR methods there could be disturbance to the regional carbon balances, since the extra-upwelling will be balanced by extra-downwelling at another location. Along with growth-supporting nutrients, enhanced concentrations of DIC will also be brought to surface waters and partially offset the removal of CO2 by increased biological pump. Further, in case artificially enhanced upwelling would be stopped, atmospheric CO2 concentrations could	0
SRM could reduce climate warming but will not interfere with the direct biogeochemical effects of elevated CO2 on the carbon cycle. For example, ocean acidification caused by elevated CO2  and the CO2 fertilisation of productivity  will not be altered by SRM . Similarly, SRM will not interfere with the stomatal response of plants to elevated CO2  that leads to a decline in evapotranspiration, causing land temperatures to warm and runoff to increase . However, due to carbon-climate feedbacks , the implementation of SRM could affect the carbon cycle. For instance, carbon uptake by land and ocean could increase in response to SRM by reducing the negative effects of climate change on carbon sinks . For instance, for the SRES A2 scenario with SRM, a lower CO2 concentration of 110 ppm by year 2100 relative to a baseline case without SRM has been simulated by Matthews and Caldeira . Land carbon sinks may be enhanced by increasing the amount of diffuse relative to direct radiation  if SRM causes the fraction of diffuse light to increase . However, reduction of total incoming solar radiation could decrease terrestrial CO2 sinks as well. 551	0
CDR methods are intentional large scale methods to remove atmospheric CO2 either by managing the carbon cycle or by direct industrial processes . In contrast to SRM methods, CDR methods that manage the carbon cycle are unlikely to present an option for rapidly preventing climate change. The maximum  potential for atmospheric CO2 removal by individual CDR methods is compiled in Table 6.15. In this compilation, note that unrealistic assumptions about the scale of deployment, such as fertilising the entire global ocean, are used, and hence large potentials are simulated. The `rebound effect' in the natural carbon cycle is likely to diminish the effectiveness of all the CDR methods . The level of confidence on the effects of both CDR and SRM methods on carbon and other biogeochemical cycles is very low.	0
Progress in Understanding Many of the cloudiness and humidity changes simulated by climate models in warmer climates are now understood as responses to large-scale circulation changes that do not appear to depend strongly on sub-grid scale model processes, increasing confidence in these changes. For example, multiple lines of evidence now indicate positive feedback contributions from circulation-driven changes in both the height of high clouds and the latitudinal distribution of clouds . However, some aspects of the overall cloud response vary substantially among models, and these appear to depend strongly on sub-grid scale processes in which there is less confidence. Recent research has clarified the importance of distinguishing forcing  and rapid adjustments  from feedbacks . Furthermore, one can distinguish between the traditional concept of radiative forcing  and the relatively new concept of effective radiative forcing 	0
Water Vapour, Cloud and Aerosol Feedbacks The net feedback from water vapour and lapse rate changes combined, as traditionally defined, is extremely likely2 positive . The sign of the net radiative feedback due to all cloud types is less certain but likely positive. Uncertainty in the sign and magnitude of the cloud feedback is due primarily to continuing uncertainty in the impact of warming on low clouds. We estimate the water vapour plus lapse rate feedback3 to be +1.1  W m-2 C-1 and the cloud feedback from all cloud types to be +0.6  W m-2 C-1. These ranges are broader than those of climate models to account for additional uncertainty associated with processes that may not have been accounted for in those models. The mean values and ranges in climate models are essentially unchanged since AR4, but are now supported by stronger indirect observational evidence and better process understanding, especially for water vapour. Low clouds contribute positive feedback in most models, but that behaviour is not well understood, nor effectively constrained by observations, so we are not confident that it is realistic. 	0
Quantification of climate forcings4 due to aerosols and clouds The ERF due to aerosol-radiation interactions that takes rapid adjustments into account  is assessed to be -0.45  W m-2. The RF from absorbing aerosol on snow and ice is assessed separately to be +0.04  W m-2. Prior to adjustments taking place, the RF due to aerosol-radiation interactions  is assessed to be -0.35  W m-2. The assessment for RFari is less negative than reported in AR4 because of a re-evaluation of aerosol absorption. The uncertainty estimate is wider but more robust, based on multiple lines of evidence from models, remotely sensed data, and ground-based measurements. Fossil fuel and biofuel emissions4 contribute to RFari via sulphate aerosol: -0.4  W m-2, black carbon  aerosol: +0.4  W m-2, and primary and secondary organic aerosol: -0.12  W m-2. Additional RFari contributions occur via biomass b urning	0
emissions5: +0.0  W m-2, nitrate aerosol: -0.11  W m-2, and mineral dust: -0.1  W m-2 although the latter may not be entirely of anthropogenic origin. While there is robust evidence for the existence of rapid adjustment of clouds in response to aerosol absorption, these effects are multiple and not well represented in climate models, leading to large uncertainty. Unlike in the last IPCC assessment, the RF from BC on snow and ice includes the effects on sea ice, accounts for more physical processes and incorporates evidence from both models and observations. This RF has a 2 to 4 times larger global mean surface temperature change per unit forcing than a change in CO2. 	0
Geoengineering Using Solar Radiation Management Methods Theory, model studies and observations suggest that some Solar Radiation Management  methods, if practicable, could substantially offset a global temperature rise and partially offset some other impacts of global warming, but the compensation for the climate change caused by GHGs would be imprecise . SRM methods are unimplemented and untested. Research on SRM is in its infancy, though it leverages understanding of how the climate responds to forcing more generally. The efficacy of a number of SRM strategies was assessed, and there is medium confidence that stratospheric aerosol SRM is scalable to counter the RF from increasing GHGs at least up to approximately 4 W m-2; however,	0
the required injection rate of aerosol precursors remains very uncertain. There is no consensus on whether a similarly large RF could be achieved from cloud brightening SRM owing to uncertainties in understanding and representation of aerosol-cloud interactions. It does not appear that land albedo change SRM can produce a large RF. Limited literature on other SRM methods precludes their assessment. Models consistently suggest that SRM would generally reduce climate differences compared to a world with elevated GHG concentrations and no SRM; however, there would also be residual regional differences in climate  when compared to a climate without elevated GHGs. 	0
The atmosphere is composed mostly of gases, but also contains liquid and solid matter in the form of particles. It is usual to distinguish these particles according to their size, chemical composition, water content and fall velocity into atmospheric aerosol particles, cloud particles and falling hydrometeors. Despite their small mass or volume fraction, particles in the atmosphere strongly influence the transfer of radiant energy and the spatial distribution of latent heating through the atmosphere, thereby influencing the weather and climate. Cloud formation usually takes place in rising air, which expands and cools, thus permitting the activation of aerosol particles into cloud droplets and ice crystals in supersaturated air. Cloud particles are generally larger than aerosol particles and composed mostly of liquid water or ice. The evolution of a cloud is governed by the balance between a number of dynamical, radiative and microphysical processes. Cloud particles of sufficient size become falling hydrometeors, which are categorized as drizzle drops, raindrops, snow crystals, graupel and hailstones. Precipitation is an important and complex climate variable that is influenced by the distribution of moisture and cloudiness, and to a lesser extent by the concentrations and properties of aerosol particles. Aerosol particles interact with solar radiation through absorption and scattering and, to a lesser extent with terrestrial radiation through absorption, scattering and emission. Aerosols6 can serve as cloud condensation nuclei  and ice nuclei  upon which cloud droplets and ice crystals form. They also play a wider role in atmospheric chemistry and biogeochemical cycles in the Earth system, for instance, by carrying nutrients to ocean ecosystems. They can be of natural or anthropogenic origin. Cloud and aerosol amounts7 and properties are extremely variable in space and time. The short lifetime of cloud particles in subsaturated air creates relatively sharp cloud edges and fine-scale variations in cloud properties, which is less typical of aerosol layers. While the distinction between aerosols and clouds is generally appropriate and useful, it is not always unambiguous, which can cause interpretational difficulties .	0
inter-model differences in cloud feedbacks constitute by far the primary source of spread of both equilibrium and transient climate responses simulated by climate models  despite the fact that most models agree that the feedback is positive . Thus confidence in climate projections requires a thorough assessment of how cloud processes have been accounted for. Aerosols of anthropogenic origin are responsible for a radiative forcing  of climate change through their interaction with radiation, and also as a result of their interaction with clouds. Quantification of this forcing is fraught with uncertainties  and aerosols dominate the uncertainty in the total anthropogenic RF . Furthermore, our inability to better quantify non-greenhouse gas RFs, and primarily those that result from aerosol- cloud interactions, underlie difficulties in constraining climate sensitivity from observations even if we had a perfect knowledge of the temperature record . Thus a complete understanding of past and future climate change requires a thorough assessment of aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions.	0
Figure 7.1 illustrates key aspects of how clouds and aerosols contribute to climate change, and provides an overview of important terminological distinctions. Forcings associated with agents such as greenhouse gases  and aerosols act on global mean surface temperature through the global radiative  budget. Rapid adjustments  arise when forcing agents, by altering flows of energy internal to the system, affect cloud cover or other components of the climate system and thereby alter the global budget indirectly. Because these adjustments do not operate through changes in the global mean surface temperature , which are slowed by the massive heat capacity of the oceans, they are generally rapid and most are thought to occur within a few weeks. Feedbacks are associated with changes in climate variables that are mediated by a change in global mean surface temperature; they contribute to amplify or damp global temperature changes via their impact on the radiative budget. In this report, following an emerging consensus in the literature, the traditional concept of radiative forcing  is de-emphasized in favour of an absolute measure of the radiative effects of all responses triggered by the forcing agent that are independent of surface temperature change . This new measure of the forcing includes rapid adjustments and the net forcing with these adjustments included is termed the effective radiative forcing . The climate sensitivity to ERF will differ somewhat from traditional equilibrium climate sensitivity, as the latter include adjustment effects. As shown in Figure 7.1, adjustments can occur through geographic temperature variations, lapse rate changes, cloud changes	0
Figure 7.1 | Overview of forcing and feedback pathways involving greenhouse gases, aerosols and clouds. Forcing agents are in the green and dark blue boxes, with forcing mechanisms indicated by the straight green and dark blue arrows. The forcing is modified by rapid adjustments whose pathways are independent of changes in the globally averaged surface temperature and are denoted by brown dashed arrows. Feedback loops, which are ultimately rooted in changes ensuing from changes in the surface temperature, are represented by curving arrows . The final temperature response depends on the effective radiative forcing  that is felt by the system, that is, after accounting for rapid adjustments, and the feedbacks.	0
In principle rapid adjustments are independent of DT, while feedbacks operate purely through DT. Thus, within this framework adjustments are not another type of `feedback' but rather a non-feedback phenomenon, required in the analysis by the fact that a single scalar DT cannot fully characterize the system. This framework brings most efficacies close to unity although they are not necessarily exactly 1 . There is also no clean separation in time scale between rapid adjustments and warming. Although the former occur mostly within a few days of applying a forcing , some adjustments such as those that occur within the stratosphere and snowpack can take several months or longer. Meanwhile the land surface warms quickly so that a small part of DT occurs within days to weeks of an applied forcing. This makes the two phenomena difficult to isolate in model runs. Other drawbacks are that adjustments are difficult to observe, and typically more model-dependent than RF. However, recent work is beginning to meet the challenges of quantifying the adjustments, and has noted advantages of the new framework . There is no perfect method to determine ERF. Two common methods are to regress the net energy imbalance onto DT in a transient	0
Figure 7.2 | Radiative forcing  and effective radiative forcing  estimates derived by two methods, for the example of 4 x CO2 experiments in one climate model. N is the net energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere and DT the global mean surface temperature change. The fixed sea surface temperature ERF estimate is from an atmosphere-land model averaged over 30 years. The regression estimate is from 150 years of a coupled model simulation after an instantaneous quadrupling of CO2, with the N from individual years in this regression shown as black diamonds. The stratospherically adjusted RF is the tropopause energy imbalance from otherwise identical radiation calculations at 1 x and 4 x CO2 concentrations.  See also Figure 8.1.	0
warming simulation , or to simulate the climate response with sea surface temperatures  held fixed . The former can be complicated by natural variability or time-varying feedbacks, while the non-zero DT from land warming complicates the latter. Both methods are used in this chapter. Figure 7.3 links the former terminology of aerosol direct, semi-direct and indirect effects with the new terminology used in this chapter and in Chapter 8. The RF from aerosol-radiation interactions  encompasses radiative effects from anthropogenic aerosols before any adjustment takes place and corresponds to what is usually referred to as the aerosol direct effect. Rapid adjustments induced by aerosol radiative effects on the surface energy budget, the atmospheric profile and cloudiness contribute to the ERF from aerosol-radiation interactions . They include what has earlier been referred to as the semi-direct effect. The RF from aerosol-cloud interactions  refers to the instantaneous effect on cloud albedo due to changing concentrations of cloud condensation and ice nuclei, also known as the Twomey effect. All subsequent changes to the cloud lifetime and thermodynamics are rapid adjustments, which contribute to the ERF from aerosol-cloud interactions . RFaci is a theoretical construct that is not easy to separate from other aerosol-cloud interactions and is therefore not quantified in this chapter.	0
can produce a broader spectrum of particle sizes and types; turbulent mixing produces further variations in cloud properties on scales from kilometres to less than a centimetre . If and when some of the droplets or ice particles become large enough, these will fall out of the cloud as precipitation. Atmospheric flows often organize convection and associated clouds into coherent systems having scales from tens to thousands of kilometres, such as cyclones or frontal systems. These represent a significant modelling and theoretical challenge, as they are usually too large to represent within the limited domains of cloud-resolving models , but are also not well resolved nor parameterized by most climate models; this gap, however, is beginning to close . Finally, clouds and cloud systems are organized by larger-scale circulations into different regimes such as deep convection near the equator, subtropical marine stratocumulus, or mid-latitude storm tracks guided by the tropospheric westerly jets. Figure 7.4 shows a selection of widely occurring cloud regimes schematically and as they might appear in a typical geostationary satellite image. New satellite sensors and new analysis of previous data sets have given us a clearer picture of the Earth's clouds since AR4. A notable example	0
is the launch in 2006 of two coordinated, active sensors, the Cloud Profiling Radar  on the CloudSat satellite  and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization  on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations  satellite . These sensors have significantly improved our ability to quantify vertical profiles of cloud occurrence and water content , and complement the detection capabilities of passive multispectral sensors . Satellite cloud-observing capacities are reviewed by Stubenrauch et al. . Clouds cover roughly two thirds of the globe , with a more precise value depending on both the optical depth threshold used to define cloud and the spatial scale of measurement . The mid-latitude oceanic storm tracks and tropical precipitation belts are particularly cloudy, while continental desert regions and the central subtropical oceans are relatively cloud-free. Clouds are composed of liquid at temperatures above 0C, ice below about -38C , and either or both phases at intermediate temperatures . Throughout most of the troposphere, temperatures at any given altitude are usually warmer in the tropics, but clouds also extend higher there such that ice	0

cloud amounts are no less than those at high latitudes. At any given time, most clouds are not precipitating . In this chapter cloud above the 440 hPa pressure level is considered `high', that below the 680 hPa level `low', and that in-between is considered `mid-level'. Most high cloud  occurs near the equator and over tropical continents, but can also be seen in the mid-latitude storm track regions and over mid-latitude continents in summer ; it is produced by the storms generating most of the global rainfall in regions where tropospheric air motion is upward, such that dynamical, rainfall and high-cloud fields closely resemble one another . Mid-level cloud , comprising a variety of types, is prominent in the storm tracks and some occurs in the Intertropical Convergence Zone . Low cloud , including shallow cumulus and stratiform cloud, occurs over essentially all oceans but is most prevalent over cooler subtropical oceans and in polar regions. It is less common over land, except at night and in winter. Overlap between cloud layers has long been an issue both for satellite  detection and for calculating cloud radiative effects. Active sensors show more clearly that low clouds are prevalent in nearly all types of convective systems, and are often underestimated by models . Cloud layers at different levels overlap less often than typically assumed in General Circulation Models , especially	0
7.2.1.2 Effects of Clouds on the Earth's Radiation Budget The effect of clouds on the Earth's present-day top of the atmosphere  radiation budget, or cloud radiative effect , can be inferred from satellite data by comparing upwelling radiation in cloudy and non-cloudy conditions . By enhancing the planetary albedo, cloudy conditions exert a global and annual shortwave cloud radiative effect  of approximately -50 W m-2 and, by contributing to the greenhouse effect, exert a mean longwave effect  of approximately +30 W m-2, with a range of 10% or less between published satellite estimates . Some of the apparent LWCRE comes from the enhanced water vapour coinciding with the natural cloud fluctuations used to measure the effect, so the true cloud LWCRE is about 10% smaller . The net global mean CRE of approximately -20 W m-2 implies a net cooling	0
Figure 7.6 |  December-January-February mean high, middle and low cloud cover from CloudSat/CALIPSO 2B-GEOPROF R04 and 2B-GEOPROF-LIDAR P1.R04 data sets for 2006-2011 , 500 hPa vertical pressure velocity , and Global Precipitation Climatology Project  version 2.2 precipitation rate ;  same as , except for June-July-August. For low clouds, the GCM-Oriented CALIPSO Cloud Product  data set for 2007-2010  is used at locations where it indicates a larger fractional cloud cover, because the GEOPROF data set removes some clouds with tops at altitudes below 750 m. Low cloud amounts are probably underrepresented in regions of high cloud , although not as severely as with earlier satellite instruments.	0
The regional patterns of annual-mean TOA CRE  reflect those of the altitude-dependent cloud distributions. High clouds, which are cold compared to the clear-sky radiating temperature, dominate patterns of LWCRE, while the SWCRE is sensitive to optically thick clouds at all altitudes. SWCRE also depends on the available sunlight, so for example is sensitive to the diurnal and seasonal cycles of cloudiness. Regions of deep, thick cloud with large positive LWCRE and large negative SWCRE tend to accompany precipitation , showing their intimate connection with the hydrological cycle. The net CRE is negative over most of the globe and most negative in regions of very extensive low-lying reflective stratus and stratocumulus cloud such as the mid-latitude and eastern subtropical oceans, where SWCRE is strong but LWCRE is weak . In these regions, the spatial distribution of net CRE on seasonal time scales correlates strongly with measures of low-level stability or inversion strength .	0
Clouds also exert a CRE at the surface and within the troposphere, thus affecting the hydrological cycle and circulation , though this aspect of CRE has received less attention. The net downward flux of radiation at the surface is sensitive to the vertical and horizontal distribution of clouds. It has been estimated more accurately through radiation budget measurements and cloud profiling . Based on these observations, the global mean surface downward longwave flux is about 10 W m-2 larger than the average in climate models, probably due to insufficient model-simulated cloud cover or lower tropospheric moisture . This is consistent with a global mean precipitation rate in the real world somewhat larger than current observational estimates.	0
idealized settings, or with boundary conditions for specific observed cases. This strategy is typically called large-eddy simulation  when boundary-layer eddies are resolved, and cloud-resolving model  when only deep cumulus motions are well resolved. It is useful not only in simulating cloud and precipitation characteristics, but also in understanding how turbulent circulations within clouds transport and process aerosols and chemical constituents. It can be applied to any type of cloud system, on any part of the Earth. Direct numerical simulation  can be used to study turbulence and cloud microphysics on scales of a few metres or less  but cannot span crucial meteorological scales and is not further considered here. Cloud microphysics, precipitation and aerosol interactions are treated with varying levels of sophistication, and remain a weak point in all models regardless of resolution. For example, recent comparisons to satellite data show that liquid water clouds in CRMs generally begin to rain too early in the day . Especially for ice clouds, and for interactions between aerosols and clouds, our understanding of the basic micro-scale physics is not yet adequate, although it is improving. Moreover, microphysical effects are quite sensitive to co-variations of velocity and composition down to very small scales. High-resolution models, such as those used for LES, explicitly calculate most of these variations, and so provide much more of the information needed for microphysical calculations, whereas in a GCM they are not explicitly available. For these reasons, low-resolution  models will have even more trouble representing local aerosol-cloud interactions than will high-resolution models. Parameterizations are under development that could account for the small-scale variations statistically  but have not been used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  simulations. High-resolution models have enhanced our understanding of cloud processes in several ways. First, they can help interpret in situ and high-resolution remote sensing observations . Second, they have revealed important influences of small-scale interactions, turbulence, entrainment and precipitation on cloud dynamics that must eventually be accounted for in parameterizations . Third, they can be used to predict how cloud system properties  may respond to climate changes . Fourth, they have become an important tool in testing and improving parameterizations of cloud-controlling processes such as cumulus convection, turbulent mixing, small-scale horizontal cloud variability and aerosol-cloud interactions , as well as the interplay between convection and large-scale circulations . Different aspects of clouds, and cloud types, require different grid resolutions. CRMs of deep convective cloud systems with horizontal resolutions of 2 km or finer  can represent some statistical properties of the cloud system, including fractional area coverage of cloud , vertical thermodynamic structure , the distribution of updraughts and downdraughts  and organization into mesoscale convective	0
systems . Modern high-order turbulence closure schemes may allow some statistics of boundary-layer cloud distributions, including cloud fractions and fluxes of moisture and energy, to be reasonably simulated even at horizontal resolution of 1 km or larger . Finer grids  better resolve individual storm characteristics such as vertical velocity or tracer transport. Some cloud ensemble properties remain sensitive to CRM microphysical parameterization assumptions regardless of resolution, particularly the vertical distribution and optical depth of clouds containing ice. Because of these requirements, it is computationally demanding to run a CRM in a domain large enough to capture convective organisation or perform regional forecasts. Some studies have created smaller regions of CRM-like resolution within realistically forced regional-scale models , a special case of the common `nesting' approach for regional downscaling . One application has been to orographic precipitation, associated both with extratropical cyclones  and with explicitly simulated cumulus convection ; better resolution of the orography improves the simulation of precipitation initiation and wind drift of falling rain and snow between watersheds. LES of shallow cumulus cloud fields with horizontal grid spacing of about 100 m and vertical grid spacing of about 40 m produces vertical profiles of cloud fraction, temperature, moisture and turbulent fluxes that agree well with available observations , though the simulated precipitation efficiency still shows some sensitivity to microphysical parameterizations . LES of stratocumulus-topped boundary layers reproduces the turbulence statistics and vertical thermodynamic structure well , and has been used to study the sensitivity of stratocumulus properties to aerosols  and meteorological conditions. However, the simulated entrainment rate and cloud liquid water path are sensitive to the underlying numerical algorithms, even with vertical grid spacings as small as 5 m, due to poor resolution of the sharp capping inversion . These grid requirements mean that low-cloud processes dominating the known uncertainty in cloud feedback cannot be explicitly simulated except in very small domains. Thus, notwithstanding all of the above benefits of explicit cloud modeling, these models cannot on their own quantify global cloud feedbacks or aerosol-cloud interactions definitively. They are important, however, in suggesting and testing feedback and adjustment mechanisms .	0
Global Cloud-Resolving Models  have been run with grid spacings as small as 3.5 km . At present GCRMs can be used only for relatively short simulations of a few simulated months to a year or two on the fastest supercomputers, but in the not-too distant future they may provide climate projections. GCRMs provide a consistent way to couple convective circulations to large-scale dynamics, but must still parameterize the effects of individual clouds, microphysics and boundary-layer circulations. Because they avoid the use of uncertain cumulus parameterizations, GCRMs better simulate many properties of convective circulations that are very challenging for many current conventional GCMs, including the diurnal cycles of precipitation  and the Asian summer monsoon . Inoue et al.  showed that the cloudiness simulated by a GCRM is in good agreement with observations from CloudSat and CALIPSO, but the results are sensitive to the parameterizations of turbulence and cloud microphysics . Heterogeneous multiscale methods, in which CRMs are embedded in each grid cell of a larger scale model , have also been further developed as a way to realize some of the advantages of GCRMs but at less cost. This approach has come to be known as super-parameterization, because the CRM effectively replaces some of the existing GCM parameterizations . Super-parameterized models, which are sometimes called multiscale modeling frameworks, occupy a middle ground between high-resolution `process models' and `climate models' , in terms of both advantages and cost. Like GCRMs, super-parameterized models give more realistic simulations of the diurnal cycle of precipitation  and the Madden-Julian Oscillation  than most conventional GCMs; they can also improve aspects of the Asian monsoon and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation . Moreover, because they also begin to resolve cloud-scale circulations, both strategies provide a framework for studying aerosol-cloud interactions that conventional GCMs lack . Thus both types of global model provide important insights, but because neither of them fully resolves cloud processes, especially for low clouds , their results must be treated with caution just as with conventional GCMs.	0
Figure 7.8 | Model and simulation strategy for representing the climate system and climate processes at different space and time scales. Also shown are the ranges of space and time scales usually associated with cloud processes  and the climate system . Classes of models are usually defined based on the range of spatial scales they represent, which in the figure is roughly spanned by the text for each model class. The temporal scales simulated by a particular type of model vary more widely. For instance, climate models are often run for a few time steps for diagnostic studies, or can simulate millennia. Hence the figure indicates the typical time scales for which a given model is used. Computational power prevents one model from covering all time and space scales. Since the AR4, the development of Global Cloud Resolving Models , and hybrid approaches such as General Circulation Models  using the `super-parameterization' approach ), have helped fill the gap between climate system and cloud process models.	0
affects many aspects of a model's overall simulated climate including the Hadley circulation, precipitation patterns, and tropical variability. Therefore continuing weakness in these parameterizations affects not only modeled climate sensitivity, but also the fidelity with which these other variables can be simulated or projected. Most CMIP5 climate model simulations use horizontal resolutions of 100 to 200 km in the atmosphere, with vertical layers varying between 100 m near the surface to more than 1000 m aloft. Within regions of this size in the real world, there is usually enormous small-scale variability in cloud properties, associated with variability in humidity, temperature and vertical motion . This variability must be accounted for to accurately simulate cloud-radiation interaction, condensation, evaporation and precipitation and other cloud processes that crucially depend on how cloud condensate is distributed across each grid box . The simulation of clouds in modern climate models involves several parameterizations that must work in unison. These include parameterization of turbulence, cumulus convection, microphysical processes, radiative transfer and the resulting cloud amount , as well as sub-grid scale transport of aerosol and chemical species. The system of parameterizations must balance simplicity, realism, computational stability and efficiency. Many cloud processes are unrealistic in current GCMs, and as such their cloud response to climate change remains uncertain. Cloud processes and/or turbulence parameterization are important not only for the GCMs used in climate projections but also for specialized chemistry-aerosol-climate models ,	0
Recent development efforts have been focused on the introduction of more complex representations of microphysical processes, with the dual goals of coupling them better to atmospheric aerosols and linking them more consistently to the sub-grid variability assumed by the model for other calculations. For example, most CMIP3 climate models predicted the average cloud and rain water mass in each grid cell only at a given time, diagnosing the droplet concentration using empirical relationships based on aerosol mass , or altitude and proximity to land. Many were forced to employ an arbitrary lower bound on droplet concentration to reduce the aerosol RF . Such formulations oversimplify microphysically mediated cloud variations. By contrast, more models participating in CMIP5 predict both mass and number mixing ratios for liquid stratiform cloud. Some determine rain and snow number concentrations and mixing ratios , allowing treatment of aerosol scavenging and the radiative effect of snow. Some models explicitly treat sub-grid cloud water variability for calculating microphysical process rates . Cloud droplet activation schemes now account more realistically for particle composition, mixing and size . Despite such advances in internal consistency, a continuing weakness in GCMs  is their inability to fully represent turbulent motions to which microphysical processes are highly sensitive. 7.2.3.2.2	0
Ice treatments are following a path similar to those for liquid water, and face similar but greater challenges because of the greater complexity of ice processes. Many CMIP3 models predicted the condensed water amount in just two categories--cloud and precipitation--with a temperature-dependent partitioning between liquid and ice within either category. Although supersaturation with respect to ice is commonly observed at low temperatures, only one CMIP3 GCM  allowed ice supersaturation . Many climate models now include separate, physically based equations for cloud liquid versus cloud ice, and for rain versus snow, allowing a more realistic treatment of mixed-phase processes and ice supersaturation . These new schemes are tested in a single-column model against cases observed in field campaigns  or against satellite observations , and provide superior simulations of cloud structure	0
than typical CMIP3 parameterizations . However new observations reveal complexities not correctly captured by even relatively advanced schemes . New representations of the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process in mixed-phase clouds  compare the rate at which the pre-existing ice crystals deplete the water vapour with the condensation rate for liquid water driven by vertical updraught speed ; these are not yet included in CMIP5 models. Climate models are increasingly representing detailed microphysics, including mixed-phase processes, inside convective clouds . Such processes can influence storm characteristics like strength and electrification, and are crucial for fully representing aerosol-cloud interactions, but are still not included in most climate models; their representation is moreover subject to all the caveats noted in Section 7.2.3.1.	0
7.2.3.3 Recent Advances in Parameterizing Moist Turbulence and Convection Both the mean state and variability in climate models are sensitive to the parameterization of cumulus convection. Since AR4, the development of convective parameterization has been driven largely by rapidly growing use of process models, in particular LES and CRMs, to inform parameterization development . Accounting for greater or more state-dependent entrainment of air into deep cumulus updraughts has improved simulations of the Madden- Julian Oscillation, tropical convectively coupled waves and mean rainfall patterns in some models  but usually at the expense of a degraded simulation of the mean state. In another model, revised criteria for convective initiation and parameterizations of cumulus momentum fluxes improved ENSO and tropical vertical temperature profiles . Since AR4, more climate models have adopted cumulus parameterizations that diagnose the expected vertical velocity in cumulus updraughts , in principle allowing more complete representations of aerosol activation, cloud microphysical evolution and gravity wave generation by the convection. Several new parameterizations couple shallow cumulus convection more closely to moist boundary layer turbulence  including cold pools generated by nearby deep convection . Many of these efforts have led to more accurate simulations of boundary-layer cloud radiative properties and vertical structure , and have ameliorated the common problem of premature deep convective initiation over land in one CMIP5 GCM .	0
7.2.3.5 Cloud Modelling Synthesis Global climate models used in CMIP5 have improved their representation of cloud processes relative to CMIP3, but still face challenges and uncertainties, especially regarding details of small-scale variability that are crucial for aerosol-cloud interactions . Finerscale LES and CRM models are much better able to represent this variability and are an important research tool, but still suffer from imperfect representations of aerosol and cloud microphysics and known biases. Most CRM and LES studies do not span the large space and time scales needed to fully determine the interactions among different cloud regimes and the resulting net planetary radiative effects. Thus our assessments in this chapter do not regard any model type on its own as definitive, but weigh the implications of process model studies in assessing the quantitative results of the global models.	0
Climate feedbacks determine the sensitivity of global surface temperature to external forcing agents. Water vapour, lapse rate and cloud feedbacks each involve moist atmospheric processes closely linked to clouds, and in combination, produce most of the simulated climate feedback and most of its inter-model spread . The radiative feedback from a given constituent can be quantified as its impact  on the TOA net downward radiative flux per degree of global surface  temperature increase, and may be compared with the basic `black-body' response of -3.4 W m-2 C-1 . This definition assigns positive values to positive feedbacks, in keeping with the literature on this topic but contradictory to the conventions sometimes adopted in other climate research.	0
As pointed out in previous reports , physical arguments and models of all types suggest global water vapour amounts increase in a warmer climate, leading to a positive feedback via its enhanced greenhouse effect. The saturated water vapour mixing ratio  increases nearly exponentially and very rapidly with temperature, at 6 to 10% C-1 near the surface, and even more steeply aloft  where air is colder. Mounting evidence indicates that any changes in relative humidity in warmer climates would have much less impact on specific humidity than the above increases, at least in a global and statistical sense. Hence the overall WVMR is expected to increase at a rate similar to the saturated WVMR.	0
Some studies have proposed that the response of upper-level humidity to natural fluctuations in the global mean surface temperature is informative about the feedback. However, small changes to the global mean  involve geographically heterogeneous temperature change patterns, the responses to which may be a poor analogue for global warming . Most climate models reproduce these natural responses reasonably well , providing additional evidence that they at least represent the key processes. The `last-saturation' concept approximates the WVMR of air by its saturation value when it was last in a cloud , which can be inferred from trajectory analysis. Studies since the AR4 using a variety of models and observations  support this concept . The concept has clarified what determines relative humidity in the subtropical upper troposphere and placed the water vapour feedback on firmer theoretical footing by directly linking actual and saturation WVMR values . CRMs show that convection can adopt varying degrees of self-aggregation , which could modify the water vapour or other feedbacks if this were climate sensitive, although observations do not suggest aggregation changes have a large net radiative effect . In a warmer climate, an upward shift of the tropopause and poleward shift of the jets and associated climate zones are expected  and simulated by most GCMs . These changes account, at least qualitatively, for robust regional changes in the relative humidity simulated in warmer climate by GCMs, including decreases in the subtropical troposphere and tropical uppermost troposphere, and increases near the extratropical tropopause and high latitudes . This pattern may be amplified, however, by non-uniform atmospheric temperature or wind changes . It is also the apparent cause of most model-predicted changes in mid- and upper-level cloudiness patterns . Idealized CRM simulations of warming climates also show upward shifts of the humidity patterns with little change in the mean . It remains unclear whether stratospheric water vapour contributes significantly to climate feedback. Observations have shown decadal variations in stratospheric water vapour, which may have affected the planetary radiation budget somewhat  but are not clearly linked to global temperature (Section 3.4.2.4 in Trenberth et	0
7.2.4.2 Relationship Between Water Vapour and Lapse Rate Feedbacks The lapse rate  should, in the tropics, change roughly as predicted by a moist adiabat, due to the strong restoring influence of convective heating. This restoring influence has now been directly inferred from satellite data , and the near-constancy of tropical atmospheric stability and deep-convective thresholds over recent decades is also now observable in SST and deep convective data . The stronger warming of the atmosphere relative to the surface produces a negative feedback on global temperature because the warmed system radiates more thermal emission to space for a given increase in surface temperature than in the reference case where the lapse rate is fixed. This feedback varies somewhat among models because lapse rates in middle and high latitudes, which decrease less than in the tropics, do so differently among models . As shown by Cess  and discussed in the AR4 , models with a more negative lapse rate feedback tend to have a more positive water vapour feedback. Cancellation between these is close enough that their sum has a 90% range in CMIP3 models of only +0.96 to +1.22 W m-2 C-1 , see Figure 7.9) with essentially the same range in CMIP5 . The physical reason for this cancellation is that as long as water vapour infrared absorption bands are nearly saturated, outgoing longwave radiation is determined by relative humidity  which exhibits little global systematic change in any model . In fact, Held and Shell  and Ingram  argue that it makes more sense physically to redefine feedbacks in a different analysis framework in which relative humidity,	0

At left is shown the total radiative response including the Planck response. In the darker shaded region is shown the traditional breakdown of this into a Planck response and individual feedbacks from water vapour  and lapse rate .

In this framework all three components are both weaker and more consistent among the models. 	0
rather than specific humidity, is the feedback variable. Analysed in that framework the inherent stabilization by the Planck response is weaker, but the water vapour and lapse rate feedbacks are also very small; thus the traditional view of large and partially compensating feedbacks has, arguably, arisen from arbitrary choices made when the analysis framework was originally set out, rather than being an intrinsic feature of climate or climate models. There is some observational evidence  suggesting tropical lapse rates might have increased in recent decades in a way not simulated by models . Because the combined lapse rate and water vapour feedback depends on relative humidity change, however, the imputed lapse rate variations would have little influence on the total feedback or climate sensitivity even if they were a real warming response . In summary, there is increased evidence for a strong, positive feedback  from the combination of water vapour and lapse rate changes since AR4, with no reliable contradictory evidence.	0
The dominant source of spread among GCM climate sensitivities in AR4 was due to diverging cloud feedbacks, particularly due to low clouds, and this continues to be true . All global models continue to produce a near-zero to moderately strong positive net cloud feedback. Progress has been made since the AR4 in understanding the reasons for positive feedbacks in models and providing a stronger theoretical and observational basis for some mechanisms contributing to them. There has also been progress in quantifying feedbacks--including separating the effects of different cloud types, using radiative-kernel residual methods  and by computing cloud effects directly --and in distinguishing between feedback and adjustment responses . Until very recently cloud feedbacks have been diagnosed in models by differencing cloud radiative effects in doubled CO2 and control climates, normalized by the change in global mean surface temperature. Different diagnosis methods do not always agree, and some simple methods can make positive cloud feedbacks look negative by failing to account for the nonlinear interaction between cloud and water vapour . Moreover, it is now recognized that some of the cloud changes are induced directly by the atmospheric radiative effects of CO2 independently of surface warming, and are therefore rapid adjustments rather than feedbacks . Most of the published studies available for this assessment did not separate these effects, and only the total response is assessed here unless otherwise noted. It appears that the adjustments are sufficiently small in most models that general conclusions regarding feedbacks are not significantly affected. Cloud changes cause both longwave  and shortwave  effects, which combine to give the overall cloud feedback or forcing adjustment. Cloud feedback studies point to five aspects of the cloud response to climate change which are distinguished here: changes in high-level cloud altitude, effects of hydrological cycle and storm track changes on cloud systems, c hanges 587	0
7.2.5.1 Feedback Mechanisms Involving the Altitude of High-Level Cloud A dominant contributor of positive cloud feedback in models is the increase in the height of deep convective outflows tentatively attributed in AR4 to the so-called `fixed anvil-temperature' mechanism . According to this mechanism, the average outflow level from tropical deep convective systems is determined in steady state by the highest point at which water vapour cools the atmosphere significantly through infrared emission; this occurs at a particular water vapour partial pressure, therefore at a similar temperature  as climate warms. A positive feedback results because, since the cloud top temperature does not keep pace with that of the troposphere, its emission to space does not increase at the rate expected for the no-feedback system. This occurs at all latitudes and has long been noted in model simulations . This mechanism, with a small modification to account for lapse rate changes, predicts roughly +0.5 W m-2 C-1 of positive longwave feedback in GCMs , compared to an overall cloud-height feedback of +0.35  W m-2 C-1 . Importantly, CRMs also reproduce this increase in cloud height .	0
compensation between their longwave and shortwave cloud radiative effects . Similar compensation can be seen in the opposing variations of these two components of the high-cloud feedback across GCMs . This might suggest that the altitude feedback could be similarly compensated. However, GCMs can reproduce the observed compensation in the present climate  without producing one under global warming. In the above-noted cloud-resolving simulations, the entire cloud field  moved upward, in accord with a general upward shift of tropospheric fields  and with drying at levels near cloud base . This supports the prediction of GCMs that the altitude feedback is not compensated by an increase in highcloud thickness or albedo. The observational record offers limited further support for the altitude increase. The global tropopause is rising as expected . Observed cloud heights change roughly as predicted with regional, seasonal and interannual changes in near-tropopause temperature structure , although these tests may not be good analogues for global warming. Davies and Molloy  report an apparent recent downward mean cloud height trend but this is probably an artefact ; observed cloud height trends do not appear sufficiently reliable to test this cloud-height feedback mechanism . In summary, the consistency of GCM responses, basic understanding, strong support from process models, and weak further support from observations give us high confidence in a positive feedback contribution from increases in high-cloud altitude.	0

The net feedback parameters are broken down in their longwave  and shortwave  components. Type attribution reported for CMIP3 does not conform exactly to the definition used in the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project  but is shown for comparison, with their `mixed' category assigned to middle cloud.

As noted in Section 7.2.5.1, models simulate a range of nearly compensating differences in shortwave and longwave high-cloud feedbacks, consistent with different changes in high-cloud amount, but also show a net positive offset consistent with higher cloud altitude . However, there is a tendency in most GCMs toward reduced middle and high cloud amount in warmer climates in low- and mid-latitudes, especially in the subtropics . This loss of cloud amount adds a positive shortwave and negative longwave feedback to the model average, which causes the average net positive feedback to appear to come from the shortwave part of the spectrum. The net effect of changes in amount of all cloud types averaged over models is a positive feedback of about +0.2 W m-2 C-1, but this roughly matches the contribution from low clouds , implying a near-cancellation of longwave and shortwave effects for the mid- and high-level amount changes. Changes in predicted cloud cover geographically correlate with simulated subtropical drying , suggesting that they are partly tied to large-scale circulation changes including the poleward shifts found in most models . Bender et al.  and Eastman and Warren  report poleward shifts in cloud since the 1970s	0
The modelled response of low clouds does not appear to be dominated by a single feedback mechanism, but rather the net effect of several potentially competing mechanisms as elucidated in LES and GCM sensitivity studies . Starting with some proposed negative feedback mechanisms, it has been argued that in a warmer climate, The upward mass flux in deep clouds should decrease in a warmer low clouds will be:  horizontally more extensive, because changes climate , which might contribute to cloudiness decreases in the lapse rate of temperature also modify the lower-tropospheric in storm tracks or the ITCZ ;  optically thicker, because adiabatic ascent 2006).

7.2.5.4 Feedbacks Involving Changes in Cloud Opacity It has long been suggested that cloud water content could increase in a warmer climate simply due to the availability of more vapour for condensation in a warmer atmosphere, yielding a negative feedback , but this argument ignores the physics of crucial cloud-regulating processes such as precipitation formation and turbulence. Observational evidence discounting a large effect of this kind was reported in AR4 . The global mean net feedback from cloud opacity changes in CFMIP models  is approximately zero. Optical depths tend to reduce slightly at low and middle latitudes, but increase poleward of 50, yielding a positive longwave feedback that roughly offsets the negative shortwave feedback. These latitude-dependent opacity changes may be attributed to phase changes at high latitudes and greater poleward moisture transport , and possibly to poleward shifts of the circulation. Studies have reported warming-related changes in cloud opacity tied to cloud phase . This might be expected to cause negative feedback, because at mixedphase temperatures of -38 to 0C, cloud ice particles have typical diameters of 10 to 100 m , several-fold larger than cloud water drops, so a given mass of cloud water would have less surface area and reflect less sunlight in ice form than in liquid form. As climate warms, a shift from ice to liquid at a given location could increase cloud opacity. An offsetting factor that may explain the absence of this in CFMIP, however, is that mixed-phase clouds may form at higher altitudes, and similar local temperatures, in warmer climates . The key physics is in any case not adequately represented in climate models. Thus this particular feedback mechanism is highly uncertain.	0
stimulates cloud formation by boundary-layer convection . Kay et al.  show that a GCM can represent this seasonal sensitivity of low cloud to open water, but doing so depends on the details of how boundary-layer clouds are parameterized. Vavrus et al.  show that in a global warming scenario, GCMs simulate more Arctic low cloud in all seasons, but especially during autumn and the onset of winter when open water and very thin sea ice increase considerably, increasing upward moisture transport to the clouds. A few studies in the literature suggest negative feedbacks from Arctic clouds, based on spatial correlations of observed warming and cloudiness  or tree-ring proxies of cloud shortwave effects over the last millenium . However, the spatial correlations are not reliable indicators of feedback , and the tree-ring evidence  applies only to the shortwave effect of summertime cloud cover. The GCM studies would be consistent with warmer climates being cloudier, but have opposite radiative effects and positive feedback during the rest of the year. Even though a small positive feedback is suggested by models, there is overall little evidence for significant feedbacks from Arctic cloud.	0
7.2.5.6 Rapid Adjustments of Clouds to a Carbon Dioxide Change It is possible to partition the response of TOA radiation in GCMs to an instantaneous doubling of CO2 into a `rapid adjustment' in which the land surface, atmospheric circulations and clouds respond to the radiative effect of the CO2 increase, and an `SST-mediated' response that develops more slowly as the oceans warm . This distinction is important not only to help understand model processes, but because the presence of rapid adjustments would cause clouds to respond slightly differently to a transient climate change  or to a climate change caused by other forcings, than they would to the same warming at equilibrium driven by CO2. There is also a rapid adjustment of the hydrological cycle and precipitation field, discussed in Section 7.6.3. Gregory and Webb  reported that in some climate models, rapid adjustment of clouds can have TOA radiative effects comparable to those of the ensuing SST-mediated cloud changes, though Andrews and Forster  found a smaller effect. Subsequent studies using more accurate kernel-based techniques find a cloud adjustment of roughly +0.4 to +0.5 W m-2 per doubling of CO2, with standard deviation of about 0.3 W m-2 across models . This would account for about 20% of the overall cloud response in a model with average sensitivity; and because it is not strongly correlated with model sensitivity, it contributes perhaps 20% of the inter-model response spread , which therefore remains dominated by feedbacks. The response occurs due to a general decrease in cloud cover caused by the slight stratification driven by CO2 warming of the troposphere, which especially for middle and low clouds has a net warming effect . As explained at the beginning of Section 7.2.5, feedback numbers given in this report already account for these rapid adjustments.	0
7.2.5.7 Observational Constraints on Global Cloud Feedback A number of studies since AR4 have attempted to constrain overall cloud feedback  from observations of natural climate variability; here we discuss those using modern cloud, radiation or other measurements . One approach is to seek observable aspects of present-day cloud behaviour that reveal cloud feedback or some component thereof. Varying parameters in a GCM sometimes produces changes in cloud feedback that correlate with the properties of cloud simulated for the present day, but this depends on the GCM , and the resulting relationships do not hold across multiple models such as those from CMIP3 . Among the AR4 models, net cloud feedback correlates strongly with mid-latitude relative humidity , with TOA radiation at high southern latitudes , and with humidity at certain latitudes during boreal summer ; if valid each of these regression relations would imply a relatively strong positive cloud feedback in reality, but no mechanism has been proposed to explain or validate them and such apparent skill can arise fortuitously . Likewise, Clement et al.  found realistic decadal variations of cloud cover over the North Pacific in only one model  and argued that the relatively strong cloud feedback in this model should therefore be regarded as more likely, but this finding lacks a mechanistic explanation and may depend on how model output is used . Chang and Coakley  examined mid-latitude maritime clouds and found cloud thinning with increasing temperature, consistent with a positive feedback, whereas Gordon and Norris  found the opposite result following a methodology that tried to isolate thermal and advective effects. In summary, there is no evidence of a robust link between any of the noted observables and the global feedback, though some apparent connections are tantalizing and are being studied further. Several studies have attempted to derive global climate sensitivity from interannual relationships between global mean observations of TOA radiation and surface temperature . One problem with this is the different spatial character of interannual and long-term warming; another is that the methodology can be confounded by cloud variations not caused by those of surface temperature . A range of climate sensitivities has been inferred based on such analyses . Crucially, however, among different GCMs there is no correlation between the interannual and long-term cloud- temperature relationships , contradicting the basic assumption of these methods. Many but not all atmosphere-ocean GCMs predict relationships that are consistent with observations . More recently there is interest in relating the time-lagged correlations of cloud and temperature to feedback processes  but again these relationships appear to reveal only a model's ability to simulate ENSO or other modes of interannual variability properly, which are not obviously informative about the cloud feedback on long-term global warming .	0
For a putative observational constraint on climate sensitivity to be accepted, it should have a sound physical basis and its assumptions should be tested appropriately in climate models. No method yet proposed meets both conditions. Moreover, cloud responses to warming can be sensitive to relatively subtle details in the geographic warming pattern, such as the slight hemispheric asymmetry due to the lag of southern ocean warming relative to northern latitudes . Cloud responses to specified uniform ocean warming without CO2 increases are not the same as those to CO2-induced global warming simulated with more realistic oceans , partly because of rapid adjustments  and because low clouds also feed back tightly to the underlying surface . Simulated cloud feedbacks also differ significantly between colder and warmer climates in some models  and between volcanic and other forcings . These sensitivities highlight the challenges facing any attempt to infer long-term cloud feedbacks from simple data analyses.	0
Together, the water vapour, lapse rate and cloud feedbacks are the principal determinants of equilibrium climate sensitivity. The water vapour and lapse rate feedbacks, as traditionally defined, should be thought of as a single phenomenon rather than in isolation . To estimate a 90% probability range for that feedback, we double the variance of GCM results about the mean to account for the possibility of errors common to all models, to arrive at +1.1  W m-2 C-1. Values in this range are supported by a steadily growing body of observational evidence, model tests, and physical reasoning. As a corollary, the net feedback from water vapour and lapse rate changes combined is extremely likely positive, allowing for the possibility of deep uncertainties or a fat-tailed error distribution. Key aspects of the responses of water vapour and clouds to climate warming now appear to be constrained by large-scale dynamical mechanisms that are not sensitive to poorly represented small-scale processes, and as such, are more credible. This feedback is thus known to be positive with high confidence, and contributes only a small part of the spread in GCM climate sensitivity . An alternative framework has recently been proposed in which these feedbacks, and stabilization via thermal emission, are all significantly smaller and more consistent among models; thus the range given above may overstate the true uncertainty. Several cloud feedback mechanisms now appear consistently in GCMs, summarized in Figure 7.11, most supported by other lines of evidence. Nearly all act in a positive direction. First, high clouds are expected to rise in altitude and thereby exert a stronger greenhouse effect in warmer climates. This altitude feedback mechanism is well understood, has theoretical and observational support, occurs consistently in GCMs and CRMs and explains about half of the mean positive cloud feedback in GCMs. Second, middle and high-level cloud cover tends to decrease in warmer climates even within the ITCZ, although the feedback effect of this is ambiguous and it cannot yet be tested observationally. Third, observations and most models suggest storm tracks shift poleward in a warmer climate, drying the subtropics and moistening the high latitudes, which causes further positive feedback via a net shift of cloud cover to latitudes that receive less sunshine. Finally, most GCMs also 591	0
Figure 7.11 | Robust cloud responses to greenhouse warming . The tropopause and melting level are shown by the thick solid and thin grey dashed lines, respectively. Changes anticipated in a warmer climate are shown by arrows, with red colour indicating those making a robust positive feedback contribution and grey indicating those where the feedback contribution is small and/or highly uncertain. No robust mechanisms contribute negative feedback. Changes include rising high cloud tops and melting level, and increased polar cloud cover and/or optical thickness ; broadening of the Hadley Cell and/or poleward migration of storm tracks, and narrowing of rainfall zones such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone ; and reduced low-cloud amount and/or optical thickness . Confidence assessments are based on degree of GCM consensus, strength of independent lines of evidence from observations or process models and degree of basic understanding.	0
Currently, neither cloud process models  nor observations provide clear evidence to contradict or confirm feedback mechanisms involving low clouds. In some cases these models show stronger low-cloud feedbacks than GCMs, but each model type has limitations, and some studies suggest stronger positive feedbacks are more realistic . Cloud process models suggest a variety of potentially opposing response mechanisms that may account for the current spread of GCM feedbacks. In summary we find no evidence to contradict either the cloud or water vapour-lapse rate feedback ranges shown by current GCMs, although the many uncertainties mean that true feedback could still lie outside these ranges. In particular, microphysical mechanisms affecting cloud opacity or cirrus amount may well be missing from GCMs. Missing feedbacks, if any, could act in either direction.	0
Based on the preceding synthesis of cloud behaviour, the net radiative feedback due to all cloud types is judged likely to be positive. This is reasoned probabilistically as follows. First, because evidence from observations and process models is mixed as to whether GCM cloud feedback is too strong or too weak overall, and because the positive feedback found in GCMs comes mostly from mechanisms now supported by other lines of evidence, the central  estimate of the total cloud feedback is taken as the mean from GCMs . Second, because there is no accepted basis to discredit individual GCMs a priori, the probability distribution of the true feedback cannot be any narrower than the distribution of GCM results. Third, since feedback mechanisms are probably missing from GCMs and some CRMs suggest feedbacks outside the range in GCMs, the probable range of	0
FAQ 7.1 | How Do Clouds Affect Climate and Climate Change? Clouds strongly affect the current climate, but observations alone cannot yet tell us how they will affect a future, warmer climate. Comprehensive prediction of changes in cloudiness requires a global climate model. Such models simulate cloud fields that roughly resemble those observed, but important errors and uncertainties remain. Different climate models produce different projections of how clouds will change in a warmer climate. Based on all available evidence, it seems likely that the net cloud-climate feedback amplifies global warming. If so, the strength of this amplification remains uncertain. Since the 1970s, scientists have recognized the critical importance of clouds for the climate system, and for climate change. Clouds affect the climate system in a variety of ways. They produce precipitation  that is necessary for most life on land. They warm the atmosphere as water vapour condenses. Although some of the condensed water re-evaporates, the precipitation that reaches the surface represents a net warming of the air. Clouds strongly affect the flows of both sunlight  and infrared light  through the atmosphere. Finally, clouds contain powerful updraughts that can rapidly carry air from near the surface to great heights. The updraughts carry energy, moisture, momentum, trace gases, and aerosol particles. For decades, climate scientists have been using both observations and models to study how clouds change with the daily weather, with the seasonal cycle, and with year-to-year changes such as those associated with El Nino. All cloud processes have the potential to change as the climate state changes. Cloud feedbacks are of intense interest in the context of climate change. Any change in a cloud process that is caused by climate change--and in turn influences climate--represents a cloud-climate feedback. Because clouds interact so strongly with both sunlight and infrared light, small changes in cloudiness can have a potent effect on the climate system. Many possible types of cloud-climate feedbacks have been suggested, involving changes in cloud amount, cloudtop height and/or cloud reflectivity . The literature shows consistently that high clouds amplify global warming as they interact with infrared light emitted by the atmosphere and surface. There is more uncertainty, however, about the feedbacks associated with low-altitude clouds, and about cloud feedbacks associated with amount and reflectivity in general. Thick high clouds efficiently reflect sunlight, and both thick and thin high clouds strongly reduce the amount of infrared light that the atmosphere and surface emit to space. The compensation between these two effects makes 	0
the surface temperature somewhat less sensitive to changes in high cloud amount than to changes in low cloud amount. This compensation could be disturbed if there were a systematic shift from thick high cloud to thin cirrus cloud or vice versa; while this possibility cannot be ruled out, it is not currently supported by any evidence. On the other hand, changes in the altitude of high clouds  can strongly affect surface temperature. An upward shift in high clouds reduces the infrared light that the surface and atmosphere emit to space, but has little effect on the reflected sunlight. There is strong evidence of such a shift in a warmer climate. This amplifies global warming by preventing some of the additional infrared light emitted by the atmosphere and surface from leaving the climate system. Low clouds reflect a lot of sunlight back to space but, for a given state of the atmosphere and surface, they have only a weak effect on the infrared light that is emitted to space by the Earth. As a result, they have a net cooling effect on the present climate; to a lesser extent, the same holds for mid-level clouds. In a future climate warmed by increasing greenhouse gases, most IPCC-assessed climate models simulate a decrease in low and mid-level cloud amount, which would increase the absorption of sunlight and so tend to increase the warming. The extent of this decrease is quite model-dependent, however. There are also other ways that clouds may change in a warmer climate. Changes in wind patterns and storm tracks could affect the regional and seasonal patterns of cloudiness and precipitation. Some studies suggest that the signal of one such trend seen in climate models--a poleward migration of the clouds associated with mid-latitude storm tracks--is already detectable in the observational record. By shifting clouds into regions receiving less sunlight, this could also amplify global warming. More clouds may be made of liquid drops, which are small but numerous and reflect more sunlight back to space than a cloud composed of the same mass of larger ice crystals. Thin cirrus cloud, which exerts a net warming effect and is very hard for climate models to simulate, could change in ways not simulated by models although there is no evidence for this. Other processes may be regionally important, for example, interactions between clouds and the surface can change over the ocean where sea ice melts, and over land where plant transpiration is reduced. There is as yet no broadly accepted way to infer global cloud feedbacks from observations of long-term cloud trends or shorter-time scale variability. Nevertheless, all the models used for the current assessment  produce net cloud feedbacks that either enhance anthropogenic greenhouse warming or have little overall effect. Feedbacks are not `put into' the models, but emerge from the functioning of the clouds in the simulated atmosphere and their effects on the flows and transformations of energy in the climate system. The differences in the strengths of the cloud feedbacks produced by the various models largely account for the different sensitivities of the models to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations.	0
Forster et al.  quoted Sausen et al.  to update the 2000 forcing for aviation-induced cirrus  to +0.03  W m-2 but did not consider this to be a best estimate because of large uncertainties. Schumann and Graf  constrained their model with observations of the diurnal cycle of contrails and cirrus in a region with high air traffic relative to a region with little air traffic, and estimated a RF of +0.05  W m-2 for contrails and contrail-induced cirrus in 2006, but their model has a large shortwave contribution, and larger estimates are possible. An alternative approach was taken by Burkhardt and Karcher , who estimated a global RF for 2002 of +0.03 W m-2 from contrails and contrail cirrus within a climate model , after compensating for reduced background cirrus cloudiness in the main traffic areas. Based on these two studies we assess the combined contrail and contrail-induced cirrus ERF for the year 2011 to be +0.05  W m-2 to take into uncertainties on spreading rate, optical depth, ice particle shape and radiative transfer and the ongoing increase in air traffic . A low confidence is attached to this estimate.	0
7.2.7.2 Irrigation-Induced Cloudiness Boucher et al.  estimated a global ERF due to water vapour from irrigation in the range of +0.03 to +0.10 W m-2 but the net climate effect was dominated by the evaporative cooling at the surface and by atmospheric thermal responses to low-level humidification. Regional surface cooling was confirmed by a number of more recent regional and global studies . The resulting increase in water vapour may induce a small enhancement in precipitation downwind of the major irrigation areas , as well as some regional circulation patterns . Sacks et al.  reported a 0.001 increase in cloud fraction over land . This suggests an ERF no more negative than -0.1 W m-2 with very low confidence.	0
and formation of secondary particulate matter from gaseous precursors . The main constituents of the atmospheric aerosol are inorganic species , organic species , black carbon , mineral species  and primary biological aerosol particles . Mineral dust, sea salt, BC and PBAPs are introduced into the atmosphere as primary particles, whereas non-seasalt sulphate, nitrate and ammonium are predominantly from secondary aerosol formation processes. The OA has both significant primary and secondary sources. In the present-day atmosphere, the majority of BC, sulphate, nitrate and ammonium come from anthropogenic sources, whereas sea salt, most mineral dust and PBAPs are predominantly of natural origin. Primary and secondary organic aerosols  are influenced by both natural and anthropogenic sources. Emission rates of aerosols and aerosol precursors are summarized in Table 7.1. The characteristics and role of the main aerosol species are listed in Table 7.2.	0

of the main aerosol types can be constructed from such measurements . Such analyses show a wide spatial variability in aerosol mass concentration, dominant aerosol type, and aerosol composition. Mineral dust dominates the aerosol mass over some continental regions with relatively higher concentrations especially in urban South Asia and China, accounting for about 35% of the total aerosol mass with diameter smaller than 10 mm. In the urban North America and South America, organic carbon  contributes the largest mass fraction to the atmospheric aerosol , while in other areas of the world the OC fraction ranks second or third with a mean of about 16%. Sulphate normally accounts for about 10 to 30% by mass, except for the areas in rural Africa, urban Oceania and South America, where it is less than about 10%. The mass fractions of nitrate and ammonium are only around 6% and 4% on average, respectively. In most areas, elemental carbon  represents less than 5% of the aerosol mass, although this percentage may be larger  in South America, urban Africa, urban Europe, South, Southeast and East Asia and urban Oceania due to the larger impact of combustion sources. Sea salt can be dominant at oceanic remote sites with 50 to 70% of aerosol mass. Aerosol optical depth , which is related to the column-integrated aerosol amount, is measured by the Aerosol Robotic Network , other ground-based networks (e.g.,	0
Bokoye et al., 2001; Che et al., 2009) and a number of satellite-based sensors. Instruments designed for aerosol retrievals such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer , Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer  and Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances /Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences Coupled with Observations from Lidar   are used preferentially to less specialized instruments such as Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer , Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer  and Along Track Scanning Radiometer /Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer   although the latter are useful for building aerosol climatologies because of their long measurement records . Although each AOD retrieval by satellite sensors shows some skill against more accurate sunphotometer measurements such as those of AERONET, there are still large differences among satellite products in regional and seasonal patterns because of differences and uncertainties in calibration, sampling, cloud screening, treatment of the surface reflectivity and aerosol microphysical properties . The global but incomplete sampling of satellite measurements	0
can be combined with information from global aerosol models through data assimilation techniques . Owing to the heterogeneity in their sources, their short lifetime and the dependence of sinks on the meteorology, aerosol distributions show large variations on daily, seasonal and interannual scales. The CALIPSO spaceborne lidar  complements existing ground-based lidars. It now provides a climatology of the aerosol extinction coefficient , highlighting that over most regions the majority of the optically active aerosol resides in the lowest 1 to 2 km. Yu et al.  and Koffi et al.  found that global aerosol models tend to have a positive bias in the aerosol extinction scale height in some  regions, due to an overestimate of aerosol concentrations above 6 km. There is less information available on the vertical profile of aerosol number and mass concentrations, although a number of field experiments involving research and commercial aircraft have measured aerosol concentrations .

wind speed, sea state and atmospheric stability, and to a lesser extent on the temperature and composition of the sea water. Our understanding of sea spray emissions has increased substantially since AR4; however, process-based estimates of the total mass and size distribution of emitted sea spray particles continue to have large uncertainties . Sea spray particles are composed of sea salt and marine primary organic matter, the latter being found preferentially in particles smaller than 200 nm in diameter . The emission rate of marine POA depends on biological activity in ocean waters  and its global emission rate has been estimated to be in the range 2 to 20 Tg yr-1 . Uncertainty in the source and composition of sea spray translates into a significant uncertainty in the aerosol number concentration in the marine atmosphere that, unlike aerosol optical depth and mass concentrations, can only be constrained by in situ observations . 600	0
Mineral dust particles are produced mainly by disintegration of aggregates following creeping and saltation of larger soil particles over desert and other arid surfaces . The magnitude of dust emissions to the atmosphere depends on the surface wind speed and many soil-related factors such as its texture, moisture and vegetation cover. The range of estimates for the global dust emissions spans a factor of about five . Anthropogenic sources, including road dust and mineral dust due to human land use change, remain ill quantified although some recent satellite observations suggest the fraction of mineral dust due to the latter source could be 20 to 25% of the total . The sources of biomass burning aerosols at the global scale are usually inferred from satellite retrieval of burned areas and/or active fires, but inventories continue to suffer from the lack of sensitivity of satellite	0
data to small fires  and uncertainties in emission factors. Terrestrial sources of PBAPs include bacteria, pollen, fungal spores, lichen, viruses and fragments of animals and plants . Most of these particles are emitted in the coarse mode  and the contribution to the accumulation mode is thought to be small. There are only a few estimates of the global flux of PBAPs and these are poorly constrained . The main natural aerosol precursors are dimethylsulphide  emitted by the oceans and biogenic volatile organic compounds  emitted mainly by the terrestrial biosphere. BVOC emissions depend on the amount and type of vegetation, temperature, radiation, the ambient CO2 concentration and soil humidity . While speciated BVOC emission inventories have been derived for some continental regions, global emission inventories or schemes are available only for isoprene, monoterpenes and a few other compounds . The total global BVOC emissions have large uncertainties, despite the apparent convergence in different model-based estimates . The ratio of secondary to primary organic aerosol is larger than previously thought, but has remained somewhat ambiguous due to atmospheric transformation processes affecting both these components . Globally, most of the atmospheric SOA is expected to originate from biogenic sources, even though anthropogenic sources could be equally important at northern mid-latitudes . Recent studies suggest that the SOA formation from BVOCs may be enhanced substantially by anthropogenic pollution due to  high concentrations of nitrogen oxides  enhancing BVOC oxidation, and  high anthropogenic POA concentrations that facilitate transformation of oxidized volatile organic compounds  to the particle phase . The uncertainty range of atmospheric SOA formation is still large and estimated to be approximately 20 to 380 Tg yr-1 . Anthropogenic sources of aerosol particles  and aerosol precursors  can be inferred from a priori emission inventories . They are generally better constrained than natural sources, exceptions being anthropogenic sources of BC, which could be underestimated , and anthropogenic emissions of some VOCs, fly-ash and dust which are still poorly known. Since AR4, remote sensing by satellites has been increasingly used to constrain natural and anthropogenic aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions .	0
aerosol particles. Since AR4, substantial progress in our understanding of atmospheric nucleation and new particle formation has been made . Multiple lines of evidence indicate that while sulphuric acid is the main driver of nucleation , the nucleation rate is affected by ammonia and amines  as well as low-volatility organic vapours . Nucleation pathways involving only uncharged molecules are expected to dominate over nucleation induced by ionization of atmospheric molecules in continental boundary layers, but the situation might be different in the free atmosphere . Condensation is the main process transferring low-volatility vapours to aerosol particles, and also usually the dominant process for growth to larger sizes. The growth of the smallest particles depends crucially on the condensation of organic vapours  and is therefore tied strongly with atmospheric SOA formation discussed in Section 7.3.3.1. The treatment of condensation of semi-volatile compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid and most organic vapours, remains a challenge in climate modeling. In addition, small aerosol particles collide with one another and stick , one of the processes contributing to aerosol internal mixing. Coagulation is an important sink for sub-micrometre size particles, typically under high concentrations near sources and at lower concentrations in locations where the aerosol lifetime is long and amount of condensable vapours is low. It is the main sink for the smallest aerosol particles . Since AR4, observations of atmospheric nucleation and subsequent growth of nucleated particles to larger sizes have been increasingly reported in different atmospheric environments . Nucleation and growth enhance atmospheric CCN concentrations  and potentially affect aerosol-cloud interactions . However, CCN concentrations may be fairly insensitive to changes in nucleation rate because the growth of nucleated particles to larger sizes is limited by coagulation . Aerosols also evolve due to cloud processing, followed by the aerosol release upon evaporation of cloud particles, affecting the number concentration, composition, size and mixing state of atmospheric aerosol particles. This occurs via aqueous-phase chemistry taking place inside clouds, via altering aerosol precursor chemistry around and below clouds, and via different aerosol-hydrometeor interactions. These processes are discussed further in Section 7.4.1.2. The understanding and modelling of aerosol sinks has seen less progress since AR4 in comparison to other aerosol processes. Improved dry deposition models, which depend on the particle size as well as the characteristics of the Earth's surface, have been developed and are increasingly being used in global aerosol models . Sedimentation throughout the atmosphere and its role in dry deposition at the surface are important for the largest particles in the coarse mode. The uncertainty in 601	0
The climate effects of atmospheric aerosol particles depend on their atmospheric distribution, along with their hygroscopicity, optical properties and ability to act as CCN and IN. Key quantities for aerosol optical and cloud forming properties are the particle number size distribution, chemical composition, mixing state and morphology. These properties are determined by a complex interplay between their sources, atmospheric transformation processes and their removal from the atmosphere . Since AR4, measurement of some of the key aerosol properties has been greatly improved in laboratory and field experiments using advanced instrumentation, which allows for instance the analysis of individual particles. These experimental studies have in turn stimulated improvement in the model representations of the aerosol physical, chemical and optical properties . We focus our assessment on some of the key issues where there has been progress since AR4.	0
Formation processes of OA still remain highly uncertain, which is a major weakness in the present understanding and model representation of atmospheric aerosols . Measurements by aerosol mass spectrometers have provided some insights into sources and atmospheric processing of OA . Observations at continental mid-latitudes including urban and rural/remote air suggest that the majority of SOA is probably oxygenated OA . Experiments within and downstream of urban air indicate that under most circumstances SOA substantially contributes to the total OA mass . There is a large range in the complexity with which OA is represented in global aerosol models. Some complex, yet still parameterized, chemical schemes have been developed recently that account for multigenerational oxidation . Since AR4, some regional and global model have used a new scheme based on lumping VOCs into volatility bins , which is an improved representation of the two-product absorptive partitioning scheme  for the formation and aging of SOA. This new framework includes organic compounds of different volatility, produced from parent VOCs by multi-generation oxidation processes and partitioned between the aerosol and gas phases , which improves the agreement between observed and modeled SOA in urban areas . Field observations and laboratory studies suggest that OA is also formed efficiently in aerosol and cloud and liquid water contributing a substantial fraction of the organic aerosol mass . Chemical reactions in the aerosol phase  also make OA less volatile and more hygroscopic, influencing aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions . As a consequence, OA concentrations are probably underestimated in many global aerosol models that do not include these chemical processes . Some of the OA is light absorbing and can be referred to as brown carbon . A fraction of the SOA formed in cloud and aerosol water is lightabsorbing in the visible , while SOA produced from gas-phase oxidation of VOCs absorbs ultraviolet radiation . Multiple observations show co-existence of external and internal mixtures relatively soon after emission . In biomass burning aerosol, organic compounds and BC are frequently internally mixed with ammonium, nitrate, and sulphate . Over urban locations, as much as 90% of the particles are internally mixed with secondary inorganic species . Likewise mineral dust and biomass burning aerosols can become internally mixed when these aerosol types age together . The aerosol mixing state can alter particle size distribution and hygroscopicity and hence the aerosol optical properties and ability to act as CCN . Global aerosol models can now approximate	0
7.3.3.2 Size Distribution and Optical Properties Aerosol size distribution is a key parameter determining both the aerosol optical and CCN properties. Since the AR4, much effort has been put into measuring and simulating the aerosol number rather than volume size distribution. For instance, number size distributions in the submicron range  were measured at 24 sites in Europe for two years , although systematic measurements are still limited in other regions. Although validation studies show agreement between column-averaged volume size distribution from sunphotometer measurements and direct in situ  measurements at some locations , these inversion products have not been systematically validated. Satellite measurements produce valuable but more limited information on aerosol size. The aerosol scattering, absorption and extinction coefficients depend on the aerosol size distribution, aerosol refractive index and mixing state. The humidification of internally mixed aerosols further influences their light scattering and absorption properties, through changes in particle shape, size and refractive index . Aerosol absorption is a key climate-relevant aerosol property and earlier in situ methods to measure it suffered from significant uncertainties , partly due to the lack of proper reference material for instrument calibration and development . Recent measurements using photo-acoustic methods and laser-induced incandescence methods are more accurate but remain sparse. The mass absorption cross sections for freshly generated BC were measured to be 7.5  1.2 m2 g-1 at 550 nm . Laboratory measurements conducted under well controlled conditions show that thick coating of soluble material over BC cores enhance the mass absorption cross section by a factor of 1.8 to 2 . It is more difficult to measure the enhancement factor in mass absorption cross sections for ambient BC, partly owing to the necessity of removing coatings of BC. Knox et al.  observed enhancement by a factor 1.2 to 1.6 near source regions. A much lower enhancement factor was observed by Cappa et al.  by a new measurement technique, in contradiction to the laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations. These results may not be representative and would require confirmation by independent measurement methods. As discussed in Section 7.3.1.2, the global mean AOD is not well constrained from satellite-based measurements and remains a significant source of uncertainty when estimating aerosol-radiation interactions . This is also true of the anthropogenic fraction of AOD which is more difficult to constrain from observations. AeroCom phase II models simulate an anthropogenic AOD at 550 nm of 0.03  0.01  relative to 1850, which represents 24  6% of the total AOD . This is less than suggested by some satellite-based studies, i.e., 0.03 over the ocean only in Kaufman et al. , and about 0.06 as a global average in Loeb and Su  and Bellouin et al. , but more than in the CMIP5 models . Overall there	0
7.3.3.3 Cloud Condensation Nuclei A subset of aerosol particles acts as CCN . The ability of an aerosol particle to take up water and subsequently activate, thereby acting as a CCN at a given supersaturation, is determined by its size and composition. Common CCN in the atmosphere are composed of sea salt, sulphates and sulphuric acid, nitrate and nitric acid and some organics. The uptake of water vapour by hygroscopic aerosols strongly affects their RFari. CCN activity of inorganic aerosols is relatively well understood, and lately most attention has been paid to the CCN activity of mixed organic/inorganic aerosols . Uncertainties in our current understanding of CCN properties are due primarily to SOA , mainly because OA is still poorly characterized . The important effect of the formation of SOA is that internally mixed SOA contributes to the mass of aerosol particles, and therefore to their sizes. The size of the CCN has been found to be more important than their chemical composition at two continental locations as larger particles are more readily activated than smaller particles because they require a lower critical supersaturation . However, the chemical composition may be important in other locations such as the marine environment, where primary organic particles  have been shown to be exceptionally good CCN . For SOA it is not clear how important surface tension effects and bulk-to-surface partitioning of surfactants are, and if the water activity coefficient changes significantly as a function of the solute concentration . The bulk hygroscopicity parameter k has been introduced as a concise measure of how effectively an aerosol particle acts as a CCN . It can be measured experimentally and is increasingly being used as a way to characterize aerosol properties. Pringle et al.  used surface and aircraft measurements to evaluate the k distributions simulated by a global aerosol model, and found generally good agreement. When the aerosol is dominated by organics, discrepancies between values of k obtained directly from both CCN activity measurements and sub-saturated particle water uptake measurements have been observed in some instances , whereas in other studies closure has been obtained . Adsorption theory  replaces k-theory for CCN activation for insoluble particles  while alternative theories are still required for explanation of marine POA that seem to have peculiar gel-like properties .	0
7.3.3.4 Ice Nuclei Aerosols that act as IN are solid substances at atmospheric temperatures and supersaturations. Mineral dust, volcanic ash and primary bioaerosols such as bacteria, fungal spores and pollen, are typically known as good IN . Conflicting evidence has been presented for the ability of BC, organic, organic semi-solid/glassy organic and biomass burning particles to act as IN . The importance of biological particles acting as IN is unclear. A new study finds evidence of a large fraction of submicron particles in the middle-to-upper troposphere to be composed of biological particles ; however global modelling studies suggest that their concentrations are not sufficient to play an important role for ice formation . Because BC has anthropogenic sources, its increase since pre-industrial times may have caused changes to the lifetime of mixed-phase clouds  and thus to RF . Four heterogeneous ice-nucleation modes are distinguished in the literature: immersion freezing , condensation freezing , contact freezing  and deposition nucleation . Lidar observations reveal that liquid cloud droplets are present before ice crystals form via heterogeneous freezing mechanisms , indicating that deposition nucleation does not seem to be important for mixed-phase clouds. IN can either be bare or mixed with other substances. As bare particles age in the atmosphere, they acquire liquid surface coatings by condensing soluble species and water vapour or by coagulating with soluble particles, which may transform IN from deposition or contact nuclei into possible immersion nuclei. A change from contact to immersion freezing implies activation at colder temperatures, with consequences for the lifetime and radiative effect of mixed-phase clouds . The atmospheric concentrations of IN are very uncertain because of the aforementioned uncertainties in freezing mechanisms and the difficulty of measuring IN in the upper troposphere. The anthropogenic fraction cannot be estimated at this point because of a lack of knowledge about the anthropogenic fractions of BC and mineral dust acting as IN and the contributions of PBAPs, other organic aerosols and other aerosols acting as IN.	0
7.3.4.1 Radiative Effects due to Aerosol-Radiation Interactions The radiative effect due to aerosol-radiation interactions , formerly known as direct radiative effect, is the change in radiative flux caused by the combined scattering and absorption of radiation by anthropogenic and natural aerosols. The REari results from wellunderstood physics and is close to being an observable quantity, yet our knowledge of aerosol and environmental characteristics needed to quantify the REari at the global scale remains incomplete . The REari requires knowledge of the spectrally varying aerosol extinction coefficient, single scattering albedo, and phase function, which can in principle be estimated from the aerosol size distribution, shape, chemical composition and mixing state . Radiative properties of the surface, atmospheric trace gases and clouds also influence the REari. In the solar spectrum under cloud-free conditions the REari is typically negative at the TOA, but it weakens and can become positive with increasing aerosol absorption, decreasing upscatter fraction or increasing albedo of the underlying surface. REari is weaker in cloudy conditions, except when the cloud layer is thin or when absorbing aerosols are located above or between clouds . The REari at the surface is negative and can be much stronger than the REari at the TOA over regions where aerosols are absorbing . In the longwave part of the spectrum, TOA REari is generally positive and mainly exerted by coarse-mode aerosols, such as sea spray and desert dust , and by stratospheric aerosols . There have been many measurement-based estimates of shortwave REari  although some studies involve some degree of modelling. In contrast, estimates of longwave REari remain limited . Observed and calculated shortwave radiative fluxes agree within measurement uncertainty when aerosol properties are known . Global observational estimates of the REari rely on satellite remote sensing of aerosol properties and/ or measurements of the Earth's radiative budget . Estimates of shortwave TOA REari annually averaged over cloud-free oceans range from -4 to -6 W m-2, mainly contributed by sea spray . However, REari can reach tens of W m-2 locally. Estimates over land are more difficult as the surface is less well characterized  despite recent progress in aerosol inversion algorithms . Attempts to estimate the REari in cloudy sky remain elusive , although passive and active remote sensing of aerosols over clouds is now possible . Notable areas of positive TOA REari exerted by absorbing aerosols include the Arctic over ice surfaces  and seasonally over southeastern Atlantic stratocumulus clouds . While AOD and aerosol size are relatively well constrained, uncertainties in the aerosol single-scattering albedo  and vertical profile  contribute significantly to the overall uncertainties in REari. Consequently,	0
7.3.4.2 Rapid Adjustments to Aerosol-Radiation Interactions Aerosol-radiation interactions give rise to rapid adjustments , which are particularly pronounced for absorbing aerosols such as BC. Associated cloud changes are often referred to as the semi-direct aerosol effect . The ERF from aerosol-radiation interactions is quantified in Section 7.5.2; only the corresponding processes governing rapid adjustments are discussed here. Impacts on precipitation are discussed in Section 7.6.3. Since AR4, additional observational studies have found correlations between cloud cover and absorbing aerosols , and eddy-resolving, regional and global scale modelling studies have helped confirm a causal link. Relationships between cloud and aerosol reveal a more complicated picture than initially anticipated . Absorbing aerosols modify atmospheric stability in the boundary layer and free troposphere . The effect of this on cloud cover depends on the height of the aerosol relative to the cloud and the type of cloud . Aerosol also reduces the downwelling solar radiation at the surface. Together the changes in atmospheric stability and reduction in surface fluxes provide a means for aerosols to significantly modify the fraction of surface-forced clouds . These changes may also affect precipitation as discussed in Section 7.6.3. Cloud cover is expected to decrease if absorbing aerosol is embedded in the cloud layer. This has been observed  and simulated  for clouds over the Amazon forest in the presence of smoke aerosols. In the stratocumulus regime, absorbing aerosol above cloud top strengthens the temperature inversion, reduces entrainment and tends to enhance cloudiness. Satellite observations  and modelling  of marine stratocumulus show a thickening of the cloud layer beneath layers of absorbing smoke aerosol, which induces a local negative forcing. The responses of other cloud types, such as those associated with deep convection, are not well determined. Absorbing aerosols embedded in cloud drops enhance their absorption, which can affect the dissipation of cloud. The contribution to RFari is small , and there is contradictory evidence regarding the magnitude of the cloud dissipation effect influencing ERFari . Global forcing estimates are necessarily based on global models , although the accuracy of GCMs in this regard is limited by their ability to represent low cloud processes accurately. This is an area of concern as discussed in Section 7.2 and limits confidence in these estimates.	0
7.3.5.1 Changes in Sea Spray and Mineral Dust Concentrations of sea spray will respond to changes in surface wind speed, atmospheric stability, precipitation and sea ice cover . Climate models disagree about the balance of effects, with estimates ranging from an overall 19% reduction in global sea salt burden from the present-day to year 2100 , to little sensitivity , to a sizeable increase . In particular there is little understanding of how surface wind speed may change over the ocean in a warmer climate, and observed recent changes  may not be indicative of future changes. Given that sea spray particles comprise a significant fraction of CCN concentrations over the oceans, such large changes will feed back on climate through changes in cloud droplet number . Studies of the effects of climate change on dust loadings also give a wide range of results. Woodward et al.  found a tripling of the dust burden in 2100 relative to present-day because of a large increase in bare soil fraction. A few studies projected moderate  increases, or decreases . Mahowald et al.  found a 60% decrease under a doubled CO2 concentration due to the effect of CO2 fertilization on vegetation. The large range reflects different responses of the atmosphere and vegetation cover to climate change forcings, and results in low confidence in these predictions.	0
7.3.5.2 Changes in Sulphate, Ammonium and Nitrate Aerosols The DMS-sulphate-cloud-climate feedback loop could operate in numerous ways through changes in temperature, absorbed solar radiation, ocean mixed layer depth and nutrient recycling, sea ice extent, wind speed, shift in marine ecosystems due to ocean acidification and climate change, and atmospheric processing of DMS into CCN. Although no study has included all the relevant effects, two decades of research have questioned the original formulation of the feedback loop  and have provided important insights into this complex, coupled system . There is now medium confidence for a weak feedback due to a weak sensitivity of the CCN population to changes in DMS emissions, based on converging evidence from observations and Earth System model simulations . Parameterizations of oceanic DMS 605	0
production nevertheless lack robust mechanistic justification  and as a result the sensitivity to ocean acidification and climate change remains uncertain . Chemical production of sulphate increases with atmospheric temperature , but future changes in sulphate are found to be more sensitive to simulated future changes in precipitation removal. Under fixed anthropogenic emissions, most studies to date predict a small  reduction in global sulphate burden mainly because of future increases in precipitation . However, Rae et al.  found a small increase in global sulphate burden from 2000 to 2100 because the simulated future precipitation was reduced in regions of high sulphate abundance. Changes in temperature have a large impact on nitrate aerosol formation through shifting gas-particle equilibria. There is some agreement among global aerosol models that climate change alone will contribute to a decrease in the nitrate concentrations  with the exception of Bauer et al.  who found little change in nitrate for year 2030. It should be noted however that these modeling studies have reported that changes in precursor emissions are expected to increase nitrate concentrations in the future . Besides the changes in meteorological parameters, climate change can also influence ammonium formation by changing concentrations of sulphate and nitrate, but the effect of climate change alone was found to be small .	0
A large fraction of SOA forms from the oxidation of isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes from biogenic sources . Emissions from vegetation can increase in a warmer atmosphere, everything else being constant . Global aerosol models simulate an increase in isoprene emissions of 22 to 55% by 2100 in response to temperature change  and a change in global SOA burden of -6% to +100% through climate-induced changes in aerosol processes and removal rates . An observationally based study suggest a small global feedback parameter of -0.01 W m-2 C-1 despite larger regional effects . Increasing CO2 concentrations, drought and surface ozone also affect BVOC emissions , which adds significant uncertainty 606	0
7.3.5.4 Synthesis The emissions, properties and concentrations of aerosols or aerosol precursors could respond significantly to climate change, but there is little consistency across studies in the magnitude or sign of this response. The lack of consistency arises mostly from our limited understanding of processes governing the source of natural aerosols and the complex interplay of aerosols with the hydrological cycle. The feedback parameter as a result of the future changes in emissions of natural aerosols is mostly bracketed within 0.1 W m-2 C-1 . With respect to anthropogenic aerosols, Liao et al.  showed a significant positive feedback  while Bellouin et al.  simulated a smaller negative feedback of -0.08 to -0.02 W m-2 C-1. Overall we assess that models simulate relatively small feedback parameters  with low confidence, however regional effects on the aerosol may be important.	0
This section assesses our understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions, emphasizing the ways in which anthropogenic aerosol may be affecting the distribution and radiative properties of non- and weakly precipitating clouds. The idea that anthropogenic aerosol is changing cloud properties, thus contributing a substantial forcing to the climate system, has been addressed to varying degrees in all of the previous IPCC assessment reports. Since AR4, research has continued to articulate new pathways through which the aerosol may affect the radiative properties of clouds, as well as the intensity and spatial patterns of precipitation . Progress can be identified on four fronts:  global-scale modelling now represents a greater diversity of aerosol-cloud interactions, and with greater internal consistency;  observational studies continue to document strong local correlations between aerosol and cloud properties or precipitation, but have become more quantitative and are increasingly identifying and addressing the methodological challenges associated with such correlations;  regional-scale modelling is increasingly being used to assess regional influences of aerosol on cloud field properties and precipitation;  fine-scale process models have begun to be used more widely, and among other things have shown how turbulent mixing, cloud and meso-scale circulations may buffer the effects of aerosol perturbations. This section focuses on the microphysics of aerosol-cloud interactions in liquid, mixed-phase and pure ice clouds. Their radiative implications are quantified in Section 7.5. This section also includes a discussion of	0
7.4.1.1 Classification of Hypothesized Aerosol-Cloud Interactions Denman et al.  catalogued several possible pathways via which the aerosol might affect clouds. Given the number of possible aerosol-cloud interactions, and the difficulty of isolating them individually, there is little value in attempting to assess each effect in isolation, especially because modelling studies suggest that the effects may interact and compensate . Instead, all radiative consequences of aerosol- cloud interactions are grouped into an `effective radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions', or ERFaci . ERFaci accounts for aerosol-related microphysical modifications to the cloud albedo , as well as any secondary effects that result from clouds adjusting rapidly to changes in their environment . We do assess the physical underpinnings of the cloud albedo effect, but in contrast to previous assessments, no longer distinguish the resultant forcing. Note that ERFaci includes potential radiative adjustments to the cloud system associated with aerosol-cloud interactions but does not include adjustments originating from aerosol-radiation interactions . Possible contributions to ERFaci from warm  clouds are discussed in Section 7.4.3, separately from those associated with adjustments by cold  clouds . Figure 7.16 shows a schematic of many of the processes to be discussed in Sections 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6.	0
7.4.1.2 Advances and Challenges in Observing Aerosol-Cloud Interactions Since AR4, numerous field studies  and laboratory investigations  of aerosol-cloud interactions have highlighted the numerous ways that the aerosol impacts cloud processes, and how clouds in turn modify the aerosol. The latter occurs along a number of pathways including aqueous chemistry, which adds aerosol mass to droplets ; coalescence scavenging, whereby drop collision-coalescence diminishes the droplet  number concentration  and changes the mixing state of the aerosol; new particle formation in the vicinity of clouds ; and aerosol removal by precipitation . Satellite-based remote sensing continues to be the primary source of global data for aerosol-cloud interactions but concerns persist regarding how measurement artefacts affect retrievals of both aerosol  and cloud properties  in broken cloud fields. Two key issues are that measurements classified as `cloud-free' may not be, and that aerosol measured in the vicinity of clouds is significantly different than it would be were the cloud field, and its proximate cause , not present . The latter results from humidification effects on aerosol optical properties , contamination by undetectable cloud fragments  and the remote effects of radiation scattered by cloud edges on aerosol retrieval .	0
50 - 100 km Figure 7.16 | Schematic depicting the myriad aerosol-cloud-precipitation related processes occurring within a typical GCM grid box. The schematic conveys the importance of considering aerosol-cloud-precipitation processes as part of an interactive system encompassing a large range of spatiotemporal scales. Cloud types include low-level stratocumulus and cumulus where research focuses on aerosol activation, mixing between cloudy and environmental air, droplet coalescence and scavenging which results in cloud processing of aerosol particles, and new particle production near clouds; cirrus clouds where a key issue is ice nucleation through homogeneous and heterogeneous freezing; and deep convective clouds where some of the key questions relate to aerosol influences on liquid, ice, and liquid-ice pathways for precipitation formation, cold pool formation and scavenging. These processes influence the shortwave and longwave cloud radiative effect and hence climate. Primary processes that affect aerosol-cloud interactions are labelled in blue while secondary processes that result from and influence aerosol-cloud interactions are in grey.	0
While most passive satellite retrievals are unable to distinguish aerosol layers above or below clouds from those intermingling with the cloud field, active space-based remote sensing  has begun to address this problem . Spectral polarization and multi-angular measurements can discriminate between cloud droplets and aerosol particles and thus improve estimates of aerosol loading and absorption . Use of active remote sensing, both from monitoring ground stations  and satellites , as well as aerosol proxies not influenced by cloud contamination of retrievals  have emerged as a particular effective way of identifying whether aerosol and cloud perturbations are intermingled. Because the aerosol is a strong function of air-mass history and origin, and is strongly influenced by cloud and precipitation processes , and both are affected by meteorology , correlations between the aerosol and cloud, or precipitation, should not be taken as generally indicating a cloud response to the aerosol . Furthermore, attempts to control for other important factors  are limited by a lack of understanding of large-scale cloud controlling factors in the first place . These problems are increasingly being considered in observationally based inferences of aerosol effects on clouds and precipitation, but ascribing changes in cloud properties to changes in the aerosol remains a fundamental challenge.	0
Fine-scale LES and CRM models  have greatly advanced as a tool for testing the physical mechanisms proposed to govern aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions . Their main limitation is that they are idealized, for example, they do not resolve synoptic scale circulations or allow for representation of orography. A general finding from explicit numerical simulations of warm  clouds is that various aerosol impact mechanisms tend to be mediated  by interactions across scales not included in the idealized albedo and lifetime effects . Specific examples involve the interplay between the drop-size distribution and mixing processes that determine cloud macrostructure , or the dependence of precipitation development in stratiform clouds on details of the vertical structure of the cloud . Thus warm clouds may typically 608	0
be less sensitive to aerosol perturbations in nature than in large-scale models, which do not represent all of these compensating processes. Hints of similar behaviour in mixed-phase  stratus are beginning to be documented  but process-level understanding and representation in models are less advanced. Regional models include realism in the form of non-idealized meteorology, synoptic scale forcing, variability in land surface, and diurnal/ monthly cycles , however, at the expense of resolving finescale cloud processes. Regional models have brought to light the possibility of aerosol spatial inhomogeneity causing changes in circulation patterns via numerous mechanisms including changes in the radiative properties of cloud anvils , changes in the spatial distribution of precipitation  or gradients in heating rates associated with aerosol-radiation interactions . GCMs, our primary tool for quantifying global mean forcings, now represent an increasing number of hypothesized aerosol-cloud interactions, but at poor resolution. GCMs are being more closely scrutinized through comparisons to observations and to other models . Historically, aerosol-cloud interactions in GCMs have been based on simple constructs . There has been significant progress on parameterizing aerosol activation  and ice nucleation ; however, these still depend heavily on unresolved quantities such as updraught velocity. Similarly, parameterizations of aerosol influences on cloud usually do not account for known non-monotonic responses of cloud amount and properties to aerosols . Global models are now beginning to represent aerosol effects in convective, ice and mixed-phase clouds . Nevertheless, for both liquid-only and mixed-phase clouds, these parameterizations are severely limited by the need to parameterize cloud-scale motions over a huge range of spatio-temporal scales . Although advances have been considerable, the challenges remain daunting. The response of cloud systems to aerosol is nuanced  and the representation of both clouds and aerosol-cloud interactions in large-scale models remains primitive . Thus it is not surprising that large-scale models exhibit a range of manifestations of aerosol-cloud interactions, which limits quantitative inference . This highlights the need to incorporate into GCMs the lessons learned from cloud-scale models, in a physically-consistent way. New `super-parameterization' and probability distribution function approaches  hold promise, with recent results supporting the notion that aerosol forcing is smaller than simulated by standard climate models .	0
7.4.2.1 The Physical Basis The cloud albedo effect  is the mechanism by which an increase in aerosol number concentration leads to an increase in the albedo of liquid clouds  by increasing the cloud droplet number concentration, decreasing the droplet size, and hence increasing total droplet surface area, with the liquid water content and cloud geometrical thickness hypothetically held fixed. Although only the change in the droplet concentration is considered in the original concept of the cloud albedo effect, a change in the shape of the droplet size distribution that is directly induced by the aerosols may also play a role . In the Arctic, anthropogenic aerosol may influence the longwave emissivity of optically thin liquid clouds and generate a positive forcing at the surface , but TOA forcing is thought to be negligible.	0
7.4.2.2 Observational Evidence for Aerosol-Cloud Interactions The physical basis of the albedo effect is fairly well understood, with research since AR4 generally reinforcing earlier work. Detailed in situ aircraft observations show that droplet concentrations observed just above the cloud base generally agree with those predicted based on the aerosol properties and updraught velocity observed below the cloud . Vertical profiles of cloud droplet effective radius also agree with those predicted by models that take into account the effect of entrainment , although uncertainties still remain in estimating the shape of the droplet size distribution , and the degree of entrainment mixing within clouds. At relatively low aerosol loading  there is ample observational evidence for increases in aerosol resulting in an increase in droplet concentration and decrease in droplet size  but uncertainties remain regarding the magnitude of this effect, and its sensitivity to spatial averaging. Based on simple metrics, there is a large range of physically plausible responses, with aircraft measurements  tending to show stronger responses than satellite-derived responses . At high AOD and high aerosol concentration, droplet concentration tends to saturate  and, if the aerosol is absorbing, there may be reductions in droplet concentration and cloudiness . This absorbing effect originates from aerosol-radiation interactions	0
7.4.2.3 Advances in Process Level Understanding At the heart of the albedo effect lie two fundamental issues. The first is aerosol activation and its sensitivity to aerosol and dynamical parameters. The primary controls on droplet concentration are the aerosol number concentration  and cooling rate . Aerosol size distribution can play an important role under high aerosol loadings, whereas aerosol composition tends to be much less important, except perhaps under very polluted conditions and low updraught velocities . This is partially because aging tends to make particles more hygroscopic regardless of their initial composition, but also because more hygroscopic particles lead to faster water vapour uptake, which then lowers supersaturation, limiting the initial increase in activation. The second issue is that the amount of energy reflected by a cloud system is a strong function of the amount of condensate. Simple arguments show that in a relative sense the amount of reflected energy is approximately two-and-a-half times more sensitive to changes in the liquid water path than to changes in droplet concentration . Because both of these parameters experience similar ranges of relative variability, the magnitude of aerosol-cloud related forcing rests mostly on dynamical factors such as turbulent strength and entrainment that control cloud condensate, and a few key aerosol parameters such as aerosol number concentration and size distribution, and to a much lesser extent, composition.	0
7.4.3.1 The Physical Basis for Adjustments in Liquid Clouds The adjustments giving rise to ERFaci are multi-faceted and are associated with both albedo and so-called `lifetime' effects . However, this old nomenclature is misleading because it assumes a relationship between cloud lifetime and cloud amount or water content. Moreover, the effect of the aerosol on cloud amount may have nothing to do with cloud lifetime per se . The traditional view  has been that adjustment effects associated with aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions will add to the initial albedo increase by increasing cloud amount. The chain of reasoning involves three steps: that droplet concentrations depend on the number of available CCN; that precipitation development is regulated by the droplet concentration; and that the development of precipitation reduces cloud amount . Of the three steps, the first has ample support in both observations and theory . More problematic are the last two links in the chain of reasoning. Although increased droplet concentrations inhibit the initial development of precipitation , it is not clear that such an effect is sustained in an evolving cloud field. In the trade-cumulus regime, some modelling 609	0
The development of precipitation in stratocumulus, whether due to aerosol or meteorological influence can, in some instances, change a highly reflective closed-cellular cloud field to a weakly reflective broken open-cellular field . In some cases, compact regions  of open-cellular convection become surrounded by regions of closed-cellular convection. It is, however, noteworthy that observed precipitation rates can be similar in both open and closed-cell environments . The lack of any apparent difference in the large-scale environment of the open cells, versus the surrounding closed cellular convection, suggests the potential for multiple equilibria . Therefore in the stratocumulus regime, the onset of precipitation due to a dearth of aerosol may lead to a chain of events that leads to a large-scale reduction of cloudiness in agreement with Liou and Ou  and Albrecht . The transition may be bidirectional: ship tracks passing through open-cell regions also appear to revert the cloud field to a closed-cell regime inducing a potentially strong ERFaci locally . 7.4.3.2.2	0
The cloud albedo effect is best manifested in so-called ship tracks, which are bright lines of clouds behind ships. Many ship tracks are characterized by an increase in the droplet concentration resulting from the increase in aerosol number concentration and an absence of drizzle size drops, which leads to a decrease in the droplet radius and an increase in the cloud albedo , all else equal. However, liquid water changes are the primary determinant of albedo changes , therefore adjustments are key to understanding radiative response. Coakley and Walsh  showed that cloud water responses can be either positive or negative. This is supported by more recent shiptrack analyses based on new satellite sensors : aerosol intrusions result in weak decreases in liquid water  in overcast clouds, but significant increases in liquid water  and increases in cloud fraction in precipitating, broken stratocumulus clouds. The global ERFaci of visible ship tracks has been estimated from satellite and found to be insignificant at about -0.5 mW m-2 , although this analysis may not have identified all shiptracks. Some observational studies downwind of ship tracks have been unable to distinguish aerosol influences from meteorological influences on cloud microphysical or macrophysical properties , although it is not clear whether their methodology had sufficient sensitivity to detect the aerosol effects. Notwithstanding evidence of shiptracks locally increasing the cloud fraction and albedo of broken cloud scenes quite significantly , their contribution to global ERFaci is thought to be small. These ship track results are consistent with satellite studies of the influence of long-term degassing of low-lying volcanic aerosol on stratocumulus, which point to smaller droplet sizes but ambiguous changes in cloud fraction and cloud water . The lack of clear evidence for a global increase in cloud albedo from shiptracks and volcanic plumes should be borne in mind when considering geoengineering methods that rely on cloud modification . 610	0
Stratocumulus Precipitation from trade cumuli proves difficult to observe, as the clouds are small, and not easily observed by space-based remote sensing techniques . Satellite remote sensing of trade cumuli influenced by aerosol associated with slow volcanic degassing points to smaller droplet size, decreased precipitation efficiency, increased cloud amount and higher cloud tops . Other studies show that in the trade cumulus regime cloud amount tends to increase with precipitation amount: for example, processes that favour precipitation development also favour cloud development ; precipitation-driven colliding outflows tend to regenerate clouds; and trade cumuli that support precipitation reach heights where wind shear increases cloud fraction . While observationally based study of the microphysical aspects of aerosol-cloud interactions has a long history, more recent assessment of the ability of detailed models to reproduce the associated radiative effect in cumulus cloud fields is beginning to provide the important link between aerosol-cloud interactions and total RF .	0
7.4.3.3 Advances in Process Level Understanding Central to ERFaci is the question of how susceptible is precipitation to droplet concentration, and by inference, to the available aerosol. Some studies point to the droplet effective radius as a threshold indicator of the onset of drizzle . Others focus on the sensitivity of the conversion of cloud water to rain water  to droplet concentration, which is usually in the form of  to the power -a. Both approaches indicate that from the microphysical standpoint, an increase in the aerosol suppresses rainfall. Models and theory show a ranging from 1/2  to 2 , while observational studies suggest a = 1 (approximately the inverse of drop concentration;	0
7.4.4 Small-scale studies  and satellite observations  tend to confirm two responses of the cloud liquid water to increasing aerosol. Under clean conditions when clouds are prone to precipitation, an increase in the aerosol tends to increase cloud amount as a result of aerosol suppression of precipitation. Under non-precipitating conditions, clouds tend to thin in response to increasing aerosol through a combination of droplet sedimentation  and evaporation-entrainment adjustments . Treatment of the subtlety of these responses and associated detail in small-scale cloud processes is not currently feasible in GCMs, although probability distribution function approaches are promising . Since AR4, cloud resolving model simulation has begun to stress the importance of scale interactions when addressing aerosol-cloud interactions. Model domains on the order of 100 km allow mesoscale circulations to develop in response to changes in the aerosol. These dynamical responses may have a significant impact on cloud morphology and RF. Examples include the significant changes in cloud albedo associated with transitions between closed and open cellular states discussed above, and the cloud-free, downdraught `shadows' that appear alongside ship tracks . Similar examples of large-scale changes in circulation associated with aerosol and associated influence on precipitation are discussed in Section 7.6.4. These underscore the large gap between our process level understanding of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions and the ability of GCMs to represent them.	0
7.4.3.4 Advances in and Insights Gained from Large-Scale Modelling Studies Regional models are increasingly including representation of aerosol- cloud interactions using sophisticated microphysical models . Some of these regional models are operational weather forecast models that undergo routine evaluation. Yang et al.  show improved simulations of stratocumulus fields when aerosol-cloud interactions are introduced. Regional models are increasingly being used to provide the meteorological context for satellite observations of aerosol-cloud interactions , with some  suggesting that droplet concentration differences are driven primarily by synoptic scale influences rather than aerosol. GCM studies that have explored sensitivity to autoconversion parameterization  show that ERFaci can vary by 1 W m-2	0
7.4.4.1 The Physical Basis for Adjustments in Cold Clouds Mixed-phase clouds, containing both liquid water and ice particles, exist at temperatures between 0C and -38C. At warmer temperatures ice melts rapidly, whereas at colder temperatures liquid water freezes homogeneously. The formation of ice in mixed-phase clouds depends on heterogeneous freezing, initiated by IN , which are typically solid or crystalline aerosol particles. In spite of their very low concentrations , IN have an important influence on mixed-phase clouds. Mineral dust particles have been identified as good IN but far less is known about the IN ability of other aerosol types, and their preferred modes of nucleation. For example, the ice nucleating ability of BC particles remains controversial . Soluble matter can hinder glaciation by depressing the freezing temperature of supercooled drops to the point where homogeneous freezing occurs . Hence anthropogenic perturbations to the aerosol have the potential to affect glaciation, water and ice optical properties, and their radiative effect. Because the equilibrium vapour pressure with respect to ice is lower than that with respect to liquid, the initiation of ice in a supercooled liquid cloud will cause vapour to diffuse rapidly toward ice particles at the expense of the liquid water . This favours the depositional growth of ice crystals, the largest of which may sediment away from the water-saturated region of the atmosphere, influencing the subsequent evolution of the cloud. Hence anthropogenic perturbations to the IN can influence the rate at which ice forms, which in turn may regulate cloud amount , cloud optical properties and humidity near the tropopause. Finally, formation of the ice phase releases latent heat to the environment , and provides alternate, complex pathways for precipitation to develop .	0
7.4.4.3 Observations of Aerosol Effects on Arctic Ice and Mixed-Phase Stratiform Clouds Arctic mixed-phase clouds have received a great deal of attention since AR4, with major field programs conducted in 2004  and 2008 , in addition to long-term monitoring at high northern latitude stations  and analysis of earlier field experiments . Mixed-phase Arctic clouds persist for extended periods of time , in spite of the inherent instability of the ice-water mix . In spite of their low concentrations, IN have an important influence on cloud persistence, with clouds tending to glaciate and disappear rapidly when IN concentrations are relatively high and/or updraught velocities too small to sustain a liquid water layer . The details of the heterogeneous ice-nucleation mechanism remain controversial but there is increasing evidence that ice forms in Arctic stratus via the liquid phase  so that the CCN population also plays an important role . If ice indeed forms via the liquid phase this represents a self-regulating feedback that helps sustain the mixed-phase clouds: as ice forms, liquid water  is depleted, which restricts further ice formation and competition for water vapour via the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process .	0
Gettelman et al., 2010; Salzmann et al., 2010), whereas others attempt to represent the processes explicitly  or ground the development of parameterizations in concepts derived from classical nucleation theory . The details of how these processes are treated have important implications for tropical anvils . Homogeneous ice nucleation in cirrus clouds  depends crucially on the cloud updraught velocity and hence the supersaturation with respect to ice. The onset relative humidities for nucleation have been parameterized using results of parcel model simulations , airborne measurements in cirrus or wave clouds , extensions of classical homogeneous ice nucleation theory  and data from laboratory measurements . There is new evidence that although ice nucleation in cirrus has traditionally been regarded as homogeneous, the preferred freezing pathway may be heterogeneous because it occurs at lower onset relative humidities  than homogeneous nucleation . The onset relative humidities  for heterogeneous nucleation depend on the type and size of the IN . Cloud resolving modeling of deep convective clouds points to the potential for aerosol-related changes in cirrus anvils , but the physical mechanisms involved and their influence on ERFaci are poorly understood, and their global impact is unclear.	0
7.4.4.4 Advances in Process Level Understanding Since AR4, research on ice-microphysical processes has been very active as evidenced by the abovementioned field experiments . The persistence of some mixed-phase stratiform clouds has prompted efforts to explain this phenomenon in a theoretical framework . Predicting cloud persistence may require a high level of understanding of very detailed processes. For example, ice particle growth by vapour diffusion depends strongly on crystal shape , the details of which may have similar relative influence on glaciation times to the representation of ice nucleation mechanism . A recent review  discusses the myriad processes that create a resilient mixed-phase cloud system, invoking the ideas of `buffering' seen in liquid clouds . Importantly, the Wegener- Bergeron-Findeisen process does not necessarily destabilize the cloud system, unless sufficient ice exists . Bistability has also been observed in the mixed-phase Arctic cloud system; the resilient cloud state is sometimes interrupted by a cloud-free state , but there is much uncertainty regarding the meteorological and microphysical conditions determining which of these states is preferred.	0
7.4.4.5 Advances in and Insights Gained from Large-Scale Modelling Studies Since the AR4, mixed-phase and ice clouds have received significant attention, with effort on representation of both heterogeneous  and homogeneous  freezing processes in GCMs . In GCMs the physics of cirrus clouds usually involves only ice-phase microphysical processes and is somewhat simpler than that of mixed-phase clouds. Nevertheless, representation of aerosol-cloud interactions in mixed-phase and ice clouds is considerably less advanced than that involving liquid-only clouds. Our poor understanding of the climatology and lifecycle of aerosol particles that can serve as IN complicates attempts to assess what constitutes an anthropogenic perturbation to the IN population, let alone the effect of such a perturbation. BC can impact background  cirrus by affecting ice nucleation properties but the effect remains uncertain . The numerous GCM studies that have evaluated ERFaci for ice clouds are summarised in Section 7.5.4.	0
of cloud system responses to aerosol perturbations has become more fully appreciated. Recent work at the process scale has identified compensating adjustments that make the system less susceptible to perturbation than might have been expected based on the earlier albedo and lifetime effects. Increases in the aerosol can therefore result in either an increase or a decrease in aerosol-cloud related forcing depending on the particular environmental conditions. Because many current GCMs do not include the possibility of compensating effects that are not mediated by the large-scale state, there are grounds for expecting these models to overestimate the magnitude of ERFaci. Nevertheless it is also possible that poorly understood and unrepresented interactions could cause real ERFaci to differ in either direction from that predicted by current models. Forcing estimates are discussed in Section 7.5.3.	0
Many studies have reported observations that link solar activity to particular aspects of the climate system . Various mechanisms have been proposed that could amplify relatively small variations in total solar irradiance, such as changes in stratospheric and tropospheric circulation induced by changes in the spectral solar irradiance or an effect of the flux of cosmic rays on clouds. We focus in this subsection on the latter hypothesis while Box 10.2 discusses solar influences on the climate system more generally. Solar activity variations influence the strength and three-dimensional structure of the heliosphere. High solar activity increases the deflection of low energy cosmic rays, which reduces the flux of cosmic rays impinging upon the Earth's atmosphere. It has been suggested that the ionization caused by cosmic rays in the troposphere has an impact on aerosols and clouds . This subsection assesses studies that either seek to establish a causal relationship between cosmic rays and aerosols or clouds by examining empirical correlations, or test one of the physical mechanisms that have been put forward to account for such a relationship.	0
7.4.6.1 Observed Correlations Between Cosmic Rays and Properties of Aerosols and Clouds Correlation between the cosmic ray flux and cloud properties has been examined for decadal variations induced by the 11-year solar cycle, shorter variations associated with the quasi-periodic oscillation in solar activity centred on 1.68 years, or sudden and large variations known as Forbush decrease events. It should be noted that long-term variations in cloud properties are difficult to detect  while shortterm variations may be difficult to attribute to a particular cause. Moreover, the cosmic ray flux co-varies with other solar parameters such as solar and UV irradiance. This makes any attribution of cloud changes to the cosmic ray flux problematic . Some studies have shown co-variation between the cosmic ray flux and low-level cloud cover using global satellite data over periods of typically 5 to 10 years . Such correlations have not proved to be robust when extending the time period under consideration , and restricting the analysis to particular cloud types (Kernthaler et al.,	0
1999) or locations . The purported correlations have also been attributed to ENSO variability  and artefacts of the satellite data cannot be ruled out . Statistically significant  correlations between the diffuse fraction of surface solar radiation and the cosmic ray flux have been found at some locations in the UK over the 1951-2000 period . Harrison  also found a unique 1.68-year periodicity in surface radiation for two different UK sites between 1978 and 1990, potentially indicative of a cosmic ray effect of the same periodicity. Svensmark et al.  found large global reductions in the aerosol Angstrom exponent, liquid water path, and cloud cover after large Forbush decreases, but these results were not corroborated by other studies that found no statistically significant links between the cosmic ray flux and clouds at the global scale . Although some studies found statistically significant correlations between the cosmic ray flux and cloudiness at the regional scale , these correlations were generally weak, cloud changes were small, and the results were sensitive to how the Forbush events were selected and composited .	0
7.4.6.2 Physical Mechanisms Linking Cosmic Rays to Cloudiness The most widely studied mechanism proposed to explain the possible influence of the cosmic ray flux on cloudiness is the `ion-aerosol clear air' mechanism, in which atmospheric ions produced by cosmic rays facilitate aerosol nucleation and growth ultimately impacting CCN concentrations and cloud properties . The variability in atmospheric ionization rates due to changes in cosmic ray flux can be considered relatively well quantified , whereas resulting changes in aerosol nucleation rates are very poorly known . Laboratory experiments indicate that ionization induced by cosmic rays enhances nucleation rates under middle and upper tropospheric conditions, but not necessarily so in the continental boundary layer . Field measurements qualitatively support this view but cannot provide any firm conclusion due to the scarcity and other limitations of free-troposphere measurements , and due to difficulties in separating nucleation induced by cosmic rays from other nucleation pathways in the continental boundary layer . Based on surface aerosol measurements at one site, Kulmala et al.  found no connection between the cosmic ray flux and new particle formation or any other aerosol property over a solar cycle , although particles nucleated in the free troposphere are known to contribute to particle number and CCN concentrations in the boundary layer . Our understanding of the `ion-aerosol clear air' mechanism as a whole relies on a few model investigations that simulate changes in cosmic ray flux over a solar cycle  or during strong Forbush decreases . Changes in CCN concentrations due to variations in the cosmic ray flux appear too weak to cause a significant radiative effect because the aerosol system is insensitive to a small change in the nucleation rate in the presence of pre-existing aerosols .	0
A second pathway linking the cosmic ray flux to cloudiness has been proposed through the global electric circuit. A small direct current is able to flow vertically between the ionosphere and the Earth's surface over fair-weather regions because of cosmic-ray-induced atmospheric ionization. Charge can accumulate at the upper and lower cloud boundaries as a result of the effective scavenging of ions by cloud droplets . This creates conductivity gradients at the cloud edges , and may influence droplet-droplet collisions , cloud droplet-particle collisions  and cloud droplet formation processes . These microphysical effects may potentially influence cloud properties both directly and indirectly. Although Harrison and Ambaum  observed a small reduction in downward longwave radiation that they associated with variations in surface current density, supporting observations are extremely limited. Our current understanding of the relationship between cloud properties and the global electric circuit remains very low, and there is no evidence yet that associated cloud processes could be of climatic significance.	0
In this section, aerosol forcing estimates are synthesized and updated from AR4. As depicted in Figure 7.3, RF refers to the radiative forcing due to either aerosol-radiation interactions , formerly known as the direct aerosol forcing, or aerosol-cloud interactions , formerly known as the first indirect aerosol forcing or cloud albedo effect in AR4. ERF refers to the effective radiative forcing and is typically estimated from experiments with fixed SSTs . It includes rapid adjustments, such as changes to the cloud lifetime, cloud altitude, changes in lapse rate due to absorbing aerosols and aerosol microphysical effects on mixed-phase, ice and convective clouds.	0
Chapter 2 of AR4  assessed RFari to be -0.5  0.4 W m-2 and broke this down into components associated with several species. Land albedo changes associated with BC on snow were assessed to be +0.1  0.1 W m-2. The RFaci was assessed to be -0.70 W m-2 with a -1.8 to -0.3 W m-2 uncertainty range. These uncertainty estimates were based on a combination of model results and observations from remote sensing. The semi-direct effect and other aerosol indirect effects were assessed in Chapter 7 of AR4  to contribute additional uncertainty. The combined total aerosol forcing 614	0
was given as two distinct ranges: -2.3 to -0.2 W m-2 from models and a -1.7 to -0.1 W m-2 range from inverse estimates. As discussed in Section 7.4, it is inherently difficult to separate RFaci from subsequent rapid cloud adjustments either in observations or model calculations . For this reason estimates of RFaci are of limited interest and are not assessed in this report. This chapter estimates RFari, ERFari, and ERFari+aci based purely on a priori approaches, and calculates ERFaci as the residual between ERFari+aci and ERFari assuming the two effects are additive. Inverse studies that estimate ERFari+aci from the observed rate of planetary energy uptake and estimates of climate feedbacks and other RFs are discussed in Section 10.8. For consistency with AR4 and Chapter 8 of this Report, all quoted ranges represent a 5 to 95% uncertainty range unless otherwise stated, and we evaluate the forcings between 1750 and approximately 2010. The reference year of 1750 is chosen to represent pre-industrial times, so changes since then broadly represent the anthropogenic effect on climate, although for several aerosol species  this does not quite equate to the anthropogenic effect as emissions started to be influenced by humans before the Industrial Revolution. Many studies estimate aerosol forcings between 1850 and the present day and any conversion to a forcing between 1750 and the present day increases the uncertainty . This section principally discusses global forcing estimates and attributes them to aerosol species. Chapter 8 discusses regional forcings and additionally attributes aerosol forcing to emission sources.	0
7.5.2.1 Radiative Forcing and Effective Radiative Forcing from All Aerosols Observations can give useful constraints to aspects of the global RFari but cannot measure it directly . Remote sensing observations, in situ measurements of fine-mode aerosol properties and a better knowledge of bulk aerosol optical properties make the estimate of total RFari more robust than the RF for individual species . Estimates of RFari are either taken from global aerosol models directly  or based mostly on observations, but using supplemental information from models . A number of studies  have improved aspects of the satellite-based RFari estimate over those quoted in AR4. Of these, only Myhre  make the necessary adjustments to the observations to account for forcing in cloudy regions and pre-industrial concentrations to estimate a RFari of -0.3  0.2 W m-2.	0
For observationally based estimates, a variety of factors are important in constraining the radiative effect of aerosols . Particularly important are the single scattering albedo  and the AOD . Errors in remotely sensed, retrieved AOD can be 0.05 or larger over land . Loeb and Su  found that the total uncertainty in forcing was dominated by the uncertainty in single scattering albedo, using single scattering albedo errors of  0.06 over ocean and  0.03 over land from Dubovik et al. , and assuming errors can be added in quadrature. These retrieval uncertainties could lead to a 0.5 to 1.0 W m-2 uncertainty in RFari . However, model sensitivity studies and reanalyses can provide additional constraints leading to a reduced error estimate. Ma et al.  performed a sensitivity study in one model, finding a best estimate of RFari of -0.41 W m-2 with an asymmetrical uncertainty range of -0.61 to -0.08 W m-2, with BC particle size and mixing state having the largest effect of the parameters investigated. In models, assumptions about surface albedo, background cloud distribution and radiative transfer contribute a relative standard deviation of 39% . Bellouin et al.  quantified uncertainties in RFari using reanalysis data that combined MODIS satellite data over oceans with the global coverage of their model. This approach broke down the uncertainty in aerosol properties into a local and a regional error to find a RFari standard deviation of 0.3 W m-2, not accounting for uncertainty in the pre-industrial reference. When cloudy-sky and pre-industrial corrections were applied an RFari best estimate of -0.4 W m-2 was suggested. The overall forcing uncertainty in RFari consists of the uncertainty in the distribution of aerosol amount, composition and radiative properties , the uncertainty in radiative transfer  and the uncertainty owing to the dependence of the forcing calculation on other uncertain parameters, such as clouds or surface albedos . To derive a best estimate and range for RFari we combine modelling and observationally based studies. The best estimate is taken as -0.35 W m-2. This is the same as the AeroCom II model estimate, and also the average of the Myhre  observationally based estimate  and the Bellouin et al.  reanalysis estimate . Models probably underestimate the positive RFari from BC and the negative forcing from OA aerosol , and currently there is no evidence that one of these opposing biases dominates over the other. The 5 to 95% range of RFari adopted in this assessment employs the Bellouin et al.  uncertainty to account for retrieval error in observational quantities when constrained by global models, giving an uncertainty estimate of 0.49 W m-2. This is at the low end of the uncertainty analysis of Loeb and Su . However, our uncertainty	0
is partly based on models, and to account for this aspect, it is combined in quadrature with a 0.1 W m-2 uncertainty from non-aerosol related parameters following Stier et al. . This gives an assessed RFari of -0.35  0.5 W m-2. This is a larger range than that exhibited by the AeroCom II models. It is also a smaller magnitude but slightly larger range than in AR4, with a more positive upper bound. This more positive upper bound can be justified by the sensitivity to BC aerosol . Despite the larger range, there is increased confidence in this assessment due to dedicated modelling sensitivity studies, more robust observationally based estimates and their better agreement with models. ERFari adds the radiative effects from rapid adjustments onto RFari. Studies have evaluated the rapid adjustments separately as a semi-direct effect  and/or the ERFari has been directly evaluated. Rapid adjustments are caused principally by cloud changes. There is high confidence that the local heating caused by absorbing aerosols can alter clouds. However, there is low confidence in determining the sign and magnitude of the rapid adjustments at the global scale as current models differ in their responses and are known to inadequately represent some of the important relevant cloud processes . Existing estimates of ERFari nevertheless rely on such global models. Five GCMs were analysed for RFari and ERFari in Lohmann et al. . Their rapid adjustments ranged from -0.3 to +0.1 W m-2. In a further study, Takemura and Uchida  found a rapid adjustment of +0.06 W m-2. The sensitivity analysis of Ghan et al.  found a -0.1 to +0.1 W m-2 range over model variants, where an improved aging of the mixing state led to small negative rapid adjustment of around -0.1 W m-2. Bond et al.  assessed scaled RF and efficacy estimates from seven earlier studies focusing on 2	0

BC and found a range of rapid adjustments between -0.2 and -0.01 W m-2. There is a potential additional rapid adjustment term from the effect of cloud drop inclusions . Based on Ghan et al.  and Jacobson , Bond et al.  estimate an additional ERFari term of +0.2 W m-2, with an uncertainty range of -0.1 to +0.9 W m-2; however there is very low confidence in the sign or magnitude of this effect and we do not include it in our assessment. Overall a best estimate for the rapid adjustment is taken to be -0.1 W m-2, with a 5 to 95% uncertainty range of -0.3 to +0.1 W m-2. The best estimate is based on Ghan et al.  and the range on Lohmann et al. . The uncertainties are added in quadrature to the estimate of RFari and rounded to give an overall assessment for ERFari of -0.45  0.5 W m-2.	0
7.5.2.2 Radiative Forcing by Species AeroCom II studies have calculated aerosol distributions using 1850 and 2000 simulations with the same meteorology to isolate RFari for individual aerosol types . Many of these models account for internal mixing, so that partitioning RFari by species is not straightforward, and different modelling groups adopt different techniques . Note also that due to internal mixing of aerosol types the total RFari is not necessarily the sum of the RFari from different types . Unless otherwise noted in the text below, the best estimate and 5 to 95% ranges for individual types quoted in Figure 7.18 are solely based on the AeroCom II range  and the estimates have been scaled by emissions to derive 1750-2010 RFari values. Note that although global numbers are presented here, these RF estimates all exhibit large regional variations, and individual aerosol species can contribute significantly to regional climate change despite rather small RF estimates . For sulphate, AeroCom II models give a RF median and 5 to 95% uncertainty range of -0.31  W m-2 for the 1850-2000 period, and -0.34  W m-2 for the 1750-2010 period. This estimate and uncertainty range are consistent with the AR4 estimate of -0.4  0.2 W m-2, which is retained as the best estimate for AR5.	0
RF from BC is evaluated in different ways in the literature. The BC RF in this report is from fossil fuel and biofuel sources, while open burning sources are attributed separately to the biomass-burning aerosol, which also includes other organic species . BC can also affect clouds and surface albedo . Here we only isolate the fossil fuel and biofuel RFari attributable to BC over 1750-2010. Two comprehensive studies have quantified the BC RFari and derive different central estimates and uncertainty ranges. Myhre et al.  quantify RF over 1850-2000 in the AeroCom II generation of models and scale these up using emissions to derive an RF estimate over 1750-2010 of +0.23  W m-2 for fossil fuel and biofuel emissions. Bond et al.  employ an observationally weighted scaling of an earlier generation of AeroCom models, regionally scaling BC absorption to match absorption AOD as retrieved at available AERONET sites. They derive a RF of +0.51  W m-2 for fossil fuel and biofuel sources. There are known biases in BC RF estimates from aerosol models. BC concentrations are underestimated near source regions, especially in Asia, but overesti616	0
mated in remote regions and at altitude . Models also probably underestimate the mass absorption cross-section probably because enhanced absorption due to internal mixing is insufficiently accounted for . Together these biases are expected to cause the modelled BC RF to be underestimated. The Bond et al. estimate accounted for these biases by scaling model results. However, there are a number of methodological difficulties associated with the absorption AOD retrieval from sunphotometer retrievals , the attribution of absorption AOD to BC, and the distribution and representativeness of AERONET stations for constraining global and relatively coarse-resolution models. Absorption by OA , which may amount to 20% of fine-mode aerosol absorption , is included into the BC RF estimate in Bond et al. but is now treated separately in most AeroCom II models, some of which have a global absorption AOD close to the Bond et al. estimate. We use our expert judgement here to adopt a BC RF estimate that is halfway between the two estimates and has a wider uncertainty range from combining distributions. This gives a BC RF estimate from fossil fuel and biofuel of +0.4  W m-2. The AeroCom II estimate of the SOA RFari is -0.03  W m-2 and the primary OA from fossil fuel and biofuel estimate is -0.05  W m-2. An intercomparison of current chemistry-climate models found two models outside of this range for SOA RFari, with one model exhibiting a significant positive forcing from land use and cover changes influencing biogenic emissions . We therefore adjust the upper end of the range to account for this, giving an SOA RFari estimate of -0.03  W m-2. Our assessment also scales the AeroComII estimate of the primary OA from fossil fuel and biofuel by 1.74 to -0.09  W m-2 to allow for the underestimate of emissions identified in Bond et al. . For OA from natural burning, and for SOA, the natural radiative effects can be an order of magnitude larger than the RF  and they could thus contribute to climate feedback . The RFari from biomass burning includes both BC and OA species that contribute RFari of opposite sign, giving a net RFari close to zero . The AeroCom II models give a 1750- 2010 RFari of 0.00  W m-2, and an estimate of +0.0  W m-2 is adopted in this assessment, doubling the model uncertainty range to account for a probable underestimate of their emissions . Combining information in Samset et al.  and Myhre et al.  would give a BC RFari contribution from biomass burning of slightly less than +0.1 W m-2 over 1850-2000 from the models. However, this ignores a significant contribution expected before 1850 and the probable underestimate in emissions. Our assessment therefore solely relies on Bond et al. , giving an estimate of +0.2  W m-2 for the 1750-2010 BC contribution to the biomass burning RFari. This is a 50% larger forcing than the earlier generation of AeroCom models found . Note that we also expect an OA RFari of the same magnitude with opposite sign. The AeroCom II RF estimate for nitrate aerosol gives an RFari of -0.11  W m-2, but comprises a relatively large 1850 to 1750 correction term. In these models ammonium aerosol is included within the sulphate and nitrate estimates. An intercomparison of current	0
chemistry-climate models found an RF range of -0.41 to -0.03 W m-2 over 1850-2000. Some of the models with strong RF did not exhibit obvious biases, whereas others did . These sets of estimates are in good agreement with earlier estimates . Our assessment of the RFari from nitrate aerosol is -0.11  W m-2. This is based on AeroCom II with an increased lower bound. Anthropogenic sources of mineral aerosols can result from changes in land use and water use or climate change. Estimates of the RF from anthropogenic mineral aerosols are highly uncertain, because natural and anthropogenic sources of mineral aerosols are often located close to each other . Using a compilation of observations of dust records over the 20th century with model simulations, Mahowald et al.  deduced a 1750-2000 change in mineral aerosol RFari including both natural and anthropogenic changes of -0.14  0.11 W m-2. This is consistent within the AR4 estimate of -0.1  0.2 W m-2  which is retained here. Note that part of the dust RF could be due to feedback processes . Overall the species breakdown of RFari is less certain than the total RFari. Fossil fuel and biofuel emissions contribute to RFari via sulphate aerosol -0.4  W m-2; black carbon aerosol +0.4  W m-2; and primary and secondary organic aerosol -0.12  W m-2 . Additional RFari contributions are via biomass burning emissions, where black carbon and organic aerosol changes offset each other to give an estimate of +0.0  W m-2; nitrate aerosol -0.11  W m-2; and a contribution from mineral dust of -0.1  W m-2 that may not be entirely anthropogenic in origin.

7.5.2.3 Absorbing Aerosol on Snow and Sea Ice Forster et al.  estimated the RF for surface albedo changes from BC deposited on snow to be +0.10  0.10 W m-2, with a low level of understanding, based largely on studies from Hansen and Nazarenko  and Jacobson . Since AR4, observations of BC in snow have been conducted using several different measurement techniques , providing data with which to constrain models. Laboratory measurements have confirmed the albedo reduction due to BC in snow . The albedo effects of non-BC constituents have also been investigated but not rigorously quantified. Remote sensing can inform on snow impurity content in some highly polluted regions. However, it cannot be used to infer global anthropogenic RF because of numerous detection challenges . Global modelling studies since AR4 have quantified present-day radiative effects from BC on snow of +0.01 to +0.08 W m-2 . These studies apply different BC emission inventories and atmospheric aerosol representations, include forcing from different combinations of terrestrial snow, sea ice, and snow on sea ice, and some include different rapid adjustment effects such as snow grain size evolution and melt-induced accumulation of impurities at the snow surface, observed on Tibetan glaciers  and in Arctic snow . The forcing operates mostly on terrestrial snow and is largest during March to May, when boreal snow and ice are exposed to strong insolation . All climate modelling studies find that the Arctic warms in response to snow and sea ice forcing. In addition, estimates of the change in global mean surface temperature per unit forcing are 1.7 to 4.5 times greater for snow and sea ice forcing than for CO2 forcing . The Koch et al.  estimate is not included in this range owing to the lack of a clear signal in their study. The greater response of global mean temperature occurs primarily because all of the forcing energy is deposited directly into the cryosphere, whose evolution drives a positive albedo feedback on climate. Key sources of forcing uncertainty include BC concentrations in snow and ice, BC mixing state and optical properties, snow and ice coverage and patchiness, co-presence of other light-absorbing particles in the snow pack, snow effective grain size and its influence on albedo perturbation, the masking of snow surfaces by clouds and vegetation and the accumulation of BC at the top of snowpack caused by melting and sublimation. Bond et al.  derive a 1750-2010 snow and sea ice RF estimate of +0.046  W m-2 for BC by  considering forcing ranges from all relevant global studies,  accounting for biases caused by  modelled Arctic BC-in-snow concentrations using measurements from Doherty et al. , and  excluding mineral dust, which reduces BC forcing by approximately 20%,  combining in quadrature individual uncertainty terms from Flanner et al.  617	0
In addition to ERFari, there are changes due to aerosol-cloud interactions . Because of nonlinearities in forcings and rapid adjustments, the total effective forcing ERFari+aci does not necessarily equal the sum of the ERFari and ERFaci calculated separately. Moreover a strict separation is often difficult in either state of the art models or observations. Therefore we first assess ERFari+aci and postpone our assessment of ERFaci to Section 7.5.4. For similar reasons, we focus primarily on ERF rather than RF. ERFari+aci is defined as the change in the net radiation at the TOA from pre-industrial to present day. Climate model estimates of ERFari+aci in the literature differ for a number of reasons.  The reference years for pre-industrial and present-day conditions vary between estimates. Studies can use 1750, 1850, or 1890 for pre-industrial; early estimates of ERFari+aci used present-day emissions for 1985, whereas most newer estimates use emissions for the year 2000.  The processes they include also differ: aerosol-cloud interactions in large-scale liquid stratiform clouds are typically included, but studies can also include aerosol-cloud interactions for mixed-phase, convective clouds and/or cirrus clouds.  The way in which ERFari+aci is calculated can also differ between models, with some earlier studies only reporting the change in shortwave radiation. Changes in longwave radiation arise from rapid adjustments, or from aerosol-cloud interactions involving mixed-phase or ice clouds , and tend to partially offset changes in shortwave radiation. In the estimates discussed below and those shown in Figure 7.19, we refer to estimates of the change in net  TOA radiation whenever possible, but report changes in shortwave radiation when changes in net radiation are not available. While this mostly affects earlier studies, the subset of models that we concentrate on all include both shortwave and longwave radiative effects. However, for the sake of comparison, the satellite studies must be adjusted to account for missing longwave contributions as explained below.	0
Early GCM estimates of ERFari+aci only included aerosol-cloud interactions in liquid phase stratiform clouds; some of these were already considered in AR4. Grouping these early estimates with similar  estimates from publications since the AR4 yields a median value of ERFari+aci of -1.5 W m-2 with a 5 to 95% range between -2.4 and -0.6 W m-2 . In those studies that attempt a more complete representation of aerosol-cloud interactions, by including aerosol-cloud interactions in mixed-phase and/or convective cloud, the magnitude of the ERF tends to be somewhat smaller . The physical explanation for the mixed-phase reduction in the 618	0
magnitude of the ERF is that some aerosols also act as IN causing supercooled clouds to glaciate and precipitate more readily. This reduction in cloud cover leads to less reflected shortwave radiation and a less negative ERFari+aci. This effect can however be offset if the IN become coated with soluble material, making them less effective at nucleating ice, leading to less efficient precipitation production and more reflected shortwave radiation . Models that have begun to incorporate aerosol-cloud interactions in convective clouds also have a tendency to reduce the magnitude of the ERF, but this effect is less systematic  and reasons for differences among the models in this category are less well understood. For our expert judgment of ERFari+aci a subset of GCM studies, which strived for a more complete and consistent treatment of aerosol-cloud interactions  was identified and scrutinized. The ERFari+aci derived from these models is somewhat less negative than in the full suite of models, and ranges from -1.68 and -0.81 W m-2 with a median value of -1.38 W m-2. Because in some cases a number of studies have been performed with the same GCM, in what might be described as an evolving effort, our assessment is further restricted to the best  estimate by each modelling group . This ensures that no single GCM is given a disproportionate weight. Further, we consider only simulations not constrained by the historical temperature rise, motivated by the desire to emphasize a process-based estimate. Although it may be argued that greater uncertainty is introduced by giving special weight to models that only incorporate more comprehensive treatments of aerosol-cloud interactions, and for processes that  are on the frontier of understanding, it should be remembered that aerosol-cloud interactions for liquid-phase clouds remain very uncertain. Although the understanding and treatment of aerosol-cloud interactions in convective or mixedphase clouds are also very uncertain, as discussed in Section 7.4.4, we exercise our best judgment of their influence. A less negative ERFari+aci  is found in studies that use variability in the present day satellite record to infer aerosol-cloud interactions, or that constrain GCM parameterizations to optimize agreement with satellite observations. Because some groups have published multiple estimates as better information became available, only their latest study was incorporated into this assessment. Moreover, if a study did not report ERFari+aci but only evaluated changes in ERFaci, their individual estimate was combined with the average ERFari of -0.45 W m-2 from Section 7.5.2. Likewise, those  studies that only accounted for changes in shortwave radiation when computing ERFaci were corrected by adding a constant factor of +0.2 W m-2, taken from the lower range of the modeled longwave effects which varied from +0.2 to +0.6 W m-2 in the assessed models. These procedures result in the final estimates of ERFari+aci shown as black symbols in Figure 7.19 and in Table 7.4. This resulted in a median ERFari+aci of -0.85 W m-2 for satellite-based ERFari+aci estimates. Results of pure satellite-based studies are sensitive to the spatial scale of measurements , as well as to how pre-industrial conditions and variations between preindustrial and present-day conditions are inferred from the observed	0

In large-scale models for which cloud-scale circulations are not explicitly represented, it is difficult to capture all relevant cloud controlling processes . Because the response of clouds to aerosol perturbations depends critically on the interplay of poorly understood physical processes, global model-based estimates of aerosol-cloud interactions remain uncertain . Moreover, the connection between the aerosol amount and cloud properties is too direct in the large-scale modelling studies . Because of this, GCMs tend to overestimate the magnitude of the aerosol effect on cloud properties . This view has some support from studies that begin to incorporate some cloud, or cloud-system scale responses to aerosol- cloud interactions. For instance, in an attempt to circumvent some of difficulties of parameterizing clouds, some groups  have begun developing modelling frameworks that can explicitly represent cloud-scale circulations, and hence the spatio-temporal covariances of cloud-controlling processes. Another group  has used the same cloud-resolving model in a radiative convective equilibrium approach, and compared the relative contribution of aerosol-cloud interactions to warming from the doubling of atmospheric CO2. In both studies a smaller  ERFari+aci than for the average GCM was found. Furthermore, the study best resolving the cloud-scale circulations  found little change in cloud amount in response to 620	0
variability in present-day aerosol and cloud properties . In addition, all  estimates of ERFari+aci are very sensitive to the assumed pre-industrial or natural cloud droplet concentration . The large spatial scales of satellite measurements relative to in situ measurements generally suggest smaller responses in cloud droplet number increases for a given aerosol increase . Satellite studies, however, show a strong effect of aerosol on cloud amount, which could be a methodological artefact as GCMs associate clouds with humidity and aerosol swelling . There are thus possible biases in both directions, so the sign and magnitude of any net bias is not clear.	0
changes in aerosol, consistent with other fine-scale modelling studies discussed in Section 7.4. Based on the above considerations, we assess ERFari+aci using expert judgement to be -0.9 W m-2 with a 5 to 95% uncertainty range of -1.9 to -0.1 W m-2 , and a likely range of -1.5 to -0.4 W m-2. These ranges account for the GCM results by allowing for an ERFari+aci somewhat stronger than what is estimated by the satellite studies with a longer tail in the direction of stronger effects, but  give less weight to the early GCM estimates shown in Figure 7.19. The ERFari+aci can be much larger regionally but the global value is consistent with several new lines of evidence suggesting less negative estimates of aerosol-cloud interactions than the corresponding estimate in Chapter 7 of AR4 of -1.2 W m-2. The AR4 estimate was based mainly on GCM studies that did not take secondary processes  into account, did not benefit as much from the use of the recent satellite record, and did not account for the effect of rapid adjustments on the longwave radiative budget. This uncertainty range is slightly smaller than the -2.3 to -0.2 W m-2 in AR4, with a less negative upper bound due to the reasons outlined above. The best estimate of ERFari+aci is not only consistent with the studies allowing cloud-scale responses  but also is in line with the average ERFari+aci from the CMIP5/ ACCMIP models , which as a whole reproduce the observed warming of the 20th century . Studies that infer ERFari+aci from the historical temperature rise are discussed in Section 10.8.	0
c onstruct. However, processes in GCMs that tend to affect RFaci such as changes to the droplet size distribution breadth  will also affect ERFaci. Early studies evaluated just the change in shortwave radiation or cloud radiative effect for ERFaci, but lately the emphasis has changed to report changes in net TOA radiation for ERFaci. As discussed in Section 7.5.3, evaluating ERFaci from changes in net TOA radiation is the only correct method, and therefore this is used whenever possible also in this section. However some earlier estimates of ERFaci only reported changes in cloud radiative effect, which we show in Figure 7.19 as the last resort. However, estimates of changes in cloud radiative effect can differ quite substantially from those in net radiation if rapid adjustments to aerosol-cloud interactions induce changes in clear-sky radiation. Cloud amount and lifetime effects manifest themselves in GCMs via their representation of autoconversion of cloud droplets to rain, a process that is inversely dependent on droplet concentration. Thus, ERFaci and ERFari+aci have been found to be very sensitive to the autoconversion parameterization . GCMs probably underestimate the extent to which precipitation is formed via raindrop accretion of cloud droplets , a process that is insensitive to aerosol and droplet concentration. Indeed, models that remedy this imbalance in precipitation formation between autoconversion and accretion  exhibit weaker ERFaci in agreement with small-scale studies that typically do not show a systematic increase in cloud lifetime because of entrainment and because smaller droplets also evaporate more readily . Bottom-up estimates of ERFaci are shown in Figure 7.19. Their median estimate of -1.4 W m-2 is more negative than our expert judgement of ERFari+aci because of the limitations of these studies discussed above.	0
There is conflicting evidence for the importance of ERFaci associated with cirrus, ranging from a statistically significant impact on cirrus coverage  to a very small effect . Penner et al.  obtained a rather large negative RFaci of anthropogenic ice-forming aerosol on upper tropospheric clouds of -0.67 to -0.53 W m-2; however, they ignored potential compensating effects on lower lying clouds. A new study based on two GCMs and different ways to deduce ERFaci on cirrus clouds estimates ERFaci to be +0.27  0.1 W m-2 , thus rendering aerosol effects on cirrus clouds smaller than previously estimated and of opposite sign. One reason for having switched to providing an expert judgment estimate of ERFari+aci rather than of ERFaci is that the individual contributions are very difficult to disentangle. The individual components can be isolated only if linearity of ERFari and ERFaci is assumed but there is no a priori reason why the ERFs should be additive because by definition they occur in a system that is constantly readjusting to multiple nonlinear forcings. Nevertheless assuming additivity, ERFaci could be obtained as the difference between ERFari+aci and ERFari. This yields an ERFaci estimate of -0.45 W m-2, that is, much smaller than the median ERFaci value of -1.4 W m-2 . This discrepancy arises because the GCM estimates of ERFaci do not consider secondary processes and because these studies are not necessarily conducted with the same GCMs that estimate ERFari+aci. This difference could also be a measure of the non-linearity of the ERFs. A 90% uncertainty range of -1.2 to 0 W m-2 is adopted for ERFaci, which accounts for the error covariance between ERFari and ERFaci and the larger uncertainty on the lower bound. In summary, there is much less confidence associated with the estimate of ERFaci than with the estimate of ERFari+aci.	0
FAQ 7.2 | How Do Aerosols Affect Climate and Climate Change? Atmospheric aerosols are composed of small liquid or solid particles suspended in the atmosphere, other than larger cloud and precipitation particles. They come from natural and anthropogenic sources, and can affect the climate in multiple and complex ways through their interactions with radiation and clouds. Overall, models and observations indicate that anthropogenic aerosols have exerted a cooling influence on the Earth since pre-industrial times, which has masked some of the global mean warming from greenhouse gases that would have occurred in their absence. The projected decrease in emissions of anthropogenic aerosols in the future, in response to air quality policies, would eventually unmask this warming. Atmospheric aerosols have a typical lifetime of one day to two weeks in the troposphere, and about one year in the stratosphere. They vary greatly in size, chemical composition and shape. Some aerosols, such as dust and sea spray, are mostly or entirely of natural origin, while other aerosols, such as sulphates and smoke, come from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Aerosols affect climate in many ways. First, they scatter and absorb sunlight, which modifies the Earth's radiative balance . Aerosol scattering generally makes the planet more reflective, and tends to cool the climate, while aerosol absorption has the opposite effect, and tends to warm the climate system. The balance between cooling and warming depends on aerosol properties and environmental conditions. Many observational studies have quantified local radiative effects from anthropogenic and natural aerosols, but determining their 	0
global impact requires satellite data and models. One of the remaining uncertainties comes from black carbon, an absorbing aerosol that not only is more difficult to measure than scattering aerosols, but also induces a complicated cloud response. Most studies agree, however, that the overall radiative effect from anthropogenic aerosols is to cool the planet. Aerosols also serve as condensation and ice nucleation sites, on which cloud droplets and ice particles can form . When influenced by more aerosol particles, clouds of liquid water droplets tend to have more, but smaller droplets, which causes these clouds to reflect more solar radiation. There are however many other pathways for aerosol-cloud interactions, particularly in ice--or mixed liquid and ice--clouds, where phase changes between liquid and ice water are sensitive to aerosol concentrations and properties. The initial view that an increase in aerosol concentration will also increase the amount of low clouds has been challenged because a number of counteracting processes come into play. Quantifying the overall impact of aerosols on cloud amounts and properties is understandably difficult. Available studies, based on climate models and satellite observations, generally indicate that the net effect of anthropogenic aerosols on clouds is to cool the climate system. Because aerosols are distributed unevenly in the atmosphere, they can heat and cool the climate system in patterns that can drive changes in the weather. These effects are complex, and hard to simulate with current models, but several studies suggest significant effects on precipitation in certain regions.	0

Panels  and  represent a clean and a polluted low-level cloud, aerosols--and their climate effects--have varied respectively. over time, in rough concert with anthropogenic emissions of aerosols and their precursors in the gas phase such as sulphur dioxide  and some volatile organic compounds. Because anthropogenic aerosol emissions have increased substantially over the industrial period, this has counteracted some of the warming that would otherwise have occurred from increased concentrations of well mixed greenhouse gases. Aerosols from large volcanic eruptions that enter the stratosphere, such as those of El Chichon and Pinatubo, have also caused cooling periods that typically last a year or two.	0
In this section we outline some of the main processes thought to control the climatological distribution of precipitation and precipitation extremes. Emphasis is placed on large-scale constraints that relate to processes, such as changes in the water vapour mixing ratio that accompany warming, or changes in atmospheric heating rates that accompany changing GHG and aerosol concentrations, which are discussed earlier in this chapter. The fidelity with which large-scale models represent different aspects of precipitation, ranging from the diurnal cycle to extremes, is discussed in Section 9.4.1. Building on, and adding to, concepts developed here, Section 11.3.2 presents near term projections of changes in regional precipitation features. Projections of changes on longer time scales, again with more emphasis on regionally specific features and the coupling to the land surface, are presented in Section 12.4.5. The effect of processes discussed in this section on specific precipitation systems, such as the monsoon, the intertropical convergence zones, or tropical cyclones are presented in Chapter 14. Precipitation is sustained by the availability of moisture and energy. In a globally averaged sense the oceans provide an unlimited supply of moisture, so that precipitation formation is energetically limited . Locally precipitation can be greatly modified by limitations in the availability of moisture  and the effect of circulation systems, although these too are subject to local energetic constraints . There are many ways to satisfy these constraints, and climate models still exhibit substantial biases in their representation of the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation . Nonetheless, through careful analysis, it is possible to identify robust features in the simulated response of precipitation to changes in precipitation drivers. In almost every case these can be related to well understood processes, as described below.	0
The atmospheric water vapour mixing ratio is expected to increase with temperature roughly following the saturation value . Increases in global mean precipitation are, however, constrained by changes in the net radiative cooling rate of the troposphere. GCMs, whose detailed treatment of radiative transfer provides a basis for calculating these energetic limitations, suggest that for the CO2 forcing, globally-averaged precipitation increases with global mean surface temperature at about 1 to 3% C-1 . Precipitation changes evince considerable regional variability about the globally averaged value; generally speaking precipitation is expected to increase in the wettest latitudes, whereas dry latitudes may even see a precipitation decrease . On smaller scales, or near precipitation margins, the response is less clear due to model-specific, and less well understood, regional circulation shifts , but there 624	0
is some evidence that the sub-tropical dry zones are expanding , both as a result of the tropical convergence zones narrowing , and the storm tracks moving poleward  and strengthening . The `wet-get-wetter' and `dry-get-drier' response that is evident at large scales over oceans can be understood as a simple consequence of a change in the water vapour content carried by circulations, which otherwise are little changed . Wet regions are wet because they import moisture from dry regions, increasingly so with warmer temperatures. These ideas have withstood additional analysis and scrutiny since AR4 , are evident in 20th century precipitation trends  and are assessed on different time scales in Chapters 11 and 12. Because the wet-get-wetter argument implies that precipitation changes associated with warming correlate with the present-day pattern of precipitation, biases in the simulation of present-day precipitation will lead to biases in the projections of future precipitation change . The wet-get-wetter and dry-get-drier response pattern is mitigated, particularly in the dry regions, by the anticipated slowdown of the atmospheric circulation , as well as by gains from local surface evaporation. The slowdown within the descent regions can be partly understood as a consequence of the change in the dry static stability of the atmosphere with warming. And although this line of argument is most effective for explaining changes over the ocean , it can also be used to understand the GCM land responses to some extent . The non-uniform nature of surface warming induces regional circulation shifts that affect precipitation trends. In the tropics SSTs warm more where winds are weak and thus are less effective in damping surface temperature anomalies, and precipitation systematically shifts to regions that warm more . The greater warming over land, and its regional variations, also affect the regional distributions of precipitation . However, low understanding of soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks complicates interpretations of local responses to warming over land , so that the effect of warming on precipitation at the scale of individual catchments is not well understood. Some broad-scale responses, particularly over the ocean, are more robust and relatively well understood.	0
In the absence of a compensating temperature change, an increase in well-mixed GHG concentrations tends to reduce the net radiative cooling of the troposphere. This reduces the rainfall rate and the strength of the overturning circulation , such that the increase in global mean precipitation would be 1.5 to 3.5% C-1 due to temperature alone but is reduced by about 0.5% C-1 due to the effect of CO2 . The dynamic effects are similar to those that result from the effect of atmospheric warming on the lapse rate, which also reduces the strength of the atmospheric	0
overturning circulation , and are robustly evident over a wide range of models and model configurations . These circulation changes influence the regional response, and are more pronounced over the ocean, because asymmetries in the land-sea response to changing concentrations of GHGs  amplify the maritime and dampen or even reverse the terrestrial signal . The dependence of the intensity of the hydrological cycle on the tropospheric cooling rate helps to explain why perturbations having the same RF do not produce the same precipitation responses. Apart from the relatively small increase in absorption by atmospheric water vapour, increased solar forcing does not directly affect the net tropospheric cooling rate. As a result the hydrological cycle mostly feels the subsequent warming through its influence on the rate of tropospheric cooling . This is why modeling studies suggest that solar radiation management  methods that maintain a constant surface temperature will lead to a reduction in globally averaged precipitation as well as different regional distributions of precipitation .	0
Figure 7.20 | Illustration of the response of the large-scale atmospheric overturning to warming . The overturning intensity is shown on the y-axis and is measured by the difference between the mean motion in upward moving air and the mean motion in downward moving air. The warming is shown on the x-axis and is measured by the change in surface temperature averaged over the Tropics, Ts, after an abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric CO2. The grey region delineates responses for which Ts is zero by definition. Nearly one half of the final reduction in the intensity of the overturning is evident before any warming is felt, and can be associated with a rapid adjustment of the hydrological cycle to changes in the atmospheric cooling rate accompanying a change in CO2. With warming the circulation intensity is further reduced. The rapid adjustment, as measured by the change in circulation intensity for zero warming, is different over land and ocean. Over land the increase in CO2 initially causes an intensification of the circulation. The result is robust in the sense that it is apparent in all of the 15 CMIP5 models analysed, irrespective of the details of their configuration.	0
Aerosol-cloud interactions directly influence the cloud microphysical structure, and only indirectly  the net atmospheric heating rate, and for this reason have mostly been explored in terms of their effect on the character and spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation, rather than on the globally-averaged amount of precipitation. The sensitivity of simulated clouds to their microphysical development  suggests that they may be susceptible to the availability of CCN and IN. For instance, an increase in CCN favours smaller cloud droplets, which delays the onset of precipitation and the formation of ice particles in convective clouds . It has been hypothesized that such changes may affect the vertical distribution and total amount of latent heating in ways that would intensify or invigorate convective storms, as measured by the strength and vertical extent of the convective updraughts . Support for the idea that the availability of CCN influences the vigour of convective systems can be found in some modelling studies, but the strength, and even sign, of such an effect has been shown to be contingent on a variety of environmental factors  as well as on modelling assumptions . Observational studies, based on large data sets that sample many convective systems, report systematic correlations between aerosol amount and cloud-top temperatures . Weekly cycles in cloud properties and precipitation, wherein convective intensity, cloud cover or precipitation increases during that part of the week when aerosol concentrations are largest, have also been reported . Both types of studies have been interpreted in terms of an aerosol influence on convective cloud systems. However, whether or not these findings demonstrate that a greater availability of CCN systematically invigorates, or otherwise affects, convection remains controversial. Many of the weekly cycle studies are disputed on statistical or other methodological grounds . Even in cases where relationships between aerosol amount and some measure of convective intensity appear to be unambiguous, the interpretation that this reflects an aerosol effect on the convection is less clear, as both aerosol properties and convection are strongly influenced by meteorological factors that 625	0
Because precipitation development in clouds is a time-dependent process, which proceeds at rates that are partly determined by the cloud microphysical structure , aerosol-cloud interactions may lead to shifts in topographic precipitation to the leeward side of mountains when precipitation is suppressed, or to the windward side in cases when it is more readily initiated. Orographic clouds show a reduction in the annual precipitation over topographical barriers downwind of major urban areas in some studies  but not in others . Even in cases where effects are reported, the results have proven sensitive to how the data are analysed . In summary, it is unclear whether changes in aerosol-cloud interactions arising from changes in the availability of CCN or IN can affect, and possibly intensify, the evolution of individual precipitating cloud systems. Some observational and modelling studies suggest such an effect, but are undermined by alternative interpretations of the observational evidence, and a lack of robustness in the modelling studies. The evidence for systematic effects over larger areas and long time periods is, if anything, more limited and ambiguous.	0
Precipitation within individual storms is expected to increase with the available moisture content in the atmosphere or near the surface rather than with the global precipitation , which leads to a 6 to 10% C-1 increase, but with longer intervals between storms . Because GCMs are generally poor at simulating precipitation extremes  and predicted changes in a warmer climate vary , they are not usually thought of as a source of reliable information regarding extremes. However, a recent study  shows that GCM predictions of extremes can be constrained by observable relationships in the present day climate, and upon doing so become broadly consistent with the idea that extreme precipitation increases by 6 to 10% per C of warming. Central estimates of sensitivity of extreme  626	0
daily rainfall to global temperature from this study were 10% C-1 in the tropics , compared to 5% C-1 predicted by the models in the extratropics, where they may be more reliable . How precipitation extremes depend on temperature has also been explored using cloud resolving simulations  which produce similar increases in extreme instantaneous rain rate  and daily or hourly rain totals  within storms . Because these latter studies are confined to small domains, they may exclude important synoptic or larger-scale dynamical changes such as increases in flow convergence . By taking advantage of natural variability in the present day climate, a number of studies have correlated observed rainfall extremes with local temperature variations. In the extratropics, these studies document sensitivities of extreme precipitation to temperature much higher than those reported above , but sensitivities vary with temperature , are often negative in the tropics  and usually strengthen at the shortest  time scales . However, local temperature changes may not be a good proxy for global warming because they tend to co-vary with other meteorological factors  in ways that are uncharacteristic of changes in the mean temperature , and these other meteorological factors may dominate the observed signal . Thus, the idea that precipitation extremes depend much more strongly on temperature than the 5 to	0
10% increase per degree Celsius attributable to water vapour changes, remains controversial. Following the AR4, studies have also continued to show that extremes in precipitation are associated with the coincidence of particular weather patterns . We currently lack an adequate understanding of what controls the return time and persistence of such rare events. From the aforementioned model and observational evidence, there is high confidence that the intensity of extreme precipitation events will increase with warming, at a rate well exceeding that of the mean precipitation. There is medium confidence that the increase is roughly 5 to 10% C-1 warming but may vary with time scale, location and season.	0
Geoengineering--also called climate engineering--is defined as a broad set of methods and technologies that aim to deliberately alter the climate system in order to alleviate impacts of climate change . Two main classes of geoengineering are often considered. Solar Radiation Management  proposes to counter the warming associated with increasing GHG concentrations by reducing the amount of sunlight absorbed at the surface. A related method seeks to alter high-altitude cirrus clouds to reduce their greenhouse effect. Another class of geoengineering called Carbon Dioxide Removal  is discussed in Section 6.5. This section assesses how the climate system might respond to some proposed SRM methods and related methods thought to have the potential to influence the global energy budget by at least a few tenths of a W m-2 but it does not assess technological or economical feasibility, or consider methods targeting specific climate impacts . Geoengineering is quite a new field of research, and there are relatively few studies focussed on it. Assessment of SRM is limited by  gaps in understanding of some important processes;  a relative scarcity of studies; and  a scarcity of studies using similar experimental design. This section discusses some aspects of SRM potential to mitigate global warming, outlines robust conclusions where they are apparent, and evaluates uncertainties and potential side effects. Additional impacts of SRM are assessed in Section 19.5.4 of the WGII report, while some of the socio-economic issues are assessed in Chapters 3, 6 and 13 of the WGIII report.	0
7.7.2.1 Stratospheric Aerosols Some SRM methods propose increasing the amount of stratospheric aerosol to produce a cooling effect like that observed after strong explosive volcanic eruptions . Recent studies have used numerical simulations and/or natural analogues to explore the possibility of forming sulphuric acid aerosols by injecting sulphur-containing gases into the stratosphere . Because aerosols eventually sediment out of the stratosphere , these methods require replenishment to maintain a given level of RF. Research has also begun to explore the efficacy of other types of aerosol particles  but the literature is much more limited and not assessed here. The RF depends on the choice of chemical species , sulphuric acid  or sprayed aerosols), location, rate and frequency of injection. The injection strategy affects particle size , with larger particles producing less RF  and more rapid sedimentation than smaller particles, affecting the efficacy of the method. The aerosol size distribution is controlled by an evolving balance between new particle formation, condensation of vapour on pre-existing particles, evaporation of particles, coagulation and sedimentation. Models that more fully account for aerosol processes  found smaller aerosol burdens, larger particles and weaker RF than earlier studies that prescribed the particle size over the particle lifetime. Current modeling studies indicate that injection of sulphate aerosol precursors of at least 10 Mt S  would be needed annually to maintain a RF of -4 W m-2, roughly equal but opposite to that associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 . Stratospheric aerosols may affect high clouds in the tropopause region, and one study  suggests significant negative forcing would result, but this is uncertain given limited understanding of ice nucleation in high clouds . Along with its potential to mitigate some aspects of global warming, the potential side effects of SRM must also be considered. Tilmes et al.  estimated that stratospheric aerosols SRM might increase chemical ozone loss at high latitudes and delay recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole  by 30 to 70 years, with changes in column ozone of -3 to -10% in polar latitudes and +3 to +5% in the tropics. A high latitude ozone loss is expected to increase UV radiation reaching the surface there, although the effect would be partially compensated by the increase in attenuation by the aerosol itself . A decrease in direct radiation and increase in diffuse radiation reaching the Earth's surface would occur and would be expected to increase photosynthesis in terrestrial ecosystems  and decrease the efficiency of some solar energy technologies . Models indicate that stratospheric aerosol SRM would not pose a surface acidification threat with maximum acid deposition rates estimated to be at least 500 times less than the threshold of concern for the most sensitive land ecosystems (Kuylenstierna et al., 627	0
7.7.2.2 Cloud Brightening Boundary layer clouds act to cool the planet, and relatively small changes in albedo or areal extent of low cloud can have profound effects on the Earth's radiation budget . Theoretical, modelling and observational studies show that the albedo of these types of cloud systems are susceptible to changes in their droplet concentrations, but the detection and quantification of RF attributable to such effects is difficult to separate from meteorological variability . Nonetheless, by systematically introducing CCN into the marine boundary layer, it should be possible to locally increase boundary layer cloud albedo as discussed in Section 7.4.2. These ideas underpin the method of cloud brightening, for instance through the direct injection  of sea-spray particles into cloud-forming air masses . An indirect cloud brightening mechanism through enhanced DMS production has also been proposed  but the efficacy of the DMS mechanism is disputed . The seeding of cloud layers with a propensity to precipitate may change cloud structure  and/or increase liquid water content , in either case changing albedo and producing strong negative forcing. A variety of methods have been used to identify which cloud regions are most susceptible to an aerosol change . Marine stratocumulus clouds with relatively weak precipitation are thought to be an optimal cloud type for brightening because of their relatively low droplet concentrations, their expected increase in cloud water in response to seeding , and the longer lifetime of sea salt particles in non- or weakly precipitating environments. Relatively strong local ERFaci  would be required to produce a global forcing of -1 to -5 W m-2 if only the more susceptible clouds were seeded.	0
ERFari) also found an increase in the amplitude of the ERF by 30 to 50% , thereby making the aerosol seeding more effective than previous estimates that neglected that effect. In summary, evidence that cloud brightening methods are effective and feasible in changing cloud reflectivity is ambiguous and subject to many of the uncertainties associated with aerosol-cloud interactions more broadly. If cloud brightening were to produce large local changes in ERF, those changes would affect the local energy budget, with further impacts on larger-scale oceanic and atmospheric circulations. Possible side effects accompanying such large and spatially heterogeneous changes in ERF have not been systematically studied.	0
7.7.2.3 Surface Albedo Changes A few studies have explored how planetary albedo might be increased by engineering local changes to the albedo of urban areas, croplands, grasslands, deserts and the ocean surface. Effects from whitening of urban areas have been estimated to yield a potential RF of -0.17 W m-2  although subsequent studies  suggest that this estimate may be at the upper end of what is achievable. Larger effects might be achievable by replacing native grassland or cropland with natural or bioengineered species with a larger albedo. A hypothetical 25% increase in grassland albedo could yield a RF as large as -0.5 W m-2 , with the maximum effect in the mid-latitudes during summer . The feasibility of increasing crop and grassland albedo remains unknown, and there could be side effects on photosynthetic activity, carbon uptake and biodiversity. The low albedo and large extent of oceanic surfaces mean that only a small increase in albedo, for example, by increasing the concentration of microbubbles in the surface layer of the ocean , could be sufficient to offset several W m-2 of RF by GHGs. Neither the extent of microbubble generation and persistence required for a significant climate impact, nor the potential side effects on the ocean circulation, air-sea fluxes and marine ecosystems have been assessed.	0
Simple modelling studies suggest that increasing droplet concentrations in marine boundary layer clouds by a factor of five or so  could produce an ERFaci of about -1 W m-2 if 5% of the ocean surface area were seeded, and an ERFaci as strong as -4 W m-2 if that fraction were increased to 75% . Subsequent studies with more complete treatments of aerosol-cloud interactions have produced both stronger  and weaker  changes. Because the initial response to cloud seeding is local, high-resolution, limited-domain simulations are especially useful to explore the efficacy of seeding. One recent study of this type  found that cloud brightening is sensitive to cloud dynamical adjustments that are difficult to treat in current GCMs  and concluded that the seeding rates initially proposed for cloud seeding may be insufficient to produce the desired cloud brightening. Recent studies accounting for clear-sky brightening from increased aerosol concentrations (i.e., 628	0
Although not strictly a form of SRM, proposals have been made to cool the planet by reducing the coverage or longwave opacity of high thin cirrus clouds, which act to warm the surface through their greenhouse effect . A proposal for doing so involves adding efficient IN in regions prone to forming thin cirrus cloud . To the extent such a proposal is feasible, one modelling study suggests that an ERFaci of as strong as -2 W m-2 could be achieved , with further negative forcing caused by a reduction in humidity of the upper troposphere associated with the cloud changes. However, lack of understanding of cirrus cloud formation processes, as well as ice microphysical processes , makes it difficult to judge the feasibility of such a method, particularly in light of the fact that increasing ice nucleation can also increase cirrus opacity, under some circumstances producing an opposite, positive forcing . Side effects specific to the `cirrus thinning' method have not been investigated.	0
As discussed elsewhere in this and other chapters of this assessment, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the climate response to forcing mechanisms. Geoengineering is also a relatively new field of research. The gaps in understanding, scarcity of studies and diversity in the model experimental design make quantitative model evaluation and intercomparison difficult, hindering an assessment of the efficacy and side effects of SRM. This motivates dividing the discussion into two sections, one that assesses idealized studies that focus on conceptual issues and searches for robust responses to simple changes in the balance between solar irradiance and CO2 forcing, and another discussing studies that more closely emulate specific SRM methods.	0
irradiance, which could approximate the radiative impact of space reflectors. Reductions in solar irradiance in particular regions  could also provide useful information. Idealized simulations often focus on the effects of a complete cancellation of the warming from GHGs, but the rate of warming is occasionally explored by producing a negative RF that partially cancels the anthropogenic forcing . They can also provide insight into the climate response to other SRM methods, and can provide a simple baseline for examining other SRM techniques. The most comprehensive and systematic evaluation of idealized SRM to date is the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project . Together with earlier model studies, this project found robust surface temperature reductions when the total solar irradiance is reduced: when this reduction compensates for CO2 RF, residual effects appear regionally, but they are much smaller than the warming due to the CO2 RF alone  The substantial warming from 4 x CO2 at high latitudes  is reduced to a warming of 0C to 3C near	0

High CO2 concentrations from anthropogenic emissions will persist in the atmosphere for more than a thousand years in the absence of active efforts to remove atmospheric CO2 . If SRM were used to counter positive forcing, it would be needed as long as the CO2 concentrations remained high . If GHG concentrations continued to increase, then the scale of SRM to offset the resulting warming would need to increase proportionally, amplifying residual effects from increasingly imperfect compensation. Figure 7.24 shows projections of the globally averaged surface temperature and precipitation changes associated with a 1% yr-1 CO2 increase, with and without SRM. The scenario includes a hypothetical, abrupt termination of SRM at year 50, which could happen due to any number of unforeseeable circumstances. After this event, all the simulations predict a return to temperature levels consistent with the CO2 forcing within one to two decades , and with a large rate of temperature change . Precipitation, which drops by 1% over the SRM period, rapidly returns to levels consistent with the CO2 forcing upon SRM termination. The very rapid warming would probably affect ecosystem and human adaptation, and would also weaken carbon sinks, accelerating atmospheric CO2 accumulation and contributing to further warming .	0
stability that leads to less global precipitation as seen in Figures 7.22c, d and 7.23e-g  and discussed in Section 7.6.3. The reduction in precipitation shows similarities to the climate response induced by the Pinatubo eruption . Although the impact of changes in the total solar irradiance on global mean precipitation is well understood and robust in models, there is less understanding and agreement among models in the spatial pattern of the precipitation changes. Modelling studies suggest that some residual patterns may be robust , but a physical explanation for these changes is lacking. Some model results indicate that an asymmetric hemispheric SRM forcing would induce changes in some regional precipitation patterns .	0
Several studies examined the model response to more realistic stratospheric aerosol SRM . These studies produced varying aerosol burdens, and RF and model responses also varied more strongly than in idealized experiments. Although these studies differ in details, their climate responses were generally consistent with the idealized experiments described in Section 7.7.3.1. Studies treating the interaction between the carbon cycle, the hydrologic cycle, and SRM indicate that SRM could affect the temperaturedriven suppression of some carbon sinks, and that the increased stomatal resistance with increased CO2 concentrations combined with less warming, may further affect the hydrological cycle over land , with larger impacts on precipitation for stratospheric aerosol SRM than for a uniform reduction in incoming sunlight. Coupled ocean-atmosphere-sea ice models have also been used to assess the climate impacts of cloud brightening due to droplet concentration changes . The patterns of temperature and precipitation change differ substantially between models. These studies showed larger residual temperature changes than the idealized SRM studies, with more pronounced cooling over the regions of enhanced albedo. The cooling over the seeded regions  631	0
FAQ 7.3 | Could Geoengineering Counteract Climate Change and What Side Effects Might Occur? Geoengineering--also called climate engineering--is defined as a broad set of methods and technologies that aim to deliberately alter the climate system in order to alleviate impacts of climate change. Two distinct categories of geoengineering methods are usually considered: Solar Radiation Management  aims to offset the warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases by making the planet more reflective while Carbon Dioxide Removal  aims at reducing the atmospheric CO2 concentration. The two categories operate on different physical principles and on different time scales. Models suggest that if SRM methods were realizable they would be effective in countering increasing temperatures, and would be less, but still, effective in countering some other climate changes. SRM would not counter all effects of climate change, and all proposed geoengineering methods also carry risks and side effects. Additional consequences cannot yet be anticipated as the level of scientific understanding about both SRM and CDR is low. There are also many  issues involving geoengineering that are beyond the scope of this report. Carbon Dioxide Removal Methods CDR methods aim at removing CO2 from the atmosphere by deliberately modifying carbon cycle processes, or by industrial  approaches. The carbon withdrawn from the atmosphere would then be stored in land, ocean or in geological reservoirs. Some CDR methods rely on biological processes, such as large-scale afforestation/ reforestation, carbon sequestration in soils through biochar, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  and ocean fertilization. Others would rely on geological processes, such as accelerated weathering of silicate and carbonate rocks--on land or in the ocean . The CO2 removed from the atmosphere would	0
FAQ 7.3, Figure 1 | Overview of some proposed geoengineering methods as they have been suggested. Carbon Dioxide Removal methods :  nutrients are added to the ocean , which increases oceanic productivity in the surface ocean and transports a fraction of the resulting biogenic carbon downward;  alkalinity from solid minerals is added to the ocean, which causes more atmospheric CO2 to dissolve in the ocean;  the weathering rate of silicate rocks is increased, and the dissolved carbonate minerals are transported to the ocean;  atmospheric CO2 is captured chemically, and stored either underground or in the ocean;  biomass is burned at an electric power plant with carbon capture, and the captured CO2 is stored either underground or in the ocean; and  CO2 is captured through afforestation and reforestation to be stored in land ecosystems. Solar Radiation Management methods :  reflectors are placed in space to reflect solar radiation;  aerosols are injected in the stratosphere;  marine clouds are seeded in order to be made more reflective;  microbubbles are produced at the ocean surface to make it more reflective;  more reflective crops are grown; and  roofs and other built structures are whitened.	0
then be stored in organic form in land reservoirs, or in inorganic form in oceanic and geological reservoirs, where it would have to be stored for at least hundreds of years for CDR to be effective. CDR methods would reduce the radiative forcing of CO2 inasmuch as they are effective at removing CO2 from the atmosphere and keeping the removed carbon away from the atmosphere. Some methods would also reduce ocean acidification , but other methods involving oceanic storage might instead increase ocean acidification if the carbon is sequestered as dissolved CO2. A major uncertainty related to the effectiveness of CDR methods is the storage capacity and the permanence of stored carbon. Permanent carbon removal and storage by CDR would decrease climate warming in the long term. However, non-permanent storage strategies would allow CO2 to return back to the atmosphere where it would once again contribute to warming. An intentional removal of CO2 by CDR methods will be partially offset by the response of the oceanic and terrestrial carbon reservoirs if the CO2 atmospheric concentration is reduced. This is because some oceanic and terrestrial carbon reservoirs will outgas to the atmosphere the anthropogenic CO2 that had previously been stored. To completely offset past anthropogenic CO2 emissions, CDR techniques would therefore need to remove not just the CO2 that has accumulated in the atmosphere since pre-industrial times, but also the anthropogenic carbon previously taken up by the terrestrial biosphere and the ocean. Biological and most chemical weathering CDR methods cannot be scaled up indefinitely and are necessarily limited by various physical or environmental constraints such as competing demands for land. Assuming a maximum CDR sequestration rate of 200 PgC per century from a combination of CDR methods, it would take about one and half centuries to remove the CO2 emitted in the last 50 years, making it difficult--even for a suite of additive CDR methods--to mitigate climate change rapidly. Direct air capture methods could in principle operate much more rapidly, but may be limited by large-scale implementation, including energy use and environmental constraints. CDR could also have climatic and environmental side effects. For instance, enhanced vegetation productivity may increase emissions of N2O, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. A large-scale increase in vegetation coverage, for instance through afforestation or energy crops, could alter surface characteristics, such as surface reflectivity and turbulent fluxes. Some modelling studies have shown that afforestation in seasonally snow-covered boreal regions could in fact accelerate global warming, whereas afforestation in the tropics may be more effective at slowing global warming. Ocean-based CDR methods that rely on biological production  would have numerous side effects on ocean ecosystems, ocean acidity and may produce emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Solar Radiation Management Methods The globally averaged surface temperature of the planet is strongly influenced by the amount of sunlight absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere and surface, which warms the planet, and by the existence of the greenhouse effect, the process by which greenhouse gases and clouds affect the way energy is eventually radiated back to space. An increase in the greenhouse effect leads to a surface temperature rise until a new equilibrium is found. If less incoming sunlight is absorbed because the planet has been made more reflective, or if energy can be emitted to space more effectively because the greenhouse effect is reduced, the average global surface temperature will be reduced. Suggested geoengineering methods that aim at managing the Earth's incoming and outgoing energy flows are based on this fundamental physical principle. Most of these methods propose to either reduce sunlight reaching the Earth or increase the reflectivity of the planet by making the atmosphere, clouds or the surface brighter . Another technique proposes to suppress high-level clouds called cirrus, as these clouds have a strong greenhouse effect. Basic physics tells us that if any of these methods change energy flows as expected, then the planet will cool. The picture is complicated, however, because of the many and complex physical processes which govern the interactions between the flow of energy, the atmospheric circulation, weather and the resulting climate. While the globally averaged surface temperature of the planet will respond to a change in the amount of sunlight reaching the surface or a change in the greenhouse effect, the temperature at any given location and time is influenced by many other factors and the amount of cooling from SRM will not in general equal the amount of warming caused by greenhouse gases. For example, SRM will change heating rates only during daytime, but increasing greenhouse gases can change temperatures during both day and night. This inexact compensation can influence 	0
the diurnal cycle of surface temperature, even if the average surface temperature is unchanged. As another example, model calculations suggest that a uniform decrease in sunlight reaching the surface might offset global mean CO2-induced warming, but some regions will cool less than others. Models suggest that if anthropogenic greenhouse warming were completely compensated by stratospheric aerosols, then polar regions would be left with a small residual warming, while tropical regions would become a little cooler than in pre-industrial times. SRM could theoretically counteract anthropogenic climate change rapidly, cooling the Earth to pre-industrial levels within one or two decades. This is known from climate models but also from the climate records of large volcanic eruptions. The well-observed eruption of Mt Pinatubo in 1991 caused a temporary increase in stratospheric aerosols and a rapid decrease in surface temperature of about 0.5C.	0
SRM techniques would probably have other side effects. For example, theory, observation and models suggest that stratospheric sulphate aerosols from volcanic eruptions and natural emissions deplete stratospheric ozone, especially while chlorine from chlorofluorocarbon emissions resides in the atmosphere. Stratospheric aerosols introduced for SRM are expected to have the same effect. Ozone depletion would increase the amount of ultraviolet light reaching the surface damaging terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Stratospheric aerosols would also increase the ratio of direct to diffuse sunlight reaching the surface, which generally increases plant productivity. There has also been some concern that sulphate aerosol SRM would increase acid rain, but model studies suggest that acid rain is probably not a major concern since the rate of acid rain production from stratospheric aerosol SRM would be much smaller than values currently produced by pollution sources. SRM will also not address the ocean acidification associated with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and its impacts on marine ecosystems.	0
Climate consists of many factors besides surface temperature. Consequences for other climate features, such as rainfall, soil moisture, river flow, snowpack and sea ice, and ecosystems may also be important. Both models and theory show that compensating an increased greenhouse effect with SRM to stabilize surface temperature would somewhat lower the globally averaged rainfall , and there also could be regional changes. Such imprecise compensation in 3 regional and global climate patterns makes it improbable that SRM  will produce a future climate that is `just like' the one we experi2.5 ence today, or have experienced in the past. However, available 2 climate models indicate that a geoengineered climate with SRM and high atmospheric CO2 levels would be generally closer to 20th 1.5 century climate than a future climate with elevated CO2 concentra1 tions and no SRM.	0
and a warmer North Pacific adjacent to a cooler northwestern Canada, produced a SST response with a La Nina-like pattern. One study has noted regional shifts in the potential hurricane intensity and hurricane genesis potential index in the Atlantic Ocean and South China Sea in response to cloud brightening , due primarily to decreases in vertical wind shear, but overall the investigation and identification of robust side effects has not been extensively explored. Irvine et al.  tested the impact of increasing desert albedo up to 0.80 in a climate model. This cooled surface temperature by -1.1C  and produced very significant changes in regional precipitation patterns.	0
Theory, model studies and observations suggest that some SRM methods may be able to counteract a portion of global warming effects  due to high concentrations of anthropogenic GHGs . But the level of understanding about SRM is low, and it is difficult to assess feasibility and efficacy because of remaining uncertainties in important climate processes and the interactions among those processes. Although SRM research is still in its infancy, enough is known to identify some potential benefits, which must be weighed against known side effects . All studies suggest there would be a small but measurable decrease in global precipitation from SRM. Other side effects are specific to specific methods, and a number of research areas remain largely unexplored. There are also features that develop as a consequence of the combination of high CO2 and SRM . SRM counters only some consequences of elevated CO2 concentrations; it does not in particular address ocean acidification.	0
by the imprecise compensation between SRM and CO2 forcing would also increase. If SRM were terminated for any reason, a rapid increase in surface temperatures  to values consistent with the high GHG forcing would result . This rate of climate change would far exceed what would have occurred without geoengineering, causing any impacts related to the rate of change to be correspondingly greater than they would have been without geoengineering. In contrast, SRM in concert with aggressive CO2 mitigation might conceivably help avoid transitions across climate thresholds or tipping points that would be unavoidable otherwise.	0
Many model studies indicate that stratospheric aerosol SRM could counteract some changes resulting from GHG increases that produce a RF as strong as 4 W m-2 , but they disagree on details. Marine cloud brightening SRM has received less attention, and there is no consensus on its efficacy, in large part due to the high level of uncertainty about cloud radiative responses to aerosol changes. There have been fewer studies and much less attention focused on all other SRM methods, and it is not currently possible to provide a general assessment of their specific efficacy, scalability, side effects and risks. There is robust agreement among models and high confidence that the compensation between GHG warming and SRM cooling is imprecise. SRM would not produce a future climate identical to the present  climate. Nonetheless, although models disagree on details, they consistently suggest that a climate with SRM and high atmospheric CO2 levels would be closer to that of the last century than a world with elevated CO2 concentrations and no SRM , as long as the SRM could be continuously sustained and calibrated to offset the forcing by GHGs. Aerosol-based methods would, however, require a continuous program of replenishment to achieve this. If CO2 concentrations and SRM were increased in concert, the risks and residual climate change produced	0

Executive Summary It is unequivocal that anthropogenic increases in the well-mixed greenhouse gases  have substantially enhanced the greenhouse effect, and the resulting forcing continues to increase. Aerosols partially offset the forcing of the WMGHGs and dominate the uncertainty associated with the total anthropogenic driving of climate change. As in previous IPCC assessments, AR5 uses the radiative forcing1  concept, but it also introduces effective radiative forcing2 . The RF concept has been used for many years and in previous IPCC assessments for evaluating and comparing the strength of the various mechanisms affecting the Earth's radiation balance and thus causing climate change. Whereas in the RF concept all surface and tropospheric conditions are kept fixed, the ERF calculations presented here allow all physical variables to respond to perturbations except for those concerning the ocean and sea ice. The inclusion of these adjustments makes ERF a better indicator of the eventual temperature response. ERF and RF values are significantly different for anthropogenic aerosols owing to their influence on clouds and on snow cover. These changes to clouds are rapid adjustments and occur on a time scale much faster than responses of the ocean  to forcing. RF and ERF are estimated over the Industrial Era from 1750 to 2011 if other periods are not explicitly stated. 	0
Industrial-Era Anthropogenic Forcing The total anthropogenic ERF over the Industrial Era is 2.3  W m-2.3 It is certain that the total anthropogenic ERF is positive. Total anthropogenic ERF has increased more rapidly since 1970 than during prior decades. The total anthropogenic ERF estimate for 2011 is 43% higher compared to the AR4 RF estimate for the year 2005 owing to reductions in estimated forcing due to aerosols but also to continued growth in greenhouse gas RF. Due to increased concentrations, RF from WMGHGs has increased by 0.20  W m-2  since the AR4 estimate for the year 2005. The RF of WMGHG is 2.83  W m-2. The majority of this change since AR4 is due to increases in the carbon dioxide  RF of nearly 10%. The Industrial Era RF for CO2 alone is 1.82  W m-2, and CO2 is the component with the largest global mean RF. Over the last decade RF of CO2 has an average growth rate of 0.27  W m-2 per decade. Emissions of CO2 have made the largest contribution to the increased anthropogenic forcing in every decade since the 1960s. The best estimate for ERF of	0
WMGHG is the same as the RF but with a larger uncertainty . Ozone and stratospheric water vapour contribute substantially to RF. The total RF estimated from modelled ozone changes is 0.35  W m-2, with RF due to tropospheric ozone changes of 0.40  W m-2 and due to stratospheric ozone changes of -0.05  W m-2. Ozone is not emitted directly into the atmosphere but is formed by photochemical reactions. Tropospheric ozone RF is largely attributed to anthropogenic emissions of methane , nitrogen oxides , carbon monoxide  and non-methane volatile organic compounds , while stratospheric ozone RF results primarily from ozone depletion by halocarbons. Estimates are also provided attributing RF to emitted compounds. Ozone-depleting substances  cause ozone RF of -0.15  W m-2, some of which is in the troposphere. Tropospheric ozone precursors cause ozone RF of 0.50  W m-2, some of which is in the stratosphere; this value is larger than that in AR4. There is robust evidence that tropospheric ozone also has a detrimental impact on vegetation physiology, and therefore on its CO2 uptake, but there is a low confidence on quantitative estimates of the RF owing to this indirect effect. RF for stratospheric water vapour produced by CH4 oxidation is 0.07  W m-2. The RF best estimates for ozone and stratospheric	0
The magnitude of the aerosol forcing is reduced relative to AR4. The RF due to aerosol-radiation interactions, sometimes referred to as direct aerosol effect, is given a best estimate of -0.35  W m-2, and black carbon  on snow and ice is 0.04  W m-2. The ERF due to aerosol-radiation interactions is -0.45  W m-2. A total aerosol-cloud interaction5 is quantified in terms of the ERF concept with an estimate of -0.45  W m-2. The total aerosol effect  is estimated as ERF of -0.9  W m-2. The large uncertainty in aerosol ERF is the dominant contributor to overall net Industrial Era forcing uncertainty. Since AR4, more aerosol processes have been included in models, and differences between models and observations persist, resulting in similar uncertainty in the aerosol forcing as in AR4. Despite the large uncertainty range, there is a high confidence that aerosols have offset a substantial portion of WMGHG global mean forcing. 	0
Natural Forcing Satellite observations of total solar irradiance  changes from 1978 to 2011 show that the most recent solar cycle minimum was lower than the prior two. This very likely led to a small negative RF of -0.04  W m-2 between 1986 and 2008. The best estimate of RF due to TSI changes representative for the 1750 to 2011 period is 0.05  W m-2. This is substantially smaller than the AR4 estimate due to the addition of the latest solar cycle and inconsistencies in how solar RF has been estimated in earlier IPCC assessments. There is very low confidence concerning future solar forcing estimates, but there is high confidence that the TSI RF variations will be much smaller than the projected increased forcing due to GHG during the forthcoming decades. 	0
Emission metrics such as Global Warming Potential  and Global Temperature change Potential  can be used to quantify and communicate the relative and absolute contributions to climate change of emissions of different substances, and of emissions from regions/countries or sources/sectors. The metric that has been used in policies is the GWP, which integrates the RF of a substance over a chosen time horizon, relative to that of CO2. The GTP is the ratio of change in global mean surface temperature at a chosen point in time from the substance of interest relative to that from CO2. There are significant uncertainties related to both GWP and GTP, and the relative uncertainties are larger for GTP. There are also limitations and inconsistencies related to their treatment of indirect effects and feedbacks. The values are very dependent on metric type and time horizon. The choice of metric and time horizon depends on the particular application and which aspects of climate change are considered relevant in a given context. Metrics do not define policies or goals but facilitate evaluation and implementation of multi-component policies to meet particular goals. All choices of metric contain implicit value-related judgements such as type of effect considered and weighting of effects over time. This assessment provides updated values of both GWP and GTP for many compounds. 	0
There are a variety of ways to examine how various drivers contribute to climate change. In principle, observations of the climate response to a single factor could directly show the impact of that factor, or climate models could be used to study the impact of any single factor. In practice, however, it is usually difficult to find measurements that are influenced by only a single cause, and it is computationally prohibitive to simulate the response to every individual factor of interest. Hence various metrics intermediate between cause and effect are used to provide estimates of the climate impact of individual factors, with applications both in science and policy. Radiative forcing  is one of the most widely used metrics, with most other metrics based on RF. In this chapter, we discuss RF from natural and anthropogenic components during the industrial period, presenting values for 2011 relative to 1750 unless otherwise stated, and projected values through 2100 . In this section, we present the various definitions of RF used in this chapter, and discuss the utility and limitations of RF. These definitions are used in the subsequent sections quantifying the RF due to specific anthropogenic  and natural  causes and integrating RF due to all causes . Atmospheric chemistry relevant for RF is discussed in Section 8.2 and used throughout the chapter. Emission metrics using RF that are designed to facilitate rapid evaluation and comparison of the climate effects of emissions are discussed in Section 8.7.	0
excluded from this definition of forcing. The assumed relation between a sustained RF and the equilibrium global mean surface temperature response  is DT = lRF where l is the climate sensitivity parameter. The relationship between RF and DT is an expression of the energy balance of the climate system and a simple reminder that the steadystate global mean climate response to a given forcing is determined both by the forcing and the responses inherent in l. Implicit in the concept of RF is the proposition that the change in net irradiance in response to the imposed forcing alone can be separated from all subsequent responses to the forcing. These are not in fact always clearly separable and thus some ambiguity exists in what may be considered a forcing versus what is part of the climate response. In both the Third Assessment Report  and AR4, the term radiative forcing  was defined as the change in net irradiance at the tropopause after allowing for stratospheric temperatures to readjust to radiative equilibrium, while holding surface and tropospheric temperatures and state variables such as water vapour and cloud cover fixed at the unperturbed values8. RF is generally more indicative of the surface and tropospheric temperature responses than instantaneous RF, especially for agents such as carbon dioxide  or ozone  change that substantially alter stratospheric temperatures. To be consistent with TAR and AR4, RF is hereafter taken to mean the stratospherically adjusted RF.	0
RF is the net change in the energy balance of the Earth system due to some imposed perturbation. It is usually expressed in watts per square meter averaged over a particular period of time and quantifies the energy imbalance that occurs when the imposed change takes place. Though usually difficult to observe, calculated RF provides a simple quantitative basis for comparing some aspects of the potential climate response to different imposed agents, especially global mean temperature, and hence is widely used in the scientific community. Forcing is often presented as the value due to changes between two particular times, such as pre-industrial to present-day, while its time evolution provides a more complete picture.	0
For many forcing agents the RF gives a very useful and appropriate way to compare the relative importance of their potential climate effect. Instantaneous RF or RF is not an accurate indicator of the temperature response for all forcing agents, however. Rapid adjustments in the troposphere can either enhance or reduce the flux perturbations, leading to substantial differences in the forcing driving long-term climate change. In much the same way that allowing for the relatively rapid adjustment of stratospheric temperatures provides a more useful characterization of the forcing due to stratospheric constituent changes, inclusion of rapid tropospheric adjustments has the potential to provide more useful characterization for drivers in the troposphere .	0
see Section 7.4). Although these adjustments are complex and not fully quantified, they occur both on the microphysical scale of the cloud particles as well as on a more macroscopic scale involving whole cloud systems . A portion of these adjustments occurs over a short period, on cloud life cycle time scales, and is not part of a feedback arising from the surface temperature changes. Previously these type of adjustments were sometimes termed `fast feedbacks' , whereas in AR5 they are denoted `rapid adjustments' to emphasize their distinction from feedbacks involving surface temperature changes. Atmospheric chemistry responses have typically been included under the RF framework, and hence could also be included in a forcing encompassing rapid adjustments, which is important when evaluating forcing attributable to emissions changes  and in the calculation of emission metrics . Studies have demonstrated the utility of including rapid adjustment in comparison of forcing agents, especially in allowing quantification of forcing due to aerosol-induced changes in clouds  that are not amenable to characterization by RF . Several measures of forcing have been introduced that include rapid adjustments. We term a forcing that accounts for rapid adjustments the effective radiative forcing . Conceptually, ERF represents the change in net TOA downward radiative flux after allowing for atmospheric temperatures, water vapour and clouds to adjust, but with global mean surface temperature or a portion of surface conditions unchanged. The primary methods in use for such calculations are  fixing sea surface temperatures  and sea ice cover at climatological values while allowing all other parts of the system to respond until reaching steady state  or  analyzing the transient global mean surface temperature response to an instantaneous perturbation and using the regression of the response extrapolated back to the start of the simulation to derive	0
the initial ERF . The ERF calculated using the regression technique has an uncertainty of about 10%  for a single 4 x CO2 simulation  due to internal variability in the transient climate , while given a similar length simulation the uncertainty due to internal variability in ERF calculated using the fixed-SST technique is much smaller and hence the latter may be more suitable for very small forcings. Analysis of both techniques shows that the fixed-SST method yields a smaller spread across models, even in calculations neglecting the uncertainty in the regression fitting procedure . As a portion of land area responses are included in the fixed-SST technique, however, that ERF is slightly less than it would be with surface temperature held fixed everywhere. It is possible to adjust for this in the global mean forcing, though we do not include such a correction here as we examine regional as well as global ERF, but the land response will also introduce artificial gradients in land-sea temperatures that could cause small local climate responses. In contrast, there is no global mean temperature response included in the regression method. Despite the low bias in fixed-SST ERF due to land responses, results from a multi-model analysis of the forcing due to CO2 are 7% greater using this method than using the regression technique  though this is within the uncertainty range of the calculations. Although each technique has advantages, forcing diagnosed using the fixed-SST method is available for many more forcing agents in the current generation of climate models than forcing diagnosed using the regression method. Hence for practical purposes, ERF is hereafter used for results from the fixed-SST technique unless otherwise stated . The conceptual relation between instantaneous RF, RF and ERF is illustrated in Figure 8.1. It implies the adjustments to the instantaneous RF involve effects of processes that occur more rapidly than the time scale of the response of the global mean surface temperature to the forcing. However, there is no a priori time scale defined for adjustments to be rapid with the fixed-SST method. The majority take place on time scales	0
Box 8.1 | Definition of Radiative Forcing and Effective Radiative Forcing The two most commonly used measures of radiative forcing in this chapter are the radiative forcing  and the effective radiative forcing . RF is defined, as it was in AR4, as the change in net downward radiative flux at the tropopause after allowing for stratospheric temperatures to readjust to radiative equilibrium, while holding surface and tropospheric temperatures and state variables such as water vapor and cloud cover fixed at the unperturbed values. ERF is the change in net TOA downward radiative flux after allowing for atmospheric temperatures, water vapour and clouds to adjust, but with surface temperature or a portion of surface conditions unchanged. Although there are multiple methods to calculate ERF, we take ERF to mean the method in which sea surface temperatures and sea ice cover are fixed at climatological values unless otherwise specified. Land surface properties  are allowed to adjust in this method. Hence ERF includes both the effects of the forcing agent itself and the rapid adjustments to that agent . In the case of aerosols, the rapid adjustments of clouds encompass effects that have been referred to as indirect or semi-direct forcings , with some of these same cloud responses also taking place for other forcing agents . Calculation of ERF requires longer simulations with more complex models than calculation of RF, but the inclusion of the additional rapid adjustments makes ERF a better indicator of the eventual global mean temperature response, especially for aerosols. When forcing is attributed to emissions or used for calculation of emission metrics, additional responses including atmospheric chemistry and the carbon cycle are also included in both RF and ERF . The general term forcing is used to refer to both RF and ERF. 665	0
Water vapour is the primary greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere. The contribution of water vapour to the natural greenhouse effect relative to that of carbon dioxide  depends on the accounting method, but can be considered to be approximately two to three times greater. Additional water vapour is injected into the atmosphere from anthropogenic activities, mostly through increased evaporation from irrigated crops, but also through power plant cooling, and marginally through the combustion of fossil fuel. One may therefore question why there is so much focus on CO2, and not on water vapour, as a forcing to climate change. Water vapour behaves differently from CO2 in one fundamental way: it can condense and precipitate. When air with high humidity cools, some of the vapour condenses into water droplets or ice particles and precipitates. The typical residence time of water vapour in the atmosphere is ten days. The flux of water vapour into the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources is considerably less than from `natural' evaporation. Therefore, it has a negligible impact on overall concentrations, and does not contribute significantly to the long-term greenhouse effect. This is the main reason why tropospheric water vapour  is not considered to be an anthropogenic gas contributing to radiative forcing. Anthropogenic emissions do have a significant impact on water vapour in the stratosphere, which is the part of the atmosphere above about 10 km. Increased concentrations of methane  due to human activities lead to an additional source of water, through oxidation, which partly explains the observed changes in that atmospheric layer. That stratospheric water change has a radiative impact, is considered a forcing, and can be evaluated. Stratospheric concentrations of water have varied significantly in past decades. The full extent of these variations is not well understood and is probably less a forcing than a feedback process added to natural variability. The T -4 T -2 T T +2 T +4 Temperature change contribution of stratospheric water vapour to warm1.4 ing, both forcing and feedback, is much smaller than 1.2 from CH4 or CO2. 0	0
The maximum amount of water vapour in the air is controlled by temperature. A typical column of air extending from the surface to the stratosphere in polar regions may contain only a few kilograms of water vapour per square metre, while a similar column of air in the tropics may contain up to 70 kg. With every extra degree of air temperature, the atmosphere can retain around 7% more water vapour . This increase in concentration amplifies the greenhouse effect, and therefore leads to more warming. This process, referred to as the water vapour feedback, is well understood and quantified. It occurs in all models used to estimate climate change, where its strength is consistent with observations. Although an increase in atmospheric water vapour has been observed, this change is recognized as a climate feedback  and should not be interpreted as a radiative forcing from anthropogenic emissions. 	0
Currently, water vapour has the largest greenhouse effect in the Earth's atmosphere. However, other greenhouse gases, primarily CO2, are necessary to sustain the presence of water vapour in the atmosphere. Indeed, if these other gases were removed from the atmosphere, its temperature would drop sufficiently to induce a decrease of water vapour, leading to a runaway drop of the greenhouse effect that would plunge the Earth into a frozen state. So greenhouse gases other than water vapour provide the temperature structure that sustains current levels of atmospheric water vapour. Therefore, although CO2 is the main anthropogenic control knob on climate, water vapour is a strong and fast feedback that amplifies any initial forcing by a typical factor between two and three. Water vapour is not a significant initial forcing, but is nevertheless a fundamental agent of climate change.	0
of seasons or less, but there is a spectrum of adjustment times. Changes in land ice and snow cover, for instance, may take place over many years. The ERF thus represents that part of the instantaneous RF that is maintained over long time scales and more directly contributes to the steady-state climate response. The RF can be considered a more limited version of ERF. Because the atmospheric temperature has been allowed to adjust, ERF would be nearly identical if calculated at the tropopause instead of the TOA for tropospheric forcing agents, as would RF. Recent work has noted likely advantages of the ERF framework for understanding model responses to CO2 as well as to more complex forcing agents . The climate sensitivity parameter  derived with respect to RF can vary substantially across different forcing agents . The response to RF from a particular agent relative to the response to RF from CO2 has been termed the efficacy . By including many of the rapid adjustments that differ across forcing agents, the ERF concept includes much of their relative efficacy and therefore leads to more uniform climate sensitivity across agents. For example, the influence of clouds on the interaction of aerosols with sunlight and the effect of aerosol heating on cloud formation can lead to very large differences in the response per unit RF from black carbon  located at different altitudes, but the response per unit ERF is nearly uniform with altitude . Hence as we use ERF in this chapter when it differs significantly from RF, efficacy is not used hereinafter. For inhomogeneous forcings, we note that the climate sensitivity parameter may also depend on the horizontal forcing distribution, especially with latitude . A combination of RF and ERF will be used in this chapter with RF provided to keep consistency with TAR and AR4, and ERF used to allow quantification of more complex forcing agents and, in some cases, provide a more useful metric than RF.	0
isolate the ERF of small forcings that are easily isolated in the pair of radiative transfer calculations performed for RF . For RF, on the other hand, a definition of the tropopause is required, which can be ambiguous. In many cases, however, ERF and RF are nearly equal. Analysis of 11 models from the current Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  generation finds that the rapid adjustments to CO2 cause fixed-SST-based ERF to be 2% less than RF, with an intermodel standard deviation of 7% . This is consistent with an earlier study of six GCMs that found a substantial inter-model variation in the rapid tropospheric adjustment to CO2 using regression analysis in slab ocean models, though the ensemble mean adjustment was less than 5% . Part of the large uncertainty range arises from the greater noise inherent in regression analyses of single runs in comparison with fixed-SST experiments. Using fixed-SST simulations, Hansen et al.  found that ERF is virtually identical to RF for increased CO2, tropospheric ozone and solar irradiance, and within 6% for methane , nitrous oxide , stratospheric aerosols and for the aerosol-radiation interaction of reflective aerosols. Shindell et al.  also found that RF and ERF are statistically equal for tropospheric ozone. Lohmann et al.  report a small increase in the forcing from CO2 using ERF instead of RF based on the fixed-SST technique, while finding no substantial difference for CH4, RF due to aerosol-radiation interactions or aerosol effects on cloud albedo. In the fixed-SST simulations of Hansen et al. , ERF was about 20% less than RF for the atmospheric effects of BC aerosols , and nearly 300% greater for the forcing due to BC snow albedo forcing . ERF was slightly greater than RF for stratospheric ozone in Hansen et al. , but the opposite is true for more recent analyses , and hence it seems most appropriate at present to use RF for this small forcing. The various studies demonstrate that RF provides a good estimate of ERF in most cases, as the differences are very small, with the notable exceptions of BC-related forcings . ERF provides better characterization of those effects, as well as allowing quantification of a broader range of effects including all aerosol-cloud interactions. Hence while RF and ERF are generally quite similar for WMGHGs, ERF typically provides a more useful indication of climate response for near-term climate forcers . As the rapid adjustments included in ERF differ in strength across climate models, the uncertainty range for ERF estimates tends to be larger than the range for RF estimates. 667	0
We define as `well-mixed' those greenhouse gases that are sufficiently mixed throughout the troposphere that concentration measurements from a few remote surface sites can characterize the climate-relevant atmospheric burden; although these gases may still have local variation near sources and sinks and even small hemispheric gradients. Global forcing per unit emission and emission metrics for these gases thus do not depend on the geographic location of the emission, and forcing calculations can assume even horizontal distributions. These gases, or a subset of them, have sometimes been referred to as `long-lived greenhouse gases' as they are well mixed because their atmospheric lifetimes are much greater than the time scale of a few years for atmospheric mixing, but the physical property that causes the aforementioned common characteristics is more directly associated with their mixing within the atmosphere. WMGHGs include CO2, N2O, CH4, SF6, and many halogenated species. Conversely, ozone is not a WMGHG. We define `near-term climate forcers'  as those compounds whose impact on climate occurs primarily within the first decade after their emission. This set of compounds is composed primarily of those with short lifetimes in the atmosphere compared to WMGHGs, and has been sometimes referred to as short-lived climate forcers or short-lived climate pollutants. However, the common property that is of greatest interest to a climate assessment is the time scale over which their impact on climate is felt. This set of compounds includes methane, which is also a WMGHG, as well as ozone and aerosols, or their precursors, and some halogenated species that are not WMGHGs. These compounds do not accumulate in the atmosphere at decadal to centennial time scales, and so their effect on climate is predominantly in the near term following their emission.	0
In the case of agents that strongly absorb incoming solar radiation  and ozone) the TOA forcing provides little indication of the change in solar radiation reaching the surface which can force local changes in evaporation and alter regional and general circulation patterns . Hence the forcing at the surface, or the atmospheric heating, defined as the difference between surface and tropopause/TOA forcing, might also be useful metrics. Global mean precipitation changes can be related separately to ERF within the atmosphere and to a slower response to global mean temperature changes . Relationships between surface forcing and localized aspects of climate response have not yet been clearly quantified, however.	0
Analysis of forcing due to observed or modelled concentration changes between pre-industrial, defined here as 1750, and a chosen later year provides an indication of the importance of different forcing agents to climate change during that period. Such analyses have been a mainstay of climate assessments. This perspective has the advantage that observational data are available to accurately quantify the concentration changes for several of the largest forcing components. Atmospheric concentration changes, however, are the net result of variations in emissions of multiple compounds and any climate changes that have influenced processes such as wet removal, atmospheric chemistry or the carbon cycle. Characterizing forcing according to concentration changes thus mixes multiple root causes along with climate feedbacks. Policy decisions are better informed by analysis of forcing attributable to emissions, which the IPCC first presented in AR4. These analyses can be applied to historical emissions changes in a `backward-looking' perspective, as done for example, for major WMGHGs  and NTCFs , or to current	0
or projected future emissions in a `forward-looking' view . Emissions estimates through time typically come from the scientific community, often making use of national reporting for recent decades. With the greater use of emission-driven models, for example, in CMIP5, it is becoming more natural to estimate ERF resulting from emissions of a particular species rather than concentration-based forcing. Such calculations typically necessitate model simulations with chemical transport models or chemistry-climate models, however, and require careful consideration of which processes are included, especially when comparing results to concentration-based forcings. In particular, simulation of concentration responses to emissions changes requires incorporating models of the carbon cycle and atmospheric chemistry . The requisite expansion of the modelling realm for emissions-based forcing or emission metrics should in principle be consistent for all drivers. For example, as the response to aerosol or ozone precursor emissions includes atmospheric chemistry, the response to CO2 emissions should as well. In addition, if the CO2 concentration responses to CO2 emissions include the impact of CO2-induced climate changes on carbon uptake, then the effect of climate changes caused by any other emission on carbon uptake should also be included. Similarly, if the effects of atmospheric CO2 concentration change on carbon uptake are included, the effects of other atmospheric composition or deposition changes on carbon uptake should be included as well . Comparable issues are present for other forcing agents. In practice, the modelling realm used in studies of forcing attributable to emissions has not always been consistent. Furthermore, climate feedbacks have sometimes been included in the calculation of forcing due to ozone or aerosol changes, as when concentrations from a historical transient climate simulation are imposed for an ERF calculation. In this chapter, we endeavour to clarify which processes	0
have been included in the various estimates of forcing attributed to emissions . RF or ERF estimates based on either historical emissions or concentrations provide valuable insight into the relative and absolute contribution of various drivers to historical climate change. Scenarios of changing future emissions and land use are also developed based on various assumptions about socioeconomic trends and societal choices. The forcing resulting from such scenarios is used to understand the drivers of potential future climate changes . As with historical forcings, the actual impact on climate depends on both the temporal and spatial structure of the forcings and the rate of response of various portions of the climate system.	0
Most radiatively active compounds in the Earth's atmosphere are chemically active, meaning that atmospheric chemistry plays a large role in determining their burden and residence time. In the atmosphere, a gaseous chemically active compound can be affected by  interaction with other species  in its immediate vicinity and  interaction with solar radiation . Physical processes  act on some chemical compounds  to further define their residence time in the atmosphere. Atmospheric chemistry is characterized by many interactions and patterns of temporal or spatial variability, leading to significant nonlinearities  and a wide range of time scales of importance . 669	0
Because the distribution of NTCFs cannot be estimated from observations alone, coupled chemistry-climate simulations are required to define their evolution and associated RF. While several CMIP5 modeling groups performed simulations with interactive chemistry , many models used as input pre-computed distributions of radiatively active gases and/ or aerosols. To assess the distributions of chemical species and their respective RF, many research groups participated in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project . The ACCMIP simulations  were defined to provide information on the long-term changes in atmospheric composition with a few, well-defined atmospheric simulations. Because of the nature of the simulations , only a limited number of chemistry-transport models  participated in the ACCMIP project, which instead drew primarily from the same General Circulation Models  as CMIP5 , with extensive model evaluation against observations . In all CMIP5/ACCMIP chemistry simulations, anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions are specified. More specifically, a single set of historical anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions  and one set of emissions for each of the RCPs  was defined . This was designed to increase the comparability of simulations. However, these uniform emission specifications mask the existing uncertainty , so that there is in fact a considerable range in the estimates and time evolution of recent anthropogenic emissions . Historical reconstructions of biomass burning  also exhibit quite large uncertainties . In addition, the RCP biomass burning projections do not include the feedback between climate change and fires discussed in Bowman et al. , Pechony and Shindell  and Thonicke et al. . Finally, the RCP anthropogenic precursor emissions of NTCFs tend to span a smaller range than available from existing scenarios . The ACCMIP simulations therefore provide an estimate of the uncertainty due to range of representation of physical and chemical processes in models, but do not incorporate uncertainty in emissions.	0
8.2.3.1 Tropospheric Ozone The RF from tropospheric ozone is strongly height- and latitude-dependent through coupling of ozone change with temperature, water vapour and clouds . Consequently, it is necessary to accurately estimate the change in the ozone spatio-temporal structure using global models and observations. It is also well established that surface ozone detrimentally affects plant productivity , albeit estimating this impact on climate, although possibly significant, is still limited to a few studies . Tropospheric ozone is a by-product of the oxidation of carbon monoxide , CH4, and non-CH4 hydrocarbons in the presence of nitrogen oxides . As emissions of these precursors have increased , tropospheric ozone has increased since pre-industrial times  and over the last decades , but with important regional variations . Ozone production is usually limited by the supply of HOx  and NOX  . Ozone's major chemical loss pathways in the troposphere are through  photolysis , followed by reaction with water vapour) and  reaction with HO2 . The former pathway leads to couplings between stratospheric ozone  and climate change . Observed surface ozone abundances typically range from less than 10 ppb over the tropical Pacific Ocean to more than 100 ppb downwind of highly emitting regions. The lifetime of ozone in the troposphere varies strongly with season and location: it may be as little as a few days in the tropical boundary layer, or as much as 1 year in the upper troposphere. Two recent studies give similar global mean lifetime of ozone: 22.3  2 days  and 23.4  2.2 days . For present  conditions, the various components of the budget of global mean tropospheric ozone are estimated from the ACCMIP simulations and other model simulations since AR4 . In particular, most recent models define a globally and annually averaged tropospheric ozone burden of . Differences in the definition of the tropopause lead to inter-model variations of approximately 10% . This multi-model mean estimate of global annual tropospheric ozone burden has not significantly changed since the Stevenson et al.  estimates , and is consistent with the most recent satellite-based Ozone Monitoring Instrument-Microwave Limb Sounder  and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer  climatologies. Estimates of the ozone chemical sources and sinks  are less robust, with a net chemical production  of 618  275 Tg yr-1 , larger than the Atmospheric Composition Change: a European Network  results . Estimates of ozone deposition  are slightly increased	0

RCP values are from van Vuuren et al. . Emissions estimates from Special Report on Emission Scenarios  are discussed in Annex II; note that black carbon and organic carbon estimates were not part of the SRES and are shown here only for completeness. The Maximum Feasible Reduction  and Current Legislation  are discussed in Cofala et al. ; as biomass burning emissions are not included in that publication, a fixed amount, equivalent to the value in 2000 from the RCP estimates, is added .

indicate 10 to 20% negative bias at 250 hPa in the SH tropical region, and a slight underestimate in NH tropical region. Comparison with satellite-based estimates of tropospheric ozone column  indicates an annual mean bias of -4.3  29 Tg  for the ACCMIP simulations . Overall, our ability to simulate tropospheric ozone burden for present  has not substantially changed since AR4. Evaluation  of simulated trends  in surface ozone against observations at remote surface sites  indicates an underestimation, especially in the NH . Although this limits the ability to represent recent ozone changes, it is unclear how this translates into an uncertainty on changes since pre-industrial times. 671	0
In most studies `pre-industrial' does not identify a specific year but is usually assumed to correspond to 1850s levels; no observational information on ozone is available for that time period. Using the Lamarque et al.  emissions, the ACCMIP models  are unable to reproduce the low levels of ozone observed at Montsouris 1876-1886 . The other early ozone measurements using the Schonbein paper are controversial  and assessed to be of qualitative use only. The main uncertainty in estimating the pre-industrial to present-day change in ozone therefore remains the lack of constraint on emission trends because of the very incomplete knowledge of pre-industrial ozone concentrations, of which no new information is available. The uncertainty on pre-industrial conditions is not confined to ozone but applies to aerosols as well , although ice and lake core records provide some constraint on pre-industrial aerosol concentrations. The ACCMIP results provide an estimated tropospheric ozone increase  from 1850 to 2000 of 98  17 Tg , similar to AR4 estimates. Skeie et al.  found an additional 5% increase in the anthropogenic contribution to the ozone burden between 2000 and 2010, which translates into an approximately 1.5% increase in tropospheric ozone burden. A best estimate of the change in ozone since 1850 is assessed at 100  25 Tg . Attribution simulations 672	0
8.2.3.2 Stratospheric Ozone and Water Vapour Stratospheric ozone has experienced significant depletion since the 1960s due to bromine and chlorine-containing compounds , leading to an estimated global decrease of stratospheric ozone of 5% between the 1970s and the mid-1990s, the decrease being largest over Antarctica . Most of the ozone loss is associated with the long-lived bromine and chlorine-containing compounds  released by human activities, in addition to N2O. This is in addition to a background level of natural emissions of short-lived halogens from oceanic and volcanic sources. With the advent of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, emissions of chlorofluorocarbons  and replacements have strongly declined , and signs of ozone stabilization and even possibly recovery have already occurred . A further consequence is that N2O emissions  likely dominate all other emissions in terms of ozone-depleting	0
potential . Chemistry-climate models with resolved stratospheric chemistry and dynamics recently predicted an estimated global mean total ozone column recovery to 1980 levels to occur in 2032  under the A1B scenario . Increases in the stratospheric burden and acceleration of the stratospheric circulation leads to an increase in the stratosphere-troposphere flux of ozone . This is also seen in recent RCP8.5 simulations, with the impact of increasing tropospheric burden . However, observationally based estimates of recent trends in age of air  do not appear to be consistent with the acceleration of the stratospheric circulation found in model simulations, possibly owing to inherent difficulties with extracting trends from SF6 observations . Oxidation of CH4 in the stratosphere  is a significant source of water vapour and hence the long-term increase in CH4 leads to an anthropogenic forcing  in the stratosphere. Stratospheric water vapour abundance increased by an average of 1.0  0.2  ppm during 1980-2010, with CH4 oxidation explaining approximately 25% of this increase . Other factors contributing to the long-term change in water vapour include changes in tropical tropopause temperatures .	0
other main source of OH is through secondary reactions , although some of those reactions are still poorly understood . A recent estimate of the CH4 tropospheric chemical lifetime with respect to OH constrained by methyl chloroform surface observations is 11.2  1.3 years . In addition, bacterial uptake in soils provides an additional small, less constrained loss ; estimated lifetime = 120  24 years , with another small loss in the stratosphere ; estimated lifetime = 150  50 years . Halogen chemistry in the troposphere also contributes to some tropospheric CH4 loss , estimated lifetime = 200  100 years . The ACCMIP estimate for present CH4 lifetime with respect to tropospheric OH varies quite widely ), slightly shorter than the 10.2  1.7 years in , but much shorter than the methyl chloroform-based estimate of 11.2  1.3 years . A partial explanation for the range in CH4 lifetime changes can be found in the degree of representation of chemistry in chemistry-climate models. Indeed, Archibald et al.  showed that the response of OH to increasing nitrogen oxides strongly depends on the treatment of hydrocarbon chemistry in a model. The impact on CH4 distribution in the ACCMIP simulations is, however, rather limited because most models prescribed CH4 as a time-varying lower-boundary mixing ratio .	0
8.2.3.3 Methane The surface mixing ratio of CH4 has increased by 150% since pre-industrial times , with some projections indicating a further doubling by 2100 . Bottom-up estimates of present CH4 emissions range from 542 to 852 TgCH4 yr-1 , while a recent top-down estimate with uncertainty analysis is 554  56 TgCH4 yr-1 . All quoted uncertainties in Section 8.2.3.3 are defined as 1-. The main sink of CH4 is through its reaction with the hydroxyl radical  in the troposphere . A primary source of tropospheric OH is initiated by the photodissociation of ozone, followed by reaction with water vapour  . The	0
The chemical coupling between OH and CH4 leads to a significant amplification of an emission impact; that is, increasing CH4 emissions decreases tropospheric OH which in turn increases the CH4 lifetime and therefore its burden. The OH-lifetime sensitivity for CH4, s_OH = -ln/ln, was estimated in Chapter 4 of TAR to be 0.32, implying a 0.32% decrease in tropospheric mean OH  for a 1% increase in CH4. The Fiore et al.  multi-model  study provides a slightly smaller value . Holmes et al.  gives a range 0.31  0.04 by combining Fiore et al. , Holmes et al.  and three new model results . Only two ACCMIP models reported values . The projections of future CH4 in Chapter 11 use the Holmes et al.  range and uncertainty, which at the 2- level covers all but one model result. The feedback factor f, the ratio of the	0
Nitrous oxide  in 2011 has a surface concentration 19% above its 1750 level . Increases in N2O lead to depletion of mid- to upper-stratospheric ozone and increase in mid-latitude lower stratospheric ozone . This impacts tropospheric chemistry through increase in stratosphere-troposphere exchange of ozone and odd nitrogen species and increase in tropospheric photolysis rates and OH formation . Anthropogenic emissions represent around 30 to 45% of the present-day global total, and are mostly from agricultural and soil sources  and fossil-fuel activities. Natural emissions come mostly from microbial activity in the soil. The main sink for N2O is through photolysis and oxidation reactions in the stratosphere, leading to an estimated lifetime of 131  10 years , slightly larger than previous estimates . The addition of N2O to the atmosphere changes its own lifetime through feedbacks that couple N2O to stratospheric NOy and ozone depletion , so that the lifetime of a perturbation is less than that of the total burden, 121  10 years  and is used in calculations of metrics .	0
8.2.3.5 Halogenated Species Halogenated species can be powerful greenhouse gases . Those containing chlorine and bromine also deplete stratospheric ozone and are referred to as ozone-depleting substances . Most of those compounds do not have natural emissions and, because of the implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, total emissions of ODSs have sharply decreased since the 1990s . For CFCs, perfluorocarbons  and SF6 the main loss is through photolysis in the stratosphere. The CFC substitutes  and hydrofluorocarbons ) are destroyed by OH oxidation in the troposphere. Their global concentration has steadily risen over the recent past .	0
Human activity has caused a variety of changes in different forcing agents in the atmosphere or land surface. A large number of GHGs have had a substantial increase over the Industrial Era and some of these gases are entirely of anthropogenic origin. Atmospheric aerosols have diverse and complex influences on the climate. Human activity has modified the land cover and changed the surface albedo. Some of the gases and aerosols are directly emitted to the atmosphere whereas others are secondary products from chemical reactions of emitted species. The lifetimes of these different forcing agents vary substantially. This section discusses all known anthropogenic forcing agents of non-negligible importance and their quantification in terms of RF or ERF based on changes in abundance over the 1750-2011 period. In this section we determine the RFs for WMGHGs and heterogeneously distributed species in fundamentally different ways. As described in Box 8.2, the concentrations of WMGHGs can be determined from observations at a few surface sites. For the pre-industrial concentrations these are typically from trapped air in polar ice or firn . Thus the RFs from WMGHGs are determined entirely from observations . In contrast, we do not have sufficient pre-industrial or present-day observations of heterogeneously distributed forcing agents  to be able to characterize their RF; therefore we instead have to rely on chemistry-climate models .	0
the difference among different editions of HITRAN databases for diverse uses . Model calculations have shown that modifications of the spectroscopic characteristics tend to have a modest effect on the determination of RF estimates of order 2 to 3% of the calculated RF attributed to the combined doubling of CO2, N2O and CH4. These results showed that even the largest overall RF induced by differences among the HITRAN databases is considerably smaller than the range reported for the modelled RF estimates; thus the line parameter updates to the HITRAN database are not a significant source for discrepancies in the RF calculations appearing in the IPCC reports. However, the more recent HITRAN data set is still recommended, as the HITRAN process offers internal verification and tends to progress closer to the best laboratory measurements. It is found that the differences among the water vapour continuum absorption formulations tend to be comparable to the differences among the various HITRAN databases ; but use of the older Robert continuum formula produces significantly larger flux differences, thus, replacement of the older continuum is warranted  and there are still numerous unresolved issues left in the continuum expression, especially related to shortwave radiative transfer . Differences in absorption data from various HITRAN versions are very likely a small contributor to the uncertainty in RF of GHGs. Line-by-line  models using the HITRAN data set as an input are the benchmark of radiative transfer models for GHGs. Some researchers compared different LBL models  and line-wing cutoff, line-shape function and gas continuum absorption treatment effects on LBL calculations . The agreement between LBL codes has been investigated in many studies and found to generally be within a few percent  and to compare well to observed radiative fluxes under controlled situations . Forster et al.  evaluated global mean radiatively important properties of chemistry climate models  and found that the combined WMGHG global annual mean instantaneous RF at the tropopause is within 30% of LBL models for all CCM radiation codes tested. The accuracies of the LW RF due to CO2 and tropospheric ozone increase are generally very good and within 10% for most of the participation models, but problems remained in simulating RF for stratospheric water vapour and ozone changes with errors between 3% and 200% compared to LBL models. Whereas the differences in the results from CCM radiation codes were large, the agreement among the LW LBL codes was within 5%, except for stratospheric water vapour changes. Most intercomparison studies of the RF of GHGs are for clear-sky and aerosol-free conditions; the introduction of clouds would greatly complicate the targets of research and are usually omitted in the intercomparison exercises of GCM radiation codes and LBL codes . It is shown that clouds can reduce the magnitude of RF due to GHGs by about 25% , but the influence of clouds on the diversity in RF is found to be within 5% in four detailed radiative transfer schemes with realistic cloud distributions . Estimates of GHG RF are based on the LBL codes or the r adiative 676	0
AR4 assessed the RF from 1750 to 2005 of the WMGHGs to be 2.63 W m-2. The four most important gases were CO2, CH4, dichlorodifluoromethane  and N2O in that order. Halocarbons, comprising CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs and SF6, contributed 0.337 W m-2 to the total. Uncertainties  were assessed to be approximately 10% for the WMGHGs. The major changes to the science since AR4 are the updating of the atmospheric concentrations, the inclusion of new species  and discussion of ERF for CO2. Since AR4 N2O has overtaken CFC-12 as the third largest contributor to RF. The total WMGHG RF is now 2.83  W m-2. The RFs in this section are derived from the observed differences in concentrations of the WMGHGs between 1750 and 2011. The concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O vary throughout the pre-industrial era, mostly due to varying climate, with a possible small contribution from anthropogenic emissions . These variations do not contribute to uncertainty in the RF as strictly defined here, but do affect the RF attribution to anthropogenic emissions. On centennial time scales, variations in late Holocene concentrations of CO2 are around 10 ppm , much larger than the uncertainty in the 1750 concentration. This would equate to a variation in the RF of 10%. For CH4 and N2O the centennial variations are comparable to the uncertainties in the 1750 concentrations and so do not significantly affect the estimate of the 1750 value used in calculating RF.	0
8.3.2.1 Carbon Dioxide The tropospheric mixing ratio of CO2 has increased globally from 278  ppm in 1750 to 390.5  ppm in 2011 . Here we assess the RF due to changes in atmospheric concentration rather than attributing it to anthropogenic emissions. Section 6.3.2.6 describes how only a fraction of the historical CO2 emissions have remained in the atmosphere. The impact of land use change on CO2 from 1850 to 2000 was assessed in AR4 to be 12 to 35 ppm . Using the formula from Table 3 of Myhre et al. , and see Supplementary Material Table 8.SM.1, the CO2 RF  from 1750 to 2011 is 1.82  W m-2. The uncertainty is dominated by the radiative transfer modelling which is assessed to be 10% . The uncertainty in the knowledge of 1750 concentrations contributes only 2%  Table 8.2 shows the concentrations and RF in AR4  and 2011 for the most important WMGHGs. Figure 8.6 shows the time evolution of RF and its rate of change. Since AR4, the RF of CO2 has increased by 0.16 W m-2 and continues the rate noted in AR4 of almost 0.3 W m-2 per decade. As shown in Figure 8.6 the rate of increase in the RF	0
As described in Section 8.1.1.3, CO2 can also affect climate through physical effects on lapse rates and clouds, leading to an ERF that will be different from the RF. Analysis of CMIP5 models  found a large negative contribution to the ERF  from the increase in land surface temperatures which was compensated for by positive contributions from the combined effects on water vapour, lapse rate, albedo and clouds. It is therefore not possible to conclude with the current information whether the ERF for CO2 is higher or lower than the RF. Therefore we assess the ratio ERF/RF to be 1.0 and assess our uncertainty in the CO2 ERF to be . We have medium confidence in this based on our understanding that the physical processes responsible for the differences between ERF and RF are small enough to be covered within the 20% uncertainty. There are additional effects mediated through plant physiology, reducing the conductance of the plant stomata and hence the transpiration of water. Andrews et al.  find a physiological enhancement of the adjusted forcing by 3.5% due mainly to reductions in low cloud. This is smaller than a study with an earlier model by Doutriaux-Boucher et al.  which found a 10% effect. Longer-term impacts of CO2 on vegetation distributions also affect climate  but because of the longer time scale we choose to class these as feedbacks rather than rapid adjustments.	0
8.3.2.2 Methane Globally averaged surface CH4 concentrations have risen from 722  25 ppb in 1750 to 1803  2 ppb by 2011 . Over that time scale the rise has been due predominantly to changes in anthropogenic-related CH4. Anthropogenic emissions of other compounds have also affected CH4 concentrations by changing its removal rate . Using the formula from Myhre et al.   the RF for CH4 from 1750 to 2011 is 0.48  0.05 W m-2, with an uncertainty dominated by the radiative transfer calculation. This increase of 0.01 W m-2 since AR4 is due to the 29 ppb increase in the CH4 mixing ratio. This is much larger than the 11 ppb increase between TAR and AR4, and has been driven by increases in net natural and anthropogenic emissions, but the relative contributions are not well quantified. Recent trends in CH4 and their causes are discussed in Sections 2.2.1.1.2 and 6.3.3.1. CH4 concentrations do vary with latitude and decrease above the tropopause; however, this variation contributes only 2% to the uncertainty in RF . In this section only the direct forcing from changing CH4 concentrations is addressed. CH4 emissions can also have indirect effects on climate through impacts on CO2, stratospheric water vapour, ozone, sulphate aerosol and lifetimes of HFCs and HCFCs . Some of these are discussed further in Sections 8.3.3, 8.5.1 and 8.7.2.	0
of WMGHG RF is shown in Figure 8.6 . Between 1970 and 1990 halocarbons made a significant contribution to the rate of change of RF. The rate of change in the total WMGHG RF was higher in 1970 to 1990 with high confidence compared to the present owing to higher contribution from non-CO2 gases especially the halocarbons. Since the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, the rate of change of RF from halocarbons and related compounds has been much less, but still just positive  as the growth of HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs and other halogens  RFs  more than compensates	0

Concentration data are averages of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  and Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment  observations where available. CO2 concentrations are the average of NOAA and SIO. See Table 2.1 for more details of the data sources. The data for 2005  are also shown. Some of the concentrations vary slightly from those reported in AR4 owing to averaging different data sources. Radiative efficiencies for the minor gases are given in Table 8.A.1. Uncertainties in the RF for all gases are dominated by the uncertainties in the radiative efficiencies. We assume the uncertainties in the radiative efficiencies to be perfectly correlated between the gases, and the uncertainties in the present day and 1750 concentrations to be uncorrelated.	0
Unlike for the WMGHGs, the estimate of the tropospheric and stratospheric ozone concentration changes are almost entirely model based for the full pre-industrial to present-day interval . AR4 assessed the RF  from tropospheric ozone to be 0.35 W m-2 from multi-model studies with a high 95th percentile of 0.65 W m-2 to allow for the possibility of model overestimates of the pre-industrial tropospheric ozone levels. The stratospheric ozone RF was assessed from observational trends from 1979 to 1998 to be -0.05  0.1 W m-2, with the 90% confidence range increased to reflect uncertainty in the trend prior to 1979 and since 1998. In AR4 the RF from stratospheric water vapour generated by CH4 oxidation was assessed to be +0.07  0.05 W m-2 based on Hansen et al. .	0
Since AR4, there have been a few individual studies of tropospheric or stratospheric ozone forcing , a multi-model study of stratospheric ozone RF in the 2010 WMO stratospheric ozone assessment , and the ACCMIP multi-model study of tropospheric and tropospheric + stratospheric chemistry models . There is now greater understanding of how tropospheric ozone precursors can affect stratospheric ozone, and how ODSs can affect tropospheric ozone . We assess the total ozone RF to be +0.35  W m-2. This can be split according to altitude or by emitted species . We assess these contributions to be 0.40  W m-2 for ozone in the troposphere and -0.05  0.10 W m-2 for ozone in the stratosphere based on the studies presented in Table 8.3. Alternatively, the contributions to the total ozone forcing can be attributed as 0.50  W m-2 from ozone precursors and -0.15  W m-2 from the effect of ODSs. The value attributed to ODSs is assessed to be slightly smaller in magnitude than in the two studies quoted in Table 8.3  because the models used for these had stratospheric ozone RFs with higher magnitudes than the ACCMIP mean . Differences between the ERFs and RFs for tropospheric and stratospheric ozone are likely to be small compared to the uncertainties in the RFs , so the assessed values for the ERFs are the same as those for the RFs. The influence of climate change is typically included in ozone RF estimates as those are based on modelled concentration changes, but the available literature provides insufficient evidence for the sign and magnitude of the impact and we therefore refrain from giving an estimate except to assess that it is very likely to be smaller than the overall uncertainty in the total RF. Unlike the WMGHGs, there are significant latitudinal variations in the RFs from changes in tropospheric and stratospheric ozone. The implications of inhomogeneous RFs are explored in more detail in Section 8.6. There has been one study since AR4  on the RF from water vapour formed from the stratospheric oxidation of CH4 . This is consistent with the AR4 value and so has not led to any change in the recommended value of 0.07  W m-2 since AR4.	0
8.3.3.1 Tropospheric Ozone Ozone is formed in the troposphere by photochemical reactions of natural and anthropogenic precursor species . Changes in ozone above the tropopause due to emissions of stratospheric ODSs can also affect ozone in the troposphere either by transport across the tropopause or modification of photolysis rates. Changes in climate have also affected tropospheric ozone concentrations  through changes in chemistry, natural emissions and transport from the stratosphere . The most recent estimates of tropospheric ozone RF come from multi-model studies under ACCMIP . The model ensemble reported only 1850-2000 RFs  so the single-model results from Skeie et 679	0
non-methane volatile organic compounds . These results were calculated by reducing the precursor emissions individually from 2000 to pre-industrial levels. The results were scaled by the total ozone RFs attributed to ozone precursors  to give the contributions to the full 1750-2010 RF. Because of the nonlinearity of the chemistry an alternative method of starting from pre-industrial conditions and increasing precursor emissions singly may give a different result. Note that as well as inducing an ozone RF, these ozone precursor species can also strongly affect the concentrations of CH4 and aerosols, adding extra terms  to their total indirect forcings. The contributions to the 1750-2010 CH4 RF are again based on Stevenson et al.  and Shindell et al. . The Stevenson et al.  values are for 1850-2000 rather than 1750 to 2011 so for these we distribute the CH4 RF for 1750-1850 and 2000-2011  by scaling the CH4 and CO contributions . This gives contributions of 0.58  0.08, -0.29  0.18, 0.07  0.02 and 0.02  0.02 W m-2 for changes from historical to present day emissions of CH4 , NOX, CO and VOCs respectively . The difference between the total CH4 RF attributed to ozone precursors here  and the value calculated from CH4 concentration changes in Table 8.2  is due to nonlinearities in the CH4 chemistry because large single-step changes were used. To allow an easier comparison between the concentration-based and emission-based approaches in Section 8.5.1 the nonlinear term  is distributed between the four emitted species according to their absolute magnitude so that they total 0.48 W m-2. The scaled results still lie within the uncertainty bounds of the values quoted above. The impact of climate change over the historical period on CH4 oxidation is not accounted for in these calculations.	0
It can be useful to calculate a normalized radiative forcing  which is an RF per change in ozone column in W m-2 DU-1 or W mol-1. This is only an approximation as the NRF is sensitive to the vertical profile of the ozone change and to the latitudinal profile to a smaller extent. From Table 8.3 we assess the NRF to be 0.042  W m-2 DU-1  W mol-1) similar to the value of 0.042 W m-2 DU-1  in TAR . A small number of studies have looked at attributing the ozone changes among the anthropogenically emitted species. Sovde et al.  report a tropospheric ozone RF of 0.38 W m-2, 0.44 W m-2 from ozone precursors and -0.06 W m-2 from the impact of stratospheric ozone depletion on the troposphere. Shindell et al.  also calculate that ODSs are responsible for about -0.06 W m-2 of the tropospheric ozone RF, and ozone precursors for about 0.41 W m-2. Six of the models in Stevenson et al.  and Shindell et al.  performed experiments to attribute the ozone RF to the individual precursor emissions. An average of these seven model results leads to attributions of 0.24  0.13 W m-2 due to CH4 emissions, 0.14  0.09 W m-2 from NOX emissions, 0.07  0.03 W m-2 from CO, and 0.04  0.03W m-2 from 680	0
al.  were used to expand the timespan to 1750-2010, adding 0.04 W m-2, and 0.02 W m-2 to account for the periods 1750-1850 and 2000-2010 respectively. The best estimate of tropospheric ozone RF taking into account the ACCMIP models and the Sovde et al.  results  and Shindell et al.  models are included in ACCMIP) is 0.40  W m-2. The quantifiable uncertainties come from the inter-model spread  and the differences between radiative transfer models ; all 5 to 95% confidence interval. Additional uncertainties arise from the lack of knowledge of pre-industrial emissions and the representation of chemical and physical processes beyond those included in the current models. The tropospheric ozone RF is sensitive to the assumed `pre-industrial' levels. As described in Section 8.2.3.1, very limited late 19th and early 20th century observations of surface ozone concentrations are lower than the ACCMIP models for the same period; however, we assess that those observations are very uncertain. Skeie et al.  and Stevenson et al.  increase their uncertainty ranges to 30% for 1 standard deviation which is equivalent to  for the 5 to 95% confidence range and we adopt this for AR5. The overall confidence in the tropospheric ozone RF is assessed as high.	0
8.3.3.2 Stratospheric Ozone The decreases in stratospheric ozone due to anthropogenic emissions of ODSs have a positive RF in the shortwave  and a negative RF in the longwave. This leaves a residual forcing that is the difference of two larger terms. In the lower stratosphere the longwave effect tends to be larger, whereas in the upper stratosphere the shortwave dominates. Thus whether stratospheric ozone depletion has contributed an overall net positive or negative forcing depends on the vertical profile of the change . WMO  assessed the RF from 1979 to 2005 from observed ozone changes  and results from 16 models for the 1970s average to 2004. The observed and modelled mean ozone changes gave RF values of different signs . Negative net RFs arise from models with ozone decline in the lowermost stratosphere, particularly at or near the tropopause. The ACCMIP study also included some models with stratospheric chemistry . One model in that study stood out as having excessive ozone depletion. Removing that model leaves a stratospheric ozone RF of -0.02  W m-2. These results are in good agreement with the model studies from WMO . Forster et al.  in AR4 calculated a forcing of -0.05 W m-2 from observations over the period 1979-1998 and increased the uncertainty to 0.10 W m-2 to encompass changes between the pre-industrial period and	0
2005. The RF from stratospheric ozone due to changes in emissions of ozone precursors and ODSs is here assessed to be -0.05  taking into account all the studies listed in Table 8.3. This is in agreement with AR4, although derived from different data. The timeline of stratospheric ozone forcing is shown in Figure 8.7, making the assumption that it follows the trajectory of the changes in EESC. It reaches a minimum in the late 1990s and starts to recover after that. The net global RF from ODSs taking into account the compensating effects on ozone and their direct effects as WMGHGs is 0.18  W m-2. The patterns of RF for these two effects are different so the small net global RF comprises areas of positive and negative RF.	0
8.3.3.3 Stratospheric Water Vapour Stratospheric water vapour is dependent on the amount entering from the tropical troposphere and from direct injection by volcanic plumes  and aircraft, and the in situ chemical production from the oxidation of CH4 and hydrogen. This contrasts with tropospheric water vapour which is almost entirely controlled by the balance between evaporation and precipitation . We consider trends in the transport  to be climate feedback rather than a forcing so the anthropogenic RFs come from oxidation of CH4 and hydrogen, and emissions from stratospheric aircraft. Myhre et al.  used observations of the vertical profile of CH4 to deduce a contribution from oxidation of anthropogenic CH4 of 0.083 681	0
W m-2 which compares with the value of 0.07 W m-2 from calculations in a 2D model in Hansen et al. . Both of these values are consistent with AR4 which obtained the stratospheric water vapour forcing by scaling the CH4 direct forcing by 15%. Thus the time evolution of this forcing is also obtained by scaling the CH4 forcing by 15%. The best estimate and uncertainty range from AR4 of 0.07  W m-2 remain unchanged and the large uncertainty range is due to large differences found in the intercomparison studies of radiative transfer modelling for changes in stratospheric water vapour . RF from the current aircraft fleet through stratospheric water vapour emissions is very small. Wilcox et al.  estimate a contribution from civilian aircraft in 2005 of 0.0009  W m-2 with high confidence in the upper limit. Water vapour emissions from aircraft in the troposphere also contribute to contrails which are discussed in Section 8.3.4.5.	0
8.3.4.1 Introduction and Summary of AR4 In AR4 , RF estimates were provided for three aerosol effects. These were the RF of aerosol-radiation interaction , RF of the aerosol-cloud interaction , and the impact of BC on snow and ice surface albedo. See Chapter 7 and Figure 7.3 for an explanation of the change in terminology between AR4 and AR5. The RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction is scattering and absorption of shortwave and longwave radiation by atmospheric aerosols. Several different aerosol types from various sources are present in the atmosphere . Most of the aerosols primarily scatter solar radiation, but some components absorb solar radiation to various extents with BC as the most absorbing component. RF of aerosols in the troposphere is often calculated at the TOA because it is similar to tropopause values . A best estimate RF of -0.5  0.4 W m-2 was given in AR4 for the change in the net aerosol-radiation interaction between 1750 and 2005 and a medium to low level of scientific understanding . An increase in the hygroscopic aerosol abundance may enhance the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei . This may increase the cloud albedo and under the assumption of fixed cloud water content this effect was given a best estimate of -0.7 W m-2  in AR4 and a low LOSU. BC in the snow or ice can lead to a decrease of the surface albedo. This leads to a positive RF. In AR4 this mechanism was given a best RF estimate of 0.1  0.1 W m-2 and a low LOSU. Impacts on clouds from the ERF of aerosol-cloud interaction  and the ERF of aerosol-radiation interaction  were not strictly in accordance with the RF concept, because they involve tropospheric changes in variables other than the forcing agent at least in the available model estimates, so no best RF e stimates 682	0
8.3.4.2 Radiation Forcing of the Aerosol-Radiation Interaction by Component Based on a combination of global aerosol models and observation-based methods, the best RF estimate of the aerosol-radiation interaction in AR5 is -0.35  W m-2 . This estimate is thus smaller in magnitude than in AR4, however; with larger uncertainty range. Overall, the estimate compared to AR4 is more robust because the agreement between estimates from models and observation-based methods is much greater . The larger range arises primarily from analysis by observation-based methods . The main source of the model estimate is based on updated simulations in AeroCom , which is an intercomparison exercise of a large set of global aerosol models that includes extensive evaluation against measurements. The assessment in Chapter 7 relies to a large extent on this study for the separation in the various aerosol components, except for BC where the assessment in Chapter 7 relies in addition on Bond et al. . The RF of aerosol-radiation interaction is separated into seven components in this report; namely sulphate, BC from fossil fuel and biofuel, OA from fossil fuel and biofuel, BC and OA combined from biomass burning , nitrate, SOA and mineral dust. BC and OA from biomass burning are combined due to the joint sources, whereas treated separately for fossil fuel and biofuel because there is larger variability in the ratio of BC to OA in the fossil fuel and biofuel emissions. This approach is consistent with TAR and AR4. Table 8.4 compares the best estimates of RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction for various components in this report with values in SAR, TAR and AR4. In magnitude the sulphate and BC from use of fossil fuel and biofuel dominate. It is important to note that the BB RF is small in magnitude but consists of larger, offsetting terms in magnitude from OA and BC . Changes in the estimates of RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction of the various components have been rather modest compared to AR4, except for BC from fossil fuel and biofuel . SOA is a new component compared to AR4. Anthropogenic SOA precursors contribute only modestly to the anthropogenic change in SOA. The increase in SOA is mostly from biogenic precursors and enhanced partitioning of SOA into existing particles from anthropogenic sources and changes in the atmospheric oxidation . This change in SOA is therefore of anthropogenic origin, but natural emission of SOA precursors is important . Note that the best estimate and the uncertainty for the total is not equal to the sum of the aerosol components because the total is estimated based on a combination of methods , whereas the estimates for the components rely mostly on model estimates.	0
lake core records, and uncertainties in the historical emission of aerosols and their precursors used in the global aerosol modeling are larger than for current conditions. Emissions of carbonaceous aerosols are particularly uncertain in the 1800s due to a significant biofuel source in this period, in contrast to the SO2 emissions which were very small until the end of the 1800s. The uncertainty in the biomass burning emissions also increases backward in time. Note that, for 1850, the biomass burning emissions from Lamarque et al.  are quite different from the previous estimates, but RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction is close to zero for this component. Figure 8.8 shows an example of the time evolution of the RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction as a total and separated into six aerosol components. From 1950 to 1990 there was a strengthening of the total RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction, mainly due to a strong enhancement of the sulphate RF. After 1990 the change has been small with even a weakening of the RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction, mainly due to a stronger BC RF as a result of increased emissions in East and Southeast Asia.	0
Figure 8.8 | Time evolution of RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction and BC on snow and ice. Multi-model results for 1850, 1930, 1980 and 2000 from ACCMIP for aerosol-radiation interaction  and BC on snow and ice  are combined with higher temporal-resolution results from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies -E2 and Oslo-Chemical Transport Model 2  models  and OsloCTM2 . Uncertainty ranges  for year 2010 are shown with vertical lines. Values next to the uncertainty lines are for cases where uncertainties go beyond the scale. The total includes the RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction for six aerosol components and RF due to BC on snow and ice. All values have been scaled to the best estimates for 2011 given in Table 8.4. Note that time evolution for mineral dust is not included and the total RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction is estimated based on simulations of the six other aerosol components.	0
The RF by aerosol effects on cloud albedo was previously referred to as the Twomey or cloud albedo effect . Although this RF can be calculated, no estimate of this forcing is given because it has heuristic value only and does not simply translate to the ERF due to aerosol-cloud interaction. The total aerosol ERF, namely ERF due to aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions  provided in Chapter 7 is estimated with a 5 to 95% uncertainty between -1.9 and -0.1 W m-2 with a best estimate value of -0.9 W m-2 . The likely range of this forcing is between -1.5 and -0.4 W m-2. The estimate of ERF due to aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interaction is lower  than the corresponding AR4 RF estimate of -1.2 W m-2 because the latter was based mainly on GCM studies that did not take secondary processes  into account. This new best estimate of ERF due to aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interaction is also consistent with the studies allowing cloud-scale processes and related responses and with the lower estimates of this forcing inferred from satellite observations.	0
Air quality is nominally a measure of airborne surface pollutants, such as ozone, carbon monoxide, NOx and aerosols . Exposure to such pollutants exacerbates respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, harms plants and damages buildings. For these reasons, most major urban centres try to control discharges of airborne pollutants. Unlike carbon dioxide  and other well-mixed greenhouse gases, tropospheric ozone and aerosols may last in the atmosphere only for a few days to a few weeks, though indirect couplings within the Earth system can prolong their impact. These pollutants are usually most potent near their area of emission or formation, where they can force local or regional perturbations to climate, even if their globally averaged effect is small. Air pollutants affect climate differently according to their physical and chemical characteristics. Pollution-generated greenhouse gases will impact climate primarily through shortwave and longwave radiation, while aerosols can in addition affect climate through cloud-aerosol interactions. Controls on anthropogenic emissions of methane  to lower surface ozone have been identified as `win-win' situations. Consequences of controlling other ozone precursors are not always as clear. NOx emission controls, for instance, might be expected to have a cooling effect as they reduce tropospheric ozone, but their impact on CH4 lifetime and aerosol formation is more likely instead to cause overall warming. Satellite observations have identified increasing atmospheric concentrations of SO2  from coal-burning power plants over eastern Asia during the last few decades. The most recent power plants use scrubbers to reduce such emissions . This improves air quality, but also reduces the cooling effect of sulphate aerosols and therefore exacerbates warming. Aerosol cooling occurs through aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions and is estimated at -0.9 W m-2  since pre-industrial, having grown especially during the second half of the 20th century when anthropogenic emissions rose sharply.  Ozone pollution controls	1
Air quality controls might also target a specific anthropogenic activity sector, such as transportation or energy production. In that case, co-emitted species within the targeted sector lead to a complex mix of chemistry and climate perturbations. For example, smoke from biofuel combustion contains a mixture of both absorbing and scattering particles as well as ozone precursors, for which the combined climate impact can be difficult to ascertain. Thus, surface air quality controls will have some consequences on climate. Some couplings between the targeted emissions and climate are still poorly understood or identified, including the effects of air pollutants on precipitation patterns, making it difficult to fully quantify these consequences. There is an important twist, too, in the potential effect of climate change on air quality. In particular, an observed correlation between surface ozone and temperature in polluted regions indicates that higher temperatures from climate change alone could worsen summertime pollution, suggesting a `climate penalty'. This penalty implies stricter surface ozone controls will be required to achieve a specific target. In addition, projected changes in the frequency and duration of stagnation events could impact air quality conditions. These features will be regionally variable and difficult to assess, but better understanding, quantification and modelling of these processes will clarify the overall interaction between air pollutants and climate.	0
One reason an expert judgment estimate of ERF due to aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interaction is provided rather than ERF due to aerosol-cloud interaction specifically is that the individual contributions are very difficult to disentangle. These contributions are the response of processes that are the outputs from a system that is constantly readjusting to multiple nonlinear forcings. Assumptions of independence and linearity are required to deduce ERF due to aerosol-radiation interaction and ERF due to aerosol-cloud interaction . Under these assumptions, ERF due to aerosol-cloud interaction is deduced as the difference between ERF due to aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interaction and ERF due to aerosol-radiation interaction alone. This yields an ERF due to aerosol-cloud interaction estimate of -0.45 W m-2 which is much smaller in magnitude than the -1.4 W m-2 median forcing value of the models summarized in Figure 7.19 and is also smaller in magnitude than the AR4 estimates of -0.7 W m-2 for RF due to aerosol-cloud interaction.	0
8.3.4.4 Black Carbon Deposition in Snow and Ice Because absorption by ice is very weak at visible and ultraviolet  wavelengths, BC in snow makes the snow darker and increases absorption. This is not enough darkening to be seen by eye, but it is enough to be important for climate . Several studies since AR4 have re-examined this issue and find that the RF may be weaker than the estimates of Hansen and Nazarenko  in AR4 . The anthropogenic BC on snow/ ice is assessed to have a positive global and annual mean RF of +0.04 W m-2, with a 0.02-0.09 W m-2 5 to 95% uncertainty range (see fur-	0
ther description in Section 7.5.2.3). This RF has a two to four times larger global mean surface temperature change per unit forcing than a change in CO2. In Figure 8.8, the time evolution of global mean RF due to BC on snow and ice is shown based on multi-model simulations in ACCMIP  for 1850, 1930, 1980 and 2000. The results show a maximum in the RF in 1980 with a small increase since 1850 and a 20% lower RF in 2000 compared to 1980. Those results are supported by observations. The BC concentration in the Arctic atmosphere is observed to be declining since 1990, at least in the Western Hemisphere portion , which should lead to less deposition of BC on the snow surface. Surveys across Arctic during 1998 and 2005 to 2009 showed that the BC content of Arctic snow appears to be lower than in 1984  and found BC concentrations in Canada, Alaska and the Arctic Ocean , about a factor of 2 lower than measured in the 1980s . Large-area field campaigns  found that the BC content of snow in northeast China is comparable to values found in Europe. The steep drop off in BC content of snow with latitude in northeast China may indicate that there is not much BC in the Arctic coming from China . The change in the spatial pattern of emission of BC is a main cause for the difference in the temporal development of RF due to BC on snow and ice compared to the BC from RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction over the last decades.	0
8.3.5.1 Introduction Anthropogenic land cover change has a direct impact on the Earth radiation budget through a change in the surface albedo. It also impacts the climate through modifications in the surface roughness, latent heat flux and river runoff. In addition, human activity may change the water cycle through irrigation and power plant cooling, and also generate direct input of heat to the atmosphere by consuming energy. Land use change, and in particular deforestation, also has significant impacts on WMGHG concentration, which are discussed in Section 6.3.2.2. Potential geo-engineering techniques that aim at increasing the surface albedo are discussed in Section 7.7.2.3. AR4 referenced a large number of RF estimates resulting from a change in land cover albedo. It discussed the uncertainties due to the reconstruction of historical vegetation, the characterization of present-day vegetation and the surface radiation processes. On this basis, AR4 gave a best estimate of RF relative to 1750 due to land use related surface albedo at -0.2  0.2 W m-2 with a level of scientific understanding at medium-low.	0
8.3.5.2 Land Cover Changes Hurtt et al.  estimates that 42 to 68% of the global land surface was impacted by land use activities  during the 1700-2000 period. Until the mid-20th century most land use change took place over the temperate regions of the NH. Since then, reforestation is observed in Western Europe, North America and China as a result of land abandonment and afforestation efforts, while deforestation is concentrated in the tropics. After a rapid increase of the rate of deforestation during the 1980s and 1990s, satellite data indicate a slowdown in the past decade . Since AR4, Pongratz et al.  and Kaplan et al.  extended existing reconstructions on land use back in time to the past millennium, accounting for the progress of agriculture technique and historical events such as the black death or war invasions. As agriculture was already widespread over Europe and South Asia by 1750, the RF, which is defined with respect to this date, is weaker than the radiative flux change from the state of natural vegetation cover . Deforestation in Europe and Asia during the last millennium led to a significant regional negative forcing. Betts et al.  and Goosse et al.  argue that it probably contributed to the `Little Ice Age', together with natural solar and volcanic activity components, before the increase in GHG concentration led to temperatures similar to those 686	0
8.3.5.3 Surface Albedo and Radiative Forcing Surface albedo is the ratio between reflected and incident solar flux at the surface. It varies with the surface cover. Most forests are darker  than grasses and croplands, which are darker than barren land and desert. As a consequence, deforestation tends to increase the Earth albedo  while cultivation of some bright surfaces may have the opposite effect. Deforestation also leads to a large increase in surface albedo in case of snow cover as low vegetation accumulates continuous snow cover more readily in early winter allowing it to persist longer in spring. This causes average winter albedo in deforested areas to be generally much higher than that of a tree-covered landscape . The pre-industrial impact of the Earth albedo increase due to land use change, including the reduced snow masking by tall vegetation, is estimated to be on the order of -0.05 W m-2 . Since then, the increase in world population and agriculture development led to additional forcing. Based on reconstruction of land use since the beginning of the Industrial Era, Betts et al.  and Pongratz et al.  computed spatially and temporally distributed estimates of the land use RF. They estimate that the shortwave flux change induced by the albedo variation, from fully natural vegetation state to 1992, is on the order of -0.2 W m-2 . The RF, defined with respect to 1750, is in the range -0.17 to -0.18 W m-2. A slightly stronger value  was found by Davin et al.  for the period 1860-1992. In recent years, the availability of global scale MODIS data  has improved surface albedo estimates . These data have been used by Myhre et al  and Kvalevag et al. . They argue that the observed albedo difference between natural vegetation and croplands is less than usually assumed in climate simulations, so that the RF due to land use change is weaker than in estimates that do not use the satellite data. On the other hand, Nair et al.  show observational evidence of an underestimate of the surface albedo change in land use analysis in southwest Australia. Overall, there is still a significant range of RF estimates for the albedo component of land use forcing. This is mostly due to the range of albedo change as a result of land use change, as shown in an inter-comparison of seven atmosphere-land models . Deforestation has a direct impact on the atmospheric CO2 concentration and therefore contributes to the WMGHG RF as quantified in Section 8.3.2. Conversely, afforestation is a climate mitigation strategy to limit the CO2 concentration increase. Several authors have compared the radiative impact of deforestation/afforestation that results from the albedo change with the greenhouse effect of CO2 released/ sequestered. Pongratz et al.  shows that the historic land use change has had a warming impact  at the global scale and over most regions with the exception of Europe and India. Bala et al.  results show latitudinal contrast where the greenhouse effect dominates for low-latitude deforestation while	0
pears within one to a few years . Myhre et al.  estimates a global albedo-related radiative effect due to African fires of 0.015 W m-2. Over semi-arid areas, the development of agriculture favours the generation of dust. Mulitza et al.  demonstrates a very large increase of dust emission and deposition in the Sahel concomitant with the development of agriculture in this area. This, together with the analysis of dust sources , suggests that a significant fraction of the dust that is transported over the Atlantic has an anthropogenic origin and impacts the Earth albedo. There is no full estimate of the resulting RF, however. The dust RF estimate in Section 8.3.4.2 includes both land use contributions and change in wind-driven emissions. Both dust and biomass burning aerosol may impact the Earth surface albedo as these particles can be deposed on snow, which has a large impact on its absorption, in particular for soot. This is discussed in Section 8.3.4.4.	0
8.3.5.5 Impacts of Surface Change on Climate Davin et al.  argues that the climate sensitivity to land use forcing is lower than that for other forcings, due to its spatial distribution but also the role of non-radiative processes. Indeed, in addition to the impact on the surface albedo, land use change also modifies the evaporation and surface roughness, with counterbalancing consequences on the lower atmosphere temperature. There is increasing evidence that the impact of land use on evapotranspiration--a non-RF on climate--is comparable to, but of opposite sign than, the albedo effect, so that RF is not as useful a metric as it is for gases and aerosols. For instance, Findell et al.  climate simulations show a negligible impact of land use change on the global mean temperature, although there are some significant regional changes. Numerical climate experiments demonstrate that the impact of land use on climate is much more complex than just the RF. This is due in part to the very heterogeneous nature of land use change , but mostly due to the impact on the hydrological cycle through evapotranspiration, root depth and cloudiness . As a consequence, the forcing on climate is not purely radiative and the net impact on the surface temperature may be either positive or negative depending on the latitude . Davin and de Noblet-Ducoudre  analyses the impact on climate of large-scale deforestation; the albedo cooling effect dominates for high latitude whereas reduced evapotranspiration dominates in the tropics. This latitudinal trend is confirmed by observations of the temperature difference between open land and nearby forested land . Irrigated areas have continuously increased during the 20th century although a slowdown has been observed in recent decades (Bonfils 687	0
8.3.5.6 Conclusions There is still a rather wide range of estimates of the albedo change due to anthropogenic land use change, and its RF. Although most published studies provide an estimate close to -0.2 W m-2, there is convincing evidence that it may be somewhat weaker as the albedo difference between natural and anthropogenic land cover may have been overestimated. In addition, non-radiative impact of land use have a similar magnitude, and may be of opposite sign, as the albedo effect . A comparison of the impact of land use change according to seven climate models showed a wide range of results , partly due to difference in the implementation of land cover change, but mostly due to different assumptions on ecosystem albedo, plant phenology and evapotranspiration. There is no agreement on the sign of the temperature change induced by anthropogenic land use change. It is very likely that land use change led to an increase of the Earth albedo with a RF of -0.15  0.10 W m-2, but a net cooling of the surface--accounting for processes that are not limited to the albedo--is about as likely as not.	0
Several natural drivers of climate change operate on multiple time scales. Solar variability takes place at many time scales that include centennial and millennial scales , as the radiant energy output of the Sun changes. Also, variations in the astronomical alignment of the Sun and the Earth  induce cyclical changes in RF, but this is substantial only at millennial and longer time scales . Volcanic forcing is highly episodic, but can have dramatic, rapid impacts on climate. No major asteroid impacts occurred during the reference period  and thus this effect is not considered here. This section discusses solar and volcanic forcings, the two dominant natural contributors of climate change since the pre-industrial time.	0
In earlier IPCC reports the forcing was estimated as the instantaneous RF at TOA. However, due to wavelength-albedo dependence, solar radiation-wavelength dependence and absorption within the stratosphere and the resulting stratospheric adjustment, the RF is reduced to about 78% of the TOA instantaneous RF . There is low confidence in the exact value of this number, which can be model and time scale dependent . AR4 gives an 11-year running mean instantaneous TOA RF between 1750 and the present of 0.12 W m-2 with a range of estimates of 0.06 to 0.30 W m-2, equivalent to a RF of 0.09 W m-2 with a range of 0.05 to 0.23 W m-2. For a consistent treatment of all forcing agents, hereafter we use 688	0
8.4.1.1 Satellite Measurements of Total Solar Irradiance Total solar irradiance  measured by the Total Irradiance Monitor  on the spaceborne Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment  is 1360.8  0.5 W m-2 during 2008  which is ~4.5 W m-2 lower than the Physikalisch-Meteorologisches Observatorium Davos  TSI composite during 2008 .The difference is probably due to instrumental biases in measurements prior to TIM. Measurements with the PREcision MOnitor Sensor  instrument support the TIM absolute values . The TIM calibration is also better linked to national standards which provides further support that it is the most accurate . Given the lower TIM TSI values relative to currently used standards, most general circulation models are calibrated to incorrectly high values. However, the few tenths of a percent bias in the absolute TSI value has minimal consequences for climate simulations because the larger uncertainties in cloud properties have a greater effect on the radiative balance. As the maximum-to-minimum TSI relative change is well-constrained from observations, and historical variations are calculated as changes relative to modern values, a revision of the absolute value of TSI affects RF by the same fraction as it affects TSI. The downward revision of TIM TSI with respect to PMOD, being 0.3%, thus has a negligible impact on RF, which is given with a relative uncertainty of several tenths of a percent. Since 1978, several independent space-based instruments have directly measured the TSI. Three main composite series were constructed, referred to as the Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor  , the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium   and the PMOD  series. There are two major differences between ACRIM and PMOD. The first is the rapid drift in calibration between PMOD and ACRIM before 1981. This arises because both composites employ the Hickey- Frieden  radiometer data for this interval, while a re-evaluation of the early HF degradation has been implemented by PMOD but not by ACRIM. The second one, involving also RMIB, is the bridging of the gap between the end of ACRIM I  and the beginning of ACRIM II  observations, as it is possible that a change in HF data occurred during this gap. This possibility is neglected in ACRIM and thus its TSI increases by more than 0.5 W m-2 during solar cycle  22. These differences lead to different long-term TSI trends in the three composites : ACRIM rises until 1996 and subsequently declines, RMIB has an upward trend through 2008 and PMOD shows a decline since 1986 which unlike the other two composites, follows the solar-cycle-averaged sunspot number . Moreover, the ACRIM trend implies that the TSI on time scales longer than the SC is positively correlated with the cosmic ray variation indicating a decline in TSI throughout most of the 20th century . Furthermore, extrapolating the ACRIM TSI long-term drift would imply a brighter Sun in the Maunder minimum  than now, again opposite to most TSI reconstructions . Finally, analysis of instrument degradation and pointing issues  and independent modeling based on solar magnetograms	0
confirm the need for correction of HF data, and we conclude that PMOD is more accurate than the other composites. TSI variations of approximately 0.1% were observed between the maximum and minimum of the 11-year SC in the three composites mentioned above . This variation is mainly due to an interplay between relatively dark sunspots, bright faculae and bright network elements . A declining trend since 1986 in PMOD solar minima is evidenced in Figure 8.10. Considering the PMOD solar minima values of 1986 and 2008, the RF is -0.04 W m-2. Our assessment of the uncertainty range of changes in TSI between 1986 and 2008 is -0.08 to 0.0 W m-2 and thus very likely negative, and includes the uncertainty in the PMOD data  but is extended to also take into account the uncertainty of combining the satellite data. For incorporation of TIM data with the previous and overlapping data, in Figure 8.10 we have standardized the composite time series to the TIM series (over 2003-2012, the procedure is explained in Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.6. Moreover as we consider annual averages, ACRIM and PMOD start at 1979 because for 1978 both composites have only two months of data.	0
on physical modeling of the evolution of solar surface magnetic flux, and its relationship with sunspot group number  and sunspot umbra and penumbra and faculae afterwards. This provides a more detailed reconstruction than other models . The best estimate from our assessment of the most reliable TSI reconstruction gives a 7-year running mean RF between the minima of 1745 and 2008 of 0.05 W m-2. Our assessment of the range of RF from TSI changes is 0.0 to 0.10 W m-2 which covers several updated reconstructions using the same 7-year running mean past-to-present minima years , see Supplementary Material Table 8.SM.4. All reconstructions rely on indirect proxies that inherently do not give consistent results. There are relatively large discrepancies among the models .With these considerations, we adopt this value and range for AR5. This RF is almost half of that in AR4, in part because the AR4 estimate was based on the previous solar cycle minimum while the AR5 estimate includes the drop of TSI in 2008 compared to the previous two SC minima . Concerning the uncertainty range, in AR4 the upper limit corresponded to the reconstruction of Lean , based on the reduced brightness of non-cycling Sun-like stars assumed typical of a Maunder minimum  state. The use of such stellar analogues was based on the work of Baliunas and Jastrow , but more recent surveys have not reproduced their results and suggest that the selection of the original set was flawed ; the lower limit from 1750 to present in AR4 was due to the assumed increase in the amplitude of the 11-year cycle only. Thus the RF and uncertainty range have been obtained in a different way in AR5 compared to AR4. Maxima to maxima RF give a higher estimate than minima to minima RF, but the latter is more relevant for changes in solar activity. Given the medium agreement and medium evidence, this RF value has a medium confidence level . Figure 8.11 shows several TSI reconstructions modelled using sunspot group numbers (Wang et al., 2005; Krivova et al., 2010;	0
8.4.1.2 Total Solar Irradiance Variations Since Preindustrial Time The year 1750, which is used as the preindustrial reference for estimating RF, corresponds to a maximum of the 11-year SC. Trend analysis are usually performed over the minima of the solar cycles that are more stable. For such trend estimates, it is then better to use the closest SC minimum, which is in 1745. To avoid trends caused by comparing different portions of the solar cycle, we analyze TSI changes using multi-year running means. For the best estimate we use a recent TSI reconstruction by Krivova et al.  between 1745 and 1973 and from 1974 to 2012 by Ball et al. . The reconstruction is based	0
For the MM-to-present AR4 gives a TOA instantaneous RF range of 0.1 to 0.28 W m-2, equivalent to 0.08 to 0.22 W m-2 with the RF definition used here. The reconstructions in Schmidt et al.  indicate a MM-to-present RF range of 0.08 to 0.18 W m-2, which is within the AR4 range although narrower. As discussed above, the estimates based on irradiance changes in Sun-like stars are not included in this range because the methodology has been shown to be flawed. A more detailed explanation of this is found in Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.6. For details about TSI reconstructions on millennia time scales see Section 5.2.1.2.	0
8.4.1.3 Attempts to Estimate Future Centennial Trends of Total Solar Irradiance Cosmogenic isotope and sunspot data  reveal that currently the Sun is in a grand activity maximum that began about 1920 . However, SC 23 showed an activity decline not previously seen in the satellite era . Most current estimations suggest that the forthcoming solar cycles will have lower TSI than those for the past 30 years . Also there are indications that the mean magnetic field in sunspots may be diminishing on decadal level. A linear expansion of the current trend may indicate that of the order of half the sunspot activity may disappear by about 2015 . These studies only suggest that the Sun may have left the 20th century grand maximum and not that it is entering another grand minimum. But other works propose a grand minimum during the 21st century, estimating an RF within a range of -0.16 to 0.12 W m-2 between this future minimum and the present-day TSI . However, much more evidence is needed and at present there is very low confidence concerning future solar forcing estimates. Nevertheless, even if there is such decrease in the solar activity, there is a high confidence that the TSI RF variations will be much smaller in magnitude than the projected increased forcing due to GHG .	0
Solar spectral irradiance  variations in the far  and middle  ultraviolet  are the primary driver for heating, composition, and dynamic changes of the stratosphere, and although these wavelengths compose a small portion of the incoming radiation they show large relative variations between the maximum and minimum of the SC compared to the corresponding TSI changes. As UV heating of the stratosphere over a SC has the potential to influence the troposphere indirectly, through dynamic coupling, and therefore climate , the UV may have a more significant impact on climate than changes in TSI alone would suggest. Although this indicates that metrics based only on TSI are not appropriate, UV measurements present several controversial issues and modelling is not yet robust. Multiple space-based measurements made in the past 30 years indicated that UV variations account for about 30% of the SC TSI variations, while about 70% were produced within the visible and infrared . However, current models and data provide the range of 30 to 90% for the contribution of the UV variability below 400 nm to TSI changes , with a more probable value of ~60% . The Spectral Irradiance Monitor  on board SORCE  shows, over the SC 23 declining phase, measurements that are rather inconsistent with prior understanding, indicating that additional validation and uncertainty estimates are needed . A wider exposition can be found in Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.6. 8.4.1.4.3	0
The Krivova et al.  reconstruction is based on what is known about spectral contrasts of different surface magnetic features and the relationship between TSI and magnetic fields. The authors interpolated backwards to the year 1610 based on sunspot group numbers and magnetic information. The Lean  model is based on historical sunspot number and area and is scaled in the UV using measurements from the Solar Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment  on board the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite . The results show smoothed 11-year UV SSI changes between 1750 and the present of about 25% at about 120 nm, about 8% at 130 to 175 nm, ~4% at 175 to 200 nm, and about 0.5% at 200 to 350 nm. Thus, the UV SSI appears to have generally increased over the past four centuries, with larger trends at shorter wavelengths. As few reconstructions are available, and recent measurements suggest a poor understanding of UV variations and their relationship with solar activity, there is very low confidence in these values.	0
8.4.1.5 The Effects of Cosmic Rays on Clouds Changing cloud amount or properties modify the Earth's albedo and therefore affect climate. It has been hypothesized that cosmic ray flux create atmospheric ions which facilitates aerosol nucleation and new particle formation with a further impact on cloud formation . High solar activity means a stronger heliospheric magnetic field and thus a more efficient screen against cosmic rays. Under the hypothesis underlined above, the reduced cosmic ray flux would promote fewer clouds amplifying the warming effect expected from high solar activity. There is evidence from laboratory, field and modelling studies that ionization from cosmic ray flux may enhance aerosol nucleation in the free troposphere . However, there is high confidence  that the cosmic ray- ionization mechanism is too weak to influence global concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei or their change over the last century or during a SC in a climatically significant way . A detailed exposition is found in Section 7.4.6.	0
8.4.2.1 Introduction Volcanic eruptions that inject substantial amounts of SO2 gas into the stratosphere are the dominant natural cause of externally forced climate change on the annual and multi-decadal time scales, both because of the multi-decadal variability of eruptions and the time scale of the climate system response, and can explain much of the pre-industrial climate change of the last millennium . Although volcanic eruptions inject both mineral particles  and sulphate aerosol precursor gases  into the atmosphere, it is the sulphate aerosols, which because of their small size are effective scatterers of sunlight and have long lifetimes, that are responsible for RF important for climate. Global annually averaged emissions of CO2 from volcanic eruptions since 1750 have been at least 100 times smaller than anthropogenic emissions and inconsequential for climate on millennial and shorter time scales . To be important for climate change, sulphur must be injected into the stratosphere, as the lifetime of aerosols in the troposphere is only about one week, whereas sulphate aerosols in the stratosphere from tropical eruptions have a lifetime of about one year, and those from high-latitude eruptions last several months. Most stratospheric aerosols are from explosive eruptions that directly put sulphur into the stratosphere, but Bourassa et al.  showed that sulphur injected into the upper troposphere can then be lifted into the stratosphere over the next month or two by deep convection and large scale Asian summer monsoon circulation, although Vernier et al.  and Fromm et al.  suggested that direct injection was also important. Robock , AR4  and Timmreck  provide summaries of this relatively well understood forcing agent. There have been no major volcanic eruptions since Mt Pinatubo in 1991 , but several smaller eruptions have caused a RF for the years 2008-2011 of -0.11  W m-2, approximately	0
twice the magnitude of the 1999-2002 RF of -0.06  W m-2, consistent with the trends noted in Solomon et al. . However, the CMIP5 simulations discussed elsewhere in this report did not include the recent small volcanic forcing in their calculations. New work has also produced a better understanding of high latitude eruptions, the hydrological response to volcanic eruptions , better long-term records of past volcanism and better understanding of the effects of very large eruptions. There are several ways to measure both the SO2 precursor and sulphate aerosols in the stratosphere, using balloons, airplanes, and both ground- and satellite-based remote sensing. Both the infrared and ultraviolet signals sensed by satellite instruments can measure SO2, and stratospheric aerosol measurements by space-based sensors have been made on a continuous basis since 1978 by a number of instruments employing solar and stellar occultation, limb scattering, limb emission, and lidar strategies . Forster et al.  described four mechanisms by which volcanic forcing influences climate: RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction; differential  heating, producing gradients and changes in circulation; interactions with other modes of circulation, such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation ; and ozone depletion with its effects on stratospheric heating, which depends on anthropogenic chlorine . In addition, the enhanced diffuse light from volcanic aerosol clouds impacts vegetation and hence the carbon cycle  and aerosol-cloud interaction of sulphate aerosols on clouds in the troposphere can also be important , though Frolicher et al.  showed that the impacts of the 1991 Mt Pinatubo eruption on the carbon cycle were small.	0
8.4.2.2 Recent Eruptions The background stratospheric aerosol concentration was affected by several small eruptions in the first decade of the 21st century , with a very small contribution from tropospheric pollution , and had a small impact on RF . Two recent high-latitude eruptions, of Kasatochi Volcano  on August 8, 2008 and of Sarychev Volcano  on June 12-16, 2009, each injected ~1.5 Tg into the stratosphere, but did not produce detectable climate response. Their eruptions, however, led to better understanding of the dependence of the amount of material and time of year of high-latitude injections to produce climate impacts . The RF from high-latitude eruptions is a function of seasonal distribution of insolation and the 3- to 4-month lifetime of high-latitude volcanic aerosols. Kravitz and Robock  showed that high-latitude eruptions must inject at least 5 Tg into the lower stratosphere in the spring or summer, and much more in fall or winter, to have a detectible climatic response. On April 14, 2010 the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland  began an explosive eruption phase that shut down air traffic 691	0
in Europe for 6 days and continued to disrupt it for another month. The climatic impact of Eyjafjallajokull was about 10,000 times less than that of Mt Pinatubo; however, because it emitted less than 50 ktonnes SO2 and its lifetime in the troposphere was 50 times less than if it had been injected into the stratosphere, and was therefore undetectable amidst the chaotic weather noise in the atmosphere . 2011 saw the continuation of a number of small eruptions with significant tropospheric SO2 and ash injections, including Puyehue-Cordon Caulle in Chile, Nabro in Eritrea, and Grimsvotn in Iceland. None have been shown to have produced an important RF, but the June 13, 2011 Nabro eruption resulted in the largest stratospheric aerosol cloud since the 1991 Mt Pinatubo eruption , more than 1.5 Tg. Figure 8.12 shows reconstructions of volcanic aerosol optical depth since 1750. Figure 8.13 shows details of the vertical distribution of stratospheric aerosols in the tropics since 1985. The numerous small eruptions in the past decade are evident, but some of them were at higher latitudes and their full extent is not captured in this plot.	0

Box 8.3 | Volcanic Eruptions as Analogues Volcanic eruptions provide a natural experiment of a stratospheric aerosol cloud that can serve to inform us of the impacts of the proposed production of such a cloud as a means to control the climate, which is one method of geoengineering ; see Section 7.7. For example, Trenberth and Dai  showed that the Asian and African summer monsoon, as well as the global hydrological cycle, was weaker for the year following the 1991 Mt Pinatubo eruption, which is consistent with climate model simulations . MacMynowski et al.  showed that because the climate system response of the hydrological cycle is rapid, forcing from volcanic eruptions, which typically last about a year, can serve as good analogues for longer-lived forcing. The formation of sulphate aerosols, their transport and removal, their impacts on ozone chemistry, their RF, and the impacts on whitening skies all also serve as good analogues for geoengineering proposals. Volcanic impacts on the carbon cycle because of more diffuse radiation  and on remote sensing can also be useful analogues, and the impacts of contrail-generated sub-visual cirrus  can be used to test the long-term impacts of a permanent stratospheric cloud.	0
Smoke from fires generated by nuclear explosions on cities and industrial areas, which could be lofted into the stratosphere, would cause surface cooling and a reduction of stratospheric ozone . Volcanic eruptions that produce substantial stratospheric aerosol clouds also serve as an analogue that supports climate model simulations of the transport and removal of stratospheric aerosols, their impacts on ozone chemistry, their RF, and the climate response. The use of the current global nuclear arsenal still has the potential to produce nuclear winter, with continental temperatures below freezing in summer , and the use of only 100 nuclear weapons could produce climate change unprecedented in recorded human history , with significant impacts on global agriculture .	0
8.4.2.3 Records of Past Volcanism and Effects of Very Large Eruptions Although the effects of volcanic eruptions on climate are largest in the 2 years following a large stratospheric injection, and the winter warming effect in the NH has been supported by long-term records , there is new work indicating extended volcanic impacts via long-term memory in the ocean heat content and sea level . Zanchettin et al.  found changes in the North Atlantic Ocean circulation that imply strengthened northward oceanic heat transport a decade after major eruptions, which contributes to the emergence of extensive winter warming over the continental NH along with persistent cooling over Arctic regions on decadal time scales, in agreement with Zhong et al.  and Miller et al. . New work on the mechanisms by which a supereruption  could force climate has focused on the 74,000 BP eruption of the Toba volcano . Robock et al.  used simulations of up to 900 times the 1991 Mt Pinatubo sulphate injection to show that the forcing is weaker than that predicted based on a linear relationship with the sulphate aerosol injection. The results agreed with a previous simulation by Jones et al. . They also showed that chemical interactions with ozone had small impacts on the forcing and that the idea of Bekki et al.  that water vapour would limit and prolong the growth of aerosols was not supported. Timmreck et al.  however, incorporating the idea of Pinto et al.  that aerosols would grow and therefore both have less RF per unit mass and fall out of the atmosphere more quickly, found much less of a radiative impact from such a large stratospheric input.	0
8.4.2.4 Future Effects We expect large eruptions over the next century but cannot predict when. Ammann and Naveau  and Stothers  suggested an 80-year periodicity in past eruptions, but the data record is quite short and imperfect, and there is no mechanism proposed that would cause this. While the period 1912-1963 was unusual for the past 500 years in having no large volcanic eruptions, and the period 1250-1300 had the most globally climatically significant eruptions in the past 1500 years , current knowledge only allows us to predict such periods on a statistical basis, assuming that the recent past distributions are stationary. Ammann and Naveau , Gusev , and Deligne et al.  studied these statistical properties and Ammann and Naveau  showed how they could be used to produce a statistical distribution for future simulations. Although the future forcing from volcanic eruptions will depend only on the stratospheric aerosol loading for most forcing mechanisms, the future effects on reducing ozone will diminish as ozone depleting substances diminish in the future .	0
value within the estimated range. Some of the RF agents have robust evidence such as WMGHG with well documented increases based on high precision measurements as well as contrails as additional clouds which can be seen by direct observations. However, for some forcing agents the evidence is more limited regarding their existence such as aerosol influence on cloud cover. The consistency in the findings for a particular forcing agent determines the evaluation of the evidence. A combination of different methods, for example, observations and modeling, and thus the understanding of the processes causing the forcing is important for this evaluation. The agreement is a qualitative judgment of the difference between the various estimates for a particular RF agent. Figure 1.11 shows how the combined evidence and agreement results in five levels for the confidence level.	0
Table 8.5 | Confidence level for the forcing estimate associated with each forcing agent for the 1750-2011 period. The confidence level is based on the evidence and the agreement as given in the table. The basis for the confidence level and change since AR4 is provided. See Figure 1.11 for further description of the evidence, agreement and confidence level. The colours are adopted based on the evidence and agreement shown in Figure 1.11. Dark green is "High agreement and Robust evidence", light green is either "High agreement and Medium evidence" or "Medium agreement and Robust evidence", yellow is either "High agreement and limited evidence" or "Medium agreement and Medium evidence" or "Low agreement and Robust evidence", orange is either "Medium agreement and Limited evidence" or "Low agreement and Medium evidence" and finally red is "Low agreement and Limited evidence". Note, that the confidence levels given in Table 8.5 are for 2011 relative to 1750 and for some of the agents the confidence level may be different for certain portions of the Industrial Era.	0
Evidence is robust for several of the RF agents because of long term observations of trends over the industrial era and well defined links between atmospheric or land surfaced changes and their radiative effects. Evidence is medium for a few agents where the anthropogenic changes or the link between the forcing agent and its radiative effect are less certain. Medium evidence can be assigned in cases where observations or modelling provide a diversity of information and thus not a consistent picture for a given forcing agent. We assess the evidence to be limited only for rapid adjusment associated with aerosol- cloud interaction where model studies in some cases indicate changes but direct observations of cloud alterations are scarce. High agreement is given only for the WMGHG where the relative uncertainties in the RF estimates are much smaller than for the other RF agents. Low agreement can either be due to large diversity in estimates of the magnitude of the forcing or from the fact that the method to estimate the forcing has a large uncertainty. Stratospheric water vapour is an example of the latter with modest difference in the few available estimates but a known large uncertainty in the radiative transfer calculations .	0
used instead of confidence level. For comparison with previous IPCC assessments the LOSU is converted approximately to confidence level. Note that LOSU and confidence level use different terms for their rankings. The figure shows generally increasing confidence levels but also that more RF mechanisms have been included over time. The confidence levels for the RF due to aerosol-radiation interactions, surface albedo due to land use and volcanic aerosols have been raised and are now at the same ranking as those for change in stratospheric and tropospheric ozone. This is due to an increased understanding of key parameteres and their uncertainties for the elevated RF agents. For tropospheric and stratospheric ozone changes, research has shown further complexities with changes primarily influencing the troposphere or the stratosphere being linked to some extent . The rapid adjustment associated with aerosol-cloud interactions is given the confidence level very low and had a similar level in AR4. For rapid adjustment associated with aerosol-radiation interactions  the confidence level is low and is raised compared to AR4, as the evidence is improved and is now medium .	0
Figure 8.14 | Confidence level of the forcing mechanisms in the 4 last IPCC assessments. In the previous IPCC assessments the level of scientific understanding  has been adopted instead of confidence level, but for comparison with previous IPCC assessments the LOSU is converted approximately to confidence level. The thickness of the bars represents the relative magnitude of the current forcing . LOSU for the RF mechanisms was not available in the first IPCC Assessment . Rapid adjustments associated with aerosol-cloud interactions  which include what was previously referred to as the second indirect aerosol effect or cloud lifetime effect whereas rapid adjustments associated with aerosol-radiation interactions  were previously referred to as the semi-direct effect . In AR4 the confidence level for aerosol-cloud interaction was given both for RF due to aerosol-cloud interaction and rapid adjustment associated with aerosol-cloud interaction. Generally the aerosol-cloud interaction is not separated into various components in AR5, hence the confidence levels for ERF due to aerosol-cloud interaction in AR5 and for RF due to aerosol-cloud interaction from previous IPCC reports are compared. The confidence level for the rapid adjustment associated with aerosol-cloud interaction is comparable for AR4 and AR5. The colours are adopted based on the evidence and agreement shown in Figure 1.11. Dark green is "High agreement and Robust evidence", light green is either "High agreement and Medium evidence" or "Medium agreement and Robust evidence", yellow is either "High agreement and limited evidence" or "Medium agreement and Medium evidence" or "Low agreement and Robust evidence", orange is either "Medium agreement and Limited evidence" or "Low agreement and Medium evidence" and finally red is "Low agreement and Limited evidence".	0
respectively. This is due mainly to increased concentrations , whereas the other changes for the anthropogenic RF agents compared to AR4 are due to re-evaluations and in some cases from improved understanding. An increased number of studies, additional observational data and better agreement between models and observations can be the causes for such re-evaluations. The best estimates for RF due to aerosol-radiation interactions, BC on snow and solar irradiance are all substantially decreased in magnitude compared to AR4; otherwise the modifications to the best estimates are rather small. For the RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction and BC on snow the changes in the estimates are based on additional new studies since AR4 . For the change in the estimate of the solar irradiance it is a combination on how the RF is calculated, new evidence showing some larger earlier estimates were incorrect, and a downward trend observed during recent years in the solar activity that has been taken into account . The estimate for ERF due to to aerosol-cloud interaction includes rapid adjustment but still this ERF is smaller in magnitude than the AR4 RF estimate due to aerosol-cloud interactions without rapid adjustments . The uncertainties for ERF due to CO2 increase when compared to RF . We assume the relative ERF uncertainties for CO2 apply to all WMGHG. For the shortlived GHG we do not have sufficient information to include separate ERF uncertainty to each of these forcing agents .	0
 owever, for these forcing mechanisms the RF uncertainties are larger H than for the WMGHG and thus it is unlikely that rapid adjustments change the uncertainties substantially. Figure 8.15 shows the RF for agents listed in Table 8.6 over the 1750-2011 period. The methods for calculation of forcing estimates are described in Section 8.3 and 8.4. For some of the components the forcing estimates are based on observed abundance whereas some are estimated from a combination of model simulations and observations and for others are purely model based. Solid bars are given for ERF, whereas RF values are given as  hatched bars. Similarly the uncertainties are given for ERF in solid lines and dotted lines for RF. An important assumption is that different forcing mechanisms can be treated additively to calculate the total forcing . Total ERF over the Industrial Era calculated from Monte Carlo simulations are shown in Figure 8.16, with a best estimate of 2.29 W m-2. For each of the forcing agents a probability density function  is generated based on uncertainties provided in Table 8.6. The combination of the individual RF agents to derive total forcing follows the same approach as in AR4  which is based on the method in Boucher and Haywood . The PDF of the GHGs  has a more narrow shape than the PDF for the aerosols owing to the much lower relative uncertainty.	0
Figure 8.16 | Probability density function  of ERF due to total GHG, aerosol forcing and total anthropogenic forcing. The GHG consists of WMGHG, ozone and stratospheric water vapour. The PDFs are generated based on uncertainties provided in Table 8.6. The combination of the individual RF agents to derive total forcing over the Industrial Era are done by Monte Carlo simulations and based on the method in Boucher and Haywood . PDF of the ERF from surface albedo changes and combined contrails and contrail-induced cirrus are included in the total anthropogenic forcing, but not shown as a separate PDF. We currently do not have ERF estimates for some forcing mechanisms: ozone, land use, solar, etc. For these forcings we assume that the RF is representative of the ERF and for the ERF uncertainty an additional uncertainty of 17% has been included in quadrature to the RF uncertainty. See Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.7 and Table 8.SM.4 for further description on method and values used in the calculations. Lines at the top of the figure compare the best estimates and uncertainty ranges  with RF estimates from AR4.	0
Therefore, the large uncertainty in the aerosol forcing is the main cause of the large uncertainty in the total anthropogenic ERF. The total anthropogenic forcing is virtually certain to be positive with the probability for a negative value less than 0.1%. Compared to AR4 the total anthropogenic ERF is more strongly positive with an increase of 43%. This is caused by a combination of growth in GHG concentration, and thus strengthening in forcing of WMGHG, and weaker ERF estimates of aerosols  as a result of new assessments of these effects. Figure 8.17 shows the forcing over the Industrial Era by emitted compounds . It is more complex to view the RF by emitted species than by change in atmospheric abundance  since the number of emitted compounds and changes leading to RF is larger than the number of compounds causing RF directly . The main reason for this is the indirect effect of several compounds and in particular components involved in atmospheric chemistry . To estimate the RF by the emitted compounds in some cases the emission over the entire Industrial Era is needed  whereas for other compounds  quite complex simulations are required . CO2 is the dominant positive forcing both by abundance and by emitted compound. Emissions of CH4, CO, and NMVOC all lead to excess CO2 as one end product if the carbon is of fossil origin and is the reason why the RF of direct CO2 emissions is slightly lower than the RF of abundance change of CO2. For CH4 the contribution from emission is estimated to be almost twice as large as that from the CH4 concen697	0
tration change, 0.97  W m-2 versus 0.48  W m-2, respectively. This is because emission of CH4 leads to ozone production, stratospheric water vapour, CO2 , and importantly affects its own lifetime . Actually, emissions of CH4 would lead to a stronger RF via the direct CH4 greenhouse effect  than the RF from abundance change of CH4 . This is because other compounds have influenced the lifetime of CH4 and reduced the abundance of CH4, most notably NOx. Emissions of CO  W m-2) and NMVOC  W m-2) have only indirect effects on RF through ozone production, CH4 and CO2 and thus contribute an overall positive RF. Emissions of NOX, on the other hand, have indirect effects that lead to positive RF through ozone production and also effects that lead to negative RF through	0
reduction of CH4 lifetime and thus its c oncentration, and through contributions to nitrate aerosol formation. The best estimate of the overall effect of anthropogenic emissions of NOX is a negative RF  W m-2). Emissions of ammonia also contribute to nitrate aerosol formation, with a small offset due to compensating changes in sulphate aerosols. Additionally indirect effects from sulphate on atmospheric compounds are not included here as models typically simulate a small effect, but there are large relative differences in the response between models. Impacts of emissions other than CO2 on the carbon cycle via changes in atmospheric composition  are also not shown owing to the limited amount of available information. For the WMGHG, the ERF best estimate is the same as the RF. The uncertainty range is slightly larger, however. The total emission-based ERF of WMGHG is 3.00  W m-2. That of CO2 is 1.68  W m-2; that of CH4 is 0.97  W m-2; that of stratospheric ozone-depleting halocarbons is 0.18  W m-2. Emissions of BC have a positive RF through aerosol-radiation interactions and BC on snow . The emissions from the various compounds are co-emitted; this is in particular the case for BC and OC from biomass burning aerosols. The net RF of biomass burning emissions for aerosol-radiation interactions is close to zero, but with rather strong positive RF from BC and negative RF from OC . The ERF due to aerosol-cloud interactions is caused by primary anthropogenic emissions of BC, OC and dust as well as secondary aerosol from anthropogenic emissions of SO2, NOX and NH3. However, quantification of the contribution from the various components to the ERF due to aerosol-cloud interactions has not been attempted in this assessment.	0

Numerical values and their uncertainties are shown in Supplementary Material Tables 8.SM.6 and 8.SM.7. Note that a certain part of CH4 attribution is not straightforward and discussed further in Section 8.3.3. Red  and blue  are used for emitted components which affect few forcing agents, whereas for emitted components affecting many compounds several colours are used as indicated in the inset at the upper part the figure. The vertical bars indicate the relative uncertainty of the RF induced by each component. Their length is proportional to the thickness of the bar, that is, the full length is equal to the bar thickness for a 50% uncertainty. The net impact of the individual contributions is shown by a diamond symbol and its uncertainty  is given by the horizontal error bar. ERFaci is ERF due to aerosol-cloud interaction. BC and OC are co-emitted, especially for biomass burning emissions  and to a large extent also for fossil and biofuel emissions . SOA have not been included because the formation depends on a variety of factors not currently sufficiently quantified.	0
The time evolution of global mean forcing is shown in Figure 8.18 for the Industrial Era. Over all time periods during the Industrial Era CO2 and other WMGHG have been the dominant term, except for shorter periods with strong volcanic eruptions. The time evolution shows an almost continuous increase in the magnitude of anthropogenic ERF. This is the case both for CO2 and other WMGHGs as well as several individual aerosol components. The forcing from CO2 and other WMGHGs has increased somewhat faster since the 1960s. Emissions of CO2 have made the largest contribution to the increased anthropogenic forcing in every decade since the 1960s. The total aerosol ERF  has the strongest negative forcing , with a strengthening in the magnitude similar to many of the other anthropogenic forcing mechanisms with time. The global mean forcing of aerosol-radiation interactions was rather weak until 1950 but strengthened in the latter half of the last century and in particular in the period between 1950 and 1980. The RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction by aerosol component is shown in Section 8.3.4 . Although there is high confidence for a substantial enhancement in the negative aerosol forcing in the period 1950-1980, there is much more uncertainty in the relative change in global mean aerosol forcing over the last two decades . Over the last two decades there has been a strong geographic shift in aerosol and aerosol precursor	0
The volcanic RF has a very irregular temporal pattern and for certain years has a strongly negative RF. There has not been a major volcanic eruption in the past decade, but some weaker eruptions give a current RF that is slightly negative relative to 1750 and slightly stronger in magnitude compared to 1999-2002 . Figure 8.19 shows linear trends in forcing  over four different time periods. Three of the periods are the same as chosen in Box 9.2  and the period 1970-2011 is shown in Box 13.1. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to derive uncertainties in the forcing based on ranges given in Table 8.6 and the derived linear trends. Further, these uncertainties are combined with uncertainties derived from shifting time periods 2 years and the full 90% confidence range is shown in Figure 8.19 . For the anthropogenic forcing sensitivity to the selection of time periods is very small with a maximum contribution to the uncertainties shown in Figure 8.19 of 2%. However, for the natural forcing the sensitivity to time periods is the dominant contributor to the overall uncertainty  for the relatively short periods 1998-2011 and 1984-1998, whereas this is not the case for the longer periods. For the 1998-2011 period the natural forcing is very likely negative and has offset 2 to 89% of the anthropogenic forcing. It is likely that the natural forcing change has offset at least 30% of the anthropogenic forcing increase and very likely that it has offset at least 10% of the anthropogenic increase. For the 1998-2011 period both the volcanic and solar forcings contribute to this negative natural forcing, with the latter dominating. For the other periods shown in Figure 8.19 the best estimate of the natural is much smaller in magnitude than the anthropogenic forcing, but note that the natural forcing is very dependent on the selection of time period near the 1984-1998 interval. Over the period 1951-2011 the trend in anthropogenic forcing is almost 0.3 W m-2 per decade and thus anthropogenic forcing over this period is more than 1.5 W m-2. The anthropogenic forcing for 1998-2011 is 30% higher and with smaller uncertainty than for the 1951-2011 period. Note that due to large WMGHG forcing  the anthropogenic forcing was similar in the late 1970s and early 1980s to the 1998-2011 period. The reason for the reduced uncertainty in the 1998-2011 anthropogenic forcing	0
e missions , and there are some uncertainties in these emissions . In addition to the regional changes in the aerosol forcing there is also likely a competition between various aerosol effects. Emission data indicate a small increase in the BC emissions  but model studies also indicate a weak enhancement of other aerosol types. Therefore, the net aerosol forcing depends on the balance between absorbing and scattering aerosols for aerosol-radiation interaction as well as balance between the changes in aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions. In the ACCMIP models, for example, the RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction becomes less negative during 1980 to 2000, but total aerosol ERF becomes more negative . There is a very low confidence for the trend in the total aerosol forcing during the past two to three decades, even the sign; however, there is high confidence that the offset from aerosol forcing to WMGHG forcing during this period was much smaller than over the 1950-1980 period.	0
Figure 8.18 | Time evolution of forcing for anthropogenic and natural forcing mechanisms. Bars with the forcing and uncertainty ranges  at present are given in the right part of the figure. For aerosol the ERF due to aerosol- radiation interaction and total aerosol ERF are shown. The uncertainty ranges are for present  and are given in Table 8.6. For aerosols, only the uncertainty in the total aerosol ERF is given. For several of the forcing agents the relative uncertainty may be larger for certain time periods compared to present. See Supplementary Material Table 8.SM.8 for further information on the forcing time evolutions. Forcing numbers provided in Annex II. The total antropogenic forcing was 0.57  W m-2 in 1950, 1.25  W m-2 in 1980 and 2.29  W m-2 in 2011.	0
is the larger domination of WMGHG forcing and smaller contribution from aerosol forcing compared to previous periods. Similar to the results for 1970-2011 in Figure 8.19, Box 13.1 shows that the global energy budget is dominated by anthropogenic forcing compared to the natural forcing, except for the two major volcanic eruption in this period as can be easily seen in Figure 8.18. Figure 8.20 shows the forcing between 1980 and 2011. Compared to the whole Industrial Era the dominance of the CO2 is larger for this recent period both with respect to other WMGHG and the total anthropogenic RF. The forcing due to aerosols is rather weak leading	0
to a very strong net positive ERF for the 1980-2011 period. More than 40% of the total anthropogenic ERF has occurred over the 1980-2011 period with a value close to 1.0  W m-2. The major contribution to the uncertainties in the time evolution of the anthropogenic forcing is associated with the aerosols . Despite this, anthropogenic ERF is very likely considerably more positive than the natural RF over the decadal time periods since 1950. This is in particular the case after 1980, where satellite data are available that provide important measurements to constrain the natural RF mechanisms  with total natural RF of 0.0  W m-2.	0
Projections of global mean RF are assessed based on results from multiple sources examining the RF due to RCP emissions: the ACCMIP initiative  provides analysis of the RF or ERF due to aerosols and ozone , while WMGHG, land use and stratospheric water RFs are taken from the results of calculations with the reduced-complexity Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change 6  driven by the RCP emissions and land use . While MAGICC6 also estimated ozone and aerosol RF, those values differ substantially from the ACCMIP values and are considered less realistic. Additional discussion of biases in the MAGICC6 results due to the simplified representations 700	0
of atmospheric chemistry and the carbon cycle, along with further discussion on the representativeness of the RCP projections in context with the broader set of scenarios in the literature, is presented in Section 11.3.5 and Section 12.3 . As the ACCMIP project provided projected forcings primarily at 2030 and 2100, we hereafter highlight those times. Although understanding the relative contributions of various processes to the overall effect of aerosols on forcing is useful, we emphasize the total aerosol ERF, which includes all aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions, as this is the most indicative of the aerosol forcing driving climate change. We also present traditional RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction  but do not examine further the various components of aerosol ERF. Aerosol forcing estimates, both mean and uncertainty ranges, are derived from the 10 ACCMIP models, 8 of which are also CMIP5 models. We analyze forcing during the 21st century , and hence the WMGHG forcing changes are in addition to persistent forcing from historical WMGHG increases. Analysis of forcing at 2030 relative to 2000 shows that under RCP2.6, total ozone  forcing is near zero, RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction is positive but small, and hence WMGHG forcing dominates changes over this time period . WMGHG forcing is dominated by increasing CO2, as declining CH4 and increasing N2O have nearly offsetting small contributions to forcing. Aerosol ERF was not evaluated for this RCP under ACCMIP, and values cannot be readily inferred from RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction as these are not directly proportional. Under RCP8.5, RF due to aerosol- radiation interaction in 2030 is weakly negative, aerosol ERF is positive with a fairly small value and large uncertainty range, total ozone forcing is positive but small , and thus WMGHG forcing again dominates with a value exceeding 1 W m-2. As with RCP2.6, WMGHG forcing is dominated by CO2, but under this scenario the other WMGHGs all contribute additional positive forcing. Going to 2100, ozone forcing diverges in sign between the two scenarios, consistent with changes in the tropospheric ozone burden  which are largely attributable to projected CH4 emissions, but is small in either case. Ozone RF is the net impact of a positive forcing from stratospheric ozone recovery owing to reductions in anthropogenic ozone-depleting halocarbon emissions in both scenarios and a larger impact from changes in tropospheric precursors  which have a negative forcing in RCP2.6 and a positive forcing in RCP8.5. The two scenarios are fairly consistent in their trends in RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction by component . There is positive RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction due to reductions in sulfate aerosol. This is largely offset by negative RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction by primary carbonaceous aerosols and especially by nitrate , leaving net aerosol RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction values that are very small, 0.1 W m-2 or less in magnitude, in either scenario at 2030 and 2100. Nitrate aerosols continue to increase through 2100 as ammonia emissions rise steadily due to increased use of agricultural fertilizer even as all other aerosol precursor emissions decrease , including sulphur dioxide which drives the reduction in sulphate aerosol that also contributes to additional formation of nitrate aerosols in the future . Aerosol ERF is likely similar at this time in all scenarios given that they all have greatly	0
Although aerosol ERF becomes less negative by nearly 1 W m-2 from 2000 to 2100, this change is still small compared with the increased WMGHG forcing under RCP8.5, which is roughly 6 W m-2 during this time . Roughly 5 W m-2 of this WMGHG forcing comes from CO2, with substantial additional forcing from increases in both CH4 and nitrous oxide and only a very small negative forcing from reductions in halocarbons. Under RCP2.6, the WMGHG forcing is only about 0.5 W m-2 during this time, as relatively strong decreases in CH4 and halocarbon forcing offset roughly 40% of the increased CO2 forcing, which is itself far less than under RCP8.5. Hence under this scenario, the projected future forcing due to aerosol reductions is actually stronger than the WMGHG forcing. Viewing the timeseries of the various forcings, however, indicates that aerosol ERF is returning to its pre-industrial levels, so that net forcing becomes increasingly dominated by WMGHGs regardless of scenario during the 21st century . As the forcing is so heavily dominated by WMGHGs at 2100, and the WMGHG concentrations  or emissions  were chosen to match forcing targets, all the scenarios show net forcing values at that time that are fairly close to the scenarios' target values. The reduced aerosol forcing, with its large uncertainty, leads to a pronounced decrease in the uncertainty of the total net forcing by 2100. Based on the spread across ACCMIP models , the 90% confidence interval  is about 20% for the 2100 net forcing, versus 26% for 2030 under RCP8.5 and 45-61% for 1980 and 2000 . The total ERF due to all causes has been independently estimated based on the transient response in the CMIP5 models and a linear forcing-response relationship derived through regression of the modelled response to an instantaneous increase in CO2 . Uncertainties based on model spread behave similarly, with the 90% CI for net total ERF decreasing from 53% for 2003 to only 24 to 34% for 2100. Forcing relative to 2000 due to land use  and stratospheric water vapor changes are not shown separately as their projected values under the four RCPs are quite small: -0.09 to 0.00 and -0.03 to 0.10 W m-2, respectively. The CMIP5 forcing estimates  for the total projected 2030 and 2100 ERF are slightly smaller than the results obtained from the ACCMIP models . Examining the subset of models included in both this regression analysis and in ACCMIP shows that the ACCMIP subset show forcings on the low side of the mean value obtained from the full set of CMIP5	0
analyzed, indicating that the discrepancy between the methods is not related to analysis of a different set of models. Instead, it may reflect nonlinearities in the response to forcing that are not represented by the regression analysis of the response to abrupt CO2 increase experiments  or differences in the response to other forcing agents relative to the response to CO2 used in deriving the CMIP5 estimates . Natural forcings will also change in the future. The magnitudes cannot be reliably projected, but are likely to be small at multi-decadal scales . Brief episodic volcanic forcing could be large, however.	0
reduced emissions of all aerosols and aerosol precursors other than ammonia. Aerosol ERF shows a large positive value at 2100 relative to 2000, nearly returning to its 1850 levels , as is expected given the RCP emissions. Thus although some models project large increases in nitrate RF in the future, the reduction in overall aerosol loading appears to lead to such a strong reduction in aerosol ERF that the impact of aerosols becomes very small under these RCPs. Of course the projections of drastic reductions in primary aerosol as well as aerosol and ozone precursor emissions may be overly optimistic as they assume virtually all nations in the world become wealthy and that emissions reductions are directly dependent on wealth. The RCPs also contain substantially lower projected growth in HFC emissions than in some studies .	0
The WMGHGs such as CO2 have the largest forcing in the subtropics, decreasing toward the poles, with the largest forcing in warm and dry regions and smaller values in moist regions and in high-altitude regions . For the NTCFs  their concentration spatial pattern and therefore their RF pattern are highly inhomogeneous, and again meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, clouds, and surface albedo influence how concentration translates to RF. Figure 8.23 shows the RF spatial distribution of the major NTCFs together with standard deviation among the ACCMIP models  the net anthropogenic composition  forcing is also shown . These models used unified anthropogenic emissions of aerosol and ozone precursors , so that the model diversity in RF is due only to differences in model chemical and climate features and natural emissions, and would be larger if uncertainty in the anthropogenic emissions were also included. In general, the confidence in geographical distribution is lower than for global mean, due to uncertainties in chemistry, transport and removal of species. The negative RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction  is greatest in the NH and near populated and biomass burning regions. The standard deviation for the net RF due to aerosol- radiation interaction is typically largest over regions where vegetation changes are largest , due to uncertainties in biomass burning aerosol optical properties and in treatment of secondary organic aerosols. Carbonaceous aerosol forcing  is greatest in South and East Asia and can be negative in biomass burning regions due to large weakly absorbing organic components. Absorbing aerosols also have enhanced positive forcing when they overlie high albedo surfaces such as cryosphere, desert or clouds, with as much as 50% of BC RF resulting from BC above clouds . Figure 8.24 compares the aerosol RFs for ACCMIP , which are representative of the CMIP5 experiments, with those from the AeroCom model intercomparison  which includes sixteen models that used unified meteorology and are more extensively compared to measurements . The forcing results are very similar, establishing the representativeness and validity of the ACCMIP aerosol simulations. The net aerosol ERF , includes both aerosol- radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions. The spatial pattern correlates with the RF , except with stronger effect in the outflow regions over oceans. The flux change is larger in the NH than the 702	0
SH . Rapid adjustment associated with aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions may enhance or reduce cloud cover depending on the region, cloud dynamics and aerosol loading . In general, the ocean-land forcing pattern differs from that reported in AR4, where the forcing due to aerosol-cloud interaction were larger over land than ocean , and this continues to be a source of uncertainty. Since AR4, Quaas et al.  showed using satellite retrievals that the correlation between AOD changes and droplet number changes is stronger over oceans than over land and that models tend to overestimate the strength of the relation over land. Penner et al.  showed that satellite retrievals, due to their dependence on present-day conditions, may underestimate the forcing due to aerosol-cloud interaction, especially over land, although this model analysis may overestimate the cloud condensation nucleus to AOD relation . Wang and Penner  also showed that if models include boundary layer nucleation and increase the fraction of sulphur emitted as a primary particle, the effect over land is increased relative to over ocean . The aerosol ERF standard deviation is large in biomass burning regions, as for the RF, and in regions where cloud effects differ among models . The spread in aerosol ERF is much larger than for the RF alone, although the relative standard deviation is no larger . For components that primarily scatter radiation, the radiative effect at the surface is similar to the RF . However for components that absorb radiation in the atmosphere the radiation reaching the surface is reduced . This absorption of incoming solar radiation alters the vertical temperature profile in the atmospheric column and can thus change atmospheric circulation and cloud formation. The aerosol atmospheric absorption , or the difference between ERF and the analogous radiative flux reaching the surface including rapid adjustments, has a spatial pattern that to lowest order tracks the carbonaceous aerosol forcing, but is also affected by cloud changes, where e.g., cloud loss could enhance atmospheric absorption. Atmospheric aerosol absorption patterns thus mirror the ERF due to aerosol-cloud interaction pattern, with larger forcing over continents. Ozone RF is calculated using the methodology described in Shindell et al. , but applied to the larger set of models in ACCMIP . The net ozone RF  is largest in subtropical latitudes, and is more positive in the NH than the SH. Pollution in the NH accounts for positive tropospheric forcing; stratospheric ozone loss has caused negative SH polar forcing. Model standard deviation is largest in the polar regions where lower stratosphere/ upper troposphere changes differ in the models . Overall, the confidence in aerosol and ozone RF spatial patterns is medium and lower than that for the global mean due to the large regional standard deviations , and is exacerbated in aerosol ERF patterns due to uncertainty in cloud responses.	0

8.6.2.1 Regional Forcing Changes During the Industrial Era The spatial distribution of the WMGHG RF has shifted only slightly over the industrial period; however the RF spatial distributions for NTCFs has shifted with emissions, due to the timing of regional development and implementation of pollution standards . Figure 8.25 shows how the distributions of aerosol and ozone forcings are modelled to have changed up to 1930, 1980 and 2000. Substantial industrial coal-burning in the early part of the 20th century occurred in the northeastern United States and Western Europe, leading to stronger sulphate and BC forcing near those	0
regions . Between 1950 and 1970, coal burning for power generation increased while coal burning for other purposes was replaced by oil and natural gas and motor vehicle usage grew rapidly in these regions, leading to more sulphate and less BC. Peak aerosol forcing in North America and Europe occurred around 1970-1980 , while Asian development led to increased biofuel and fossil fuel sources of aerosols and ozone precursors toward the end of the century. During the final decades of the century, desulphurization controls reduced sulphur emissions from North America and Europe, resulting in reduced negative forcing in these regions and positive Arctic aerosol forcing. The SH ozone hole developed during the final three decades, with negative forcing over high latitudes. Biomass burning generated ozone and carbonaceous aerosols in NH high-latitudes early in the century, with increased tropical burning from mid to late century.	0
Aerosol ERF grew rapidly from 1930 to 1980, as did RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction, with a spatial structure reflecting both the influence of aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions that are especially strong over pollution outflow regions and over areas with high surface albedo. From 1980 to 2000, aerosol ERF continued to become more negative even as negative RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction grew weaker, with the spatial pattern showing strengthening of aerosol ERF over Asia and weakening of aerosol ERF over North America and Europe. Soil dust has changed since the pre-industrial due to land disturbance and resulting desertification  and to changes in climate . Mahowald et al.  showed approximate doubling in dust loading over the 20th century , primarily from the Saharan and Middle Eastern Deserts, with largest increase from the 1950s to the 1980s , followed by a leveling. The increased dustiness reduces model precipitation within the Saharan source region, improving agreement with observed precipitation. Aerosol loading changes during the past century have impacted radiation at the surface , with peak radiation reductions in North America and Europe in the 1980s, and ongoing reduction in South and East Asia . The AR4 and CMIP5 models simulated these trends but underestimated their magnitude, the decadal temperature variations and the diurnal temperature range over land . Changes in spatial patterns of species and their forcing over the century are difficult to validate due to sparse observations of short-lived species. Some constraint comes from limited historical observations in ice core records and from shorter trends beginning in late century from satellite and surface-based site measurements. The emissions estimates for historical species are very uncertain, especially for carbonaceous aerosols and dust. Therefore, the confidence in the historical forcing pattern changes is low for RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction and ozone, and very low for ERF, carbonaceous aerosols and dust.	0
8.6.2.2 Relationship Between Regional Forcing Patterns and Climate Response During the Industrial Era An increasing body of research considers how spatial variations in RF affect climate response. Detection and attribution methods have had limited success in discerning statistically significant regional climate signals from regional forcing, due to large internal climate variability at regional scales, uncertainty in model processes and sparse regional observational records . Meanwhile, research including model sensitivity studies for NTCFs, which vary strongly in space in time, explores climate response patterns. In AR4  it was argued that the spatial pattern of forcing is not indicative of the pattern of climate response. Rather, the response is linked more closely to TOA flux resulting from the climate feedback spatial patterns , with the lapse rate, surface albedo and cloud feedbacks explaining most of the temperature 706	0
response. Yet Crook and Forster  showed that both the spatial distribution of climate feedbacks and of heterogeneous forcing played important roles in the patterns of 20th century temperature changes. Other studies since AR4 have probed relationships between forcing patterns and climate responses. Broad links between forcing and climate response have been identified. Shindell et al.  used multiple models to show that surface temperature changes are much more sensitive to latitudinal than longitudinal variations in forcing. Shindell and Faluvegi  used a model inverse approach to infer that NH aerosol reduction was associated with more than 70% of Arctic warming from the 1970s to the 2000s, and that Arctic and much of the SH surface temperature changes are strongly affected by remote forcing changes . Voulgarakis and Shindell  defined a regional transient temperature sensitivity parameter, or temperature response per unit forcing for each 4-degree latitude band. Using observed surface air temperature changes they showed that the parameter is best constrained from 50S to 25N, where the value is 0.35C -1, smaller than at northern higher latitudes, and 35% smaller than in AR4 models. Some aerosol model studies have demonstrated highly localized climate response to regional forcing. Significant regional cooling and hydrological shifts in the eastern USA and in Eastern Asia during the last half of the 20th century were modelled and attributed to local aerosols  and localized warming projected for aerosol reductions . Observations have also linked historical trends in aerosols and temperature . Since AR4, there has been new research on aerosol influences on the hydrologic cycle . Increased aerosol loading, with greater surface energy flux reduction in the NH, has been implicated in the observed southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone  towards the hemisphere with smaller surface energy reduction: southward up to the 1980s with a reversal since . Several studies have modelled an associated reduction in NH precipitation and associated shifts in the Hadley circulation . The ITCZ shift may in turn be responsible for broad regional precipitation changes, including drying of the Sahel  and northwestern Brazil , both of which peaked in the 1980s. These hemispheric asymmetric ITCZ effects are overlaid on thermodynamic aerosol effects which moisten subtropical regions, countering GHG-induced drying of these regions . Studies indicate that aerosols are more effective than an equivalent WMGHG forcing for shifting precipitation, and that historical trends in several areas cannot be explained without including aerosol forcing . However, confidence in attribution of any human influence on zonal shifts in precipitation distribution is only medium . There is increasing evidence but limited agreement that absorbing aerosols influence cloud distributions . Absorbing	0
a erosols apparently have complex influences on precipitation in monsoon regions. Model studies of Stephens et al.  and Miller et al.  showed that dust absorption over Africa enhances low-level convergence, vertical velocities and therefore local monsoon circulation and precipitation. On the other hand, Kawase et al.  showed that biomass burning BC may cause the decreasing precipitation trend seen in tropical Africa during austral summer, due to reduction in evaporation and enhanced subsidence. The aerosol effects on the Indian monsoon are similarly complex, and have been the subject of numerous studies , but a clear picture of how the regional aerosol forcing correlates with responses has not yet fully emerged. Attribution of changes in monsoon to human influence generally has low confidence .	0
albedo feedback. These forcings can also have non-local impacts that result from enhanced land-ocean temperature contrast, increasing surface convergence over land and divergence over oceans. A poleward intensification of the high pressure patterns and subtropical jet may also result . BC contributions to snow darkening reduces snow cover, however the magnitude of the effect is very uncertain . A model study calculated BC-albedo reduction to cause about 20% Arctic snow/ice cover reduction and 20% of Arctic warming over the previous century . However, reductions in Arctic soot during the past two decades  have likely reversed that trend . Cryospheric feedbacks and atmospheric dynamical responses in models have an associated poleward shift in the temperature response to aerosol-cloud interactions .	0
Solar spectral  irradiance variations along the solar cycle induce ozone responses by modifying the ozone production rate through photolysis of molecular oxygen , and the resulting differential heating can drive circulation anomalies that lead to regional temperature and precipitation changes . Such solar forcing may influence natural modes of circulation such as the Northern Annular Mode , the South Asian Summer Monsoon , the Southern Annular Mode  or the ENSO . The pattern of temperature response is less uniform than the forcing, for example, warming in the NH, but little response in the SH due to temperature moderation by wind speed enhancement effects on ocean circulation . Regional responses to solar forcing are mediated by the stratosphere, so that reproducing such change requires spectrally varying solar forcing rather than TSI forcing .	0
Albedo changes due to land use and land cover changes exert a heterogeneous climate forcing . The surface albedo brightened on the one hand due to a shift from forest to brighter croplands, causing local cooling , but also darkened due to the re-expansion of forests to higher latitudes  and increased vegetation height in snowy regions . Model studies have shown cooling from land use and land cover changes, especially over NH continents, although without demonstrating a detectable signal in observations . In addition to land use and climate-induced vegetation changes, CO2 affects vegetation forcing indirectly, reducing transpiration from plants as stomata open less with increasing CO2, resulting in localized atmospheric drying and warming . These are not included in the standard RF  and may be considered feedbacks . This is modelled to be largest over the Amazon, the central African forest, and to some extent over boreal and temperate forests . In the coupled climate modelling study of Lawrence and Chase , the vegetation changes caused significant reduction in evapotranspiration, drying and warming in tropical and subtropical regions, with insignificant cooling at higher latitudes. Overall, vegetation changes may have caused modest cooling at high latitudes and warming at low latitudes, but the uncertainties are large and confidence is very low. Deposition of BC on snow and ice, and loss of snow and ice darken the surface, reduces albedo, and enhances climate warming. Substantial snow-cover reduction of North America leads to warmer North American summertime temperature in models having a strong snow	0
Stratospheric aerosol clouds  from tropical eruptions spread poleward and can cover an entire hemisphere or the globe, depending on the initial latitudinal spread. The aerosol eruption cloud from the 1963 Agung was confined mainly to the SH; the 1982 El Chichon mainly to the NH; and the 1991 Pinatubo covered the globe, all with an e-folding lifetime of about 1 year . High-latitude eruptions typically stay confined to the high-latitude regions with shorter lifetimes of 2 to 4 months . Volcanic aerosols primarily scatter solar radiation back to space, but also absorb longwave radiation with the former larger by an order of magnitude. Stratospheric aerosol absorption heats the layer where they reside and produces distinct vertical and horizontal distributions of the heating rate. The temperature and chemical effects of the aerosols also enhance ozone destruction, which somewhat counteracts the radiative heating . For tropical eruptions, this may affect atmospheric dynamics, with a stronger polar vortex, a positive mode of the Arctic Oscillation, and winter warming over NH continents . Climate responses to solar and volcanic forcings are further discussed in the context of detection and attribution of millennial climate change . The study of how climate responds to regionally varying patterns of forcing is critical for understanding how local activities impact regional 707	0
Most components of aerosols and ozone precursors are estimated to decrease toward the end of this century in the RCPs except CH4 in RCP8.5  and nitrate aerosols, though some species reach the maximum amounts of emissions around the mid-21st century . The RCPs therefore contrast with the emission scenarios for TAR and AR4, which were based on Special Report on Emissions Scenarios  and have future projections of larger increase in the near-term climate forcers . It has been questioned whether such low emission of NTCFs is possible in the future given the current policies . This section surveys spatial differences in the RF of aerosols and ozone for the future based on the RCPs. Figure 8.26 shows the global distributions of changes in aerosol and ozone forcings in 2030 and 2100 relative to 2000 for RCP2.6 and 8.5 . Both scenarios indicate reduced aerosol loading, and thus positive forcing over Europe, North America and Asia by 2100 where RF is above +0.5 W m-2 because of substantial reduction of scattering aerosols. The global mean RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction is estimated to be +0.12 and +0.08 W m-2 for RCP2.6 and 8.5, respectively, in 2100. Though the RF by total anthropogenic aerosols is positive, reduced BC contributes substantial negative forcing especially over the similar regions. The global mean carbonaceous RF including both the effects of BC and OC is estimated to be -0.20 and -0.11 W m-2 for RCP2.6 and 8.5, respectively, in 2100. Early in the century, on the other hand, both scenarios indicate increased negative aerosol forcing over South Asia, with reversal between 2030 and 2100. Emissions of BC, OC and SO2 will reach their maximums early and middle in the century for RCP2.6 and 8.5, respectively in India. In RCP6, high emission levels of SO2 in China persist until the mid-21st century , and then it is predicted to keep a high negative RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction over East Asia. The RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction for carbonaceous aerosol is positive over East and South Asia in 2030 relative to 2000 for RCP8.5 because BC emission is also larger in 2030. Over central and southern Africa, a change in the future RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction based on RCPs is not clear mainly because of uncertainties in the wildfires emissions . The global mean total RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction in the future is rather small due to offsetting effects, with reductions in BC, increases in nitrate aerosols, and reductions in scattering aerosols each causing substantially more forcing than the net. Emissions and atmospheric loadings of natural aerosols are affected by climate change. There is, however, no consensus among studies on future trends of their changes for major natural aerosols, mineral dust and sea salt, as indicated in Section 7.3.5.1. The spatial pattern of the aerosol forcing may be influenced by natural aerosols due to reduction	0
in sea ice cover leading to increased emission of high-latitude sea salt  and SOA from vegetation changes . The simulations applying the RCPs indicate that the latitude of maximum emission of NTCFs, and therefore of maximum RF, is projected to shift somewhat southward for the next few decades . The shift of peak aerosol loading southward is expected to cause the ITCZ to continue to shift northward. This, in combination with warming and drying over tropical land, has been modelled to lead to greatly enhanced drought conditions in the Amazon . On the other hand, if the low-latitude aerosol is sufficiently absorbing, broadening of the ITCZ convergence region and enhanced cloud cover could result, as modelled for dust . Reductions in high-latitude BC are expected to contribute to reducing Arctic forcing , due to reduction in BC deposition on snow as well as in absorption of sunlight over bright surface. On the other hand, reduction in mid-high-latitude scattering aerosols may offset all or part of the impact of the local Arctic forcing change . Figure 8.26 also shows the ozone RF in 2030 and 2100 relative to 2000, which includes changes both in tropospheric and stratospheric ozone. Recovery of ozone in the stratosphere in the 21st century will result in positive forcing in the SH high latitudes in comparison with the year 2000 for both the pathways. This is because of the reduced emissions of ozone-depleting substances controlled under the Montreal Protocol, with a small additional effect from a feedback of changes in temperature and in the vertical circulation due to changes in stratospheric compositions . In the troposphere, on the other hand, a large difference in the CH4 emissions between RCP8.5 and the other pathways shown in Figure 8.2 leads to a different RF trend outside the SH high latitudes. Ozone recovery in the stratosphere and ozone increase in the troposphere leads to a positive RF all over the globe in RCP8.5 with a mean of +0.26 W m-2 in 2100. The cancellation between positive RF due to ozone increase in the stratosphere and negative RF due to ozone decrease in the troposphere results in a global mean RF of -0.12 W m-2 in RCP2.6. Figure 8.26 also shows the global distributions of changes in ERF due to both aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions in 2030 and 2100 relative to 2000 for RCP8.5. Although the ERF includes rapid adjustments and therefore its magnitude is much larger than that of RF due to aerosol-radiation interaction, the spatial pattern is generally similar to RF. The ERF in 2100 shows positive values relative to 2000 in North America, Europe and Asia even with RCP8.5, which indicates the aerosol forcing is projected to approach to the pre-industrial level.	0
To quantify and compare the climate impacts of various emissions, it is necessary to choose a climate parameter by which to measure the effects; that is, RF, temperature response, and so forth. Thus, various choices are needed for the steps down the cause-effect chain from emissions to climate change and impacts . Each step in the cause effect chain requires a modelling framework. For assessments and evaluation one may--as an alternative to models that explicitly include physical processes resulting in forcing and responses--apply simpler measures or metrics that are based on results from complex models. Metrics are used to quantify the contributions to climate change of emissions of different substances and can thus act as `exchange rates' in multi-component policies or comparisons of emissions from regions/countries or sources/sectors. Metrics are also used in areas such as Life Cycle Assessments and Integrated Assessment Modelling . Metrics can be given in absolute terms  or in relative terms by normalizing to a reference gas -- usually CO2. To transform the effects of different emissions to a common scale -- often called `CO2 equivalent emissions'--the emission  of component i can be multiplied with the adopted normalized metric : Mi x Ei = CO2-eqi. Ideally, the climate effects of the calculated CO2 equivalent emissions should be the same regardless of the mix of components emitted. However, different components have different physical properties, and a metric that establishes equivalence with regard to one effect cannot guarantee equivalence with regard to other effects and over extended time periods, for example, Lauder et al. , O'Neill , Smith and Wigley , Fuglestvedt et al. .	0
Metrics do not define goals and policy--they are tools that enable evaluation and implementation of multi-component policies . The most appropriate metric will depend on which aspects of climate change are most important to a particular application, and different climate policy goals may lead to different conclusions about what is the most suitable metric with which to implement that policy, for example, Plattner et al. ; Tol et al. . Metrics that have been proposed include physical metrics as well as more comprehensive metrics that account for both physical and economic dimensions . This section provides an assessment that focuses on the scientific aspects and utility of emission metrics. Extending such an assessment to include more policy-oriented aspects of their performance and usage such as simplicity, transparency, continuity, economic implications of usage of one metric over another, and so forth, is not given here as this is beyond the scope of WGI. However, consideration of such aspects is vital for user-assessments. In the following, the focus is on the more well-known Global Warming Potential  and Global Temperature change Potential , though other concepts are also briefly discussed.	0
8.7.1.2 The Global Warming Potential Concept The Global Warming Potential  is defined as the time-integrated RF due to a pulse emission of a given component, relative to a pulse emission of an equal mass of CO2 . The GWP was presented in the First IPCC Assessment , stating `It must be stressed that there is no universally accepted methodology for combining all the relevant factors into a single global warming potential for greenhouse gas emissions. A simple approach has been adopted here to illustrate the difficulties inherent in the concept, ...'. Further, the First IPCC Assessment gave no clear physical interpretation of the GWP.	0
Box 8.4 | Choices Required When Using Emission Metrics Time frames: One can apply a backward-looking  or a forward-looking perspective on the responses to emissions. In the forward-looking case one may use pulses of emissions, sustained emissions or emission scenarios. All choices of emission perturbations are somewhat artificial and idealized, and different choices serve different purposes. One may use the level  or rate of change . Furthermore, the effects of emissions may be estimated at a particular time or be integrated over time up to a chosen time horizon. Alternatively, discounting of future effects may be introduced .	0
Type of effect or end-point: Radiative forcing, temperature change or sea level change, for example, could be examined . Metrics may also include eco/biological or socioeconomic damages. The choice of climate impact parameters is related to which aspects of climate change are considered relevant for interpretation of `dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system' . Spatial dimension for emission and response: Equal-mass emissions of NTCFs from different regions can induce varying global mean climate responses, and the climate response also has a regional component irrespective of the regional variation in emissions. Thus, metrics may be given for region of emission as well as region of response. Some of the choices involved in metrics are scientific . Choices of time frames and climate impact are policy-related and cannot be based on science alone, but scientific studies can be used to analyse different approaches and policy choices.	0
A direct interpretation is that the GWP is an index of the total energy added to the climate system by a component in question relative to that added by CO2. However, the GWP does not lead to equivalence with temperature or other climate variables . Thus, the name `Global Warming Potential' may be somewhat misleading, and `relative cumulative forcing index' would be more appropriate. It can be shown that the GWP is approximately equal to the ratio  of the equilibrium temperature response due to a sustained emission of the species or to the integrated temperature response for a pulse emission . The GWP has become the default metric for transferring emissions of different gases to a common scale; often called `CO2 equivalent emissions' . It has usually been integrated over 20, 100 or 500 years consistent with Houghton et al. . Note, however that Houghton et al. presented these time horizons as `candidates for discussion  should not be considered as having any special significance'. The GWP for a time horizon of 100 years was later adopted as a metric to implement the multi-gas approach embedded in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  and made operational in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The choice of time horizon has a strong effect on the GWP values -- and thus also on the calculated contributions of CO2 equivalent emissions by component, sector or nation. There is no scientific argument for selecting 100 years compared with other choices . The choice of time horizon is a value judgement because it depends	0
Figure 8.28 |  The Absolute Global Warming Potential  is calculated by integrating the RF due to emission pulses over a chosen time horizon; for example, 20 and 100 years . The GWP is the ratio of AGWP for component i over AGWP for the reference gas CO2. The blue hatched field represents the integrated RF from a pulse of CO2, while the green and red fields represent example gases with 1.5 and 13 years lifetimes, respectively.  The Global Temperature change Potential  is based on the temperature response at a selected year after pulse emission of the same gases; e.g., 20 or 100 years . See Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.11 for equations for calculations of GWP and GTP.	0
on the relative weight assigned to effects at different times. Other important choices include the background atmosphere on which the GWP calculations are superimposed, and the way indirect effects and feedbacks are included . For some gases the variation in GWP with time horizon mainly reflects properties of the reference gas, not the gas for which the GWP is calculated. The GWP for NTCFs decreases with increasing time horizon, as GWP is defined with the integrated RF of CO2 in the denominator. As shown in Figure 8.29, after about five decades the development in the GWP for CH4 is almost entirely determined by CO2. However, for longlived gases  the development in GWP is controlled by both the increasing integrals of RF from the long-lived gas and CO2.	0
8.7.1.3 The Global Temperature change Potential Concept Compared to the GWP, the Global Temperature change Potential  goes one step further down the cause-effect chain  and is defined as the change in global mean surface temperature at a chosen point in time in response to an emission pulse--relative to that of CO2. Whereas GWP is integrated in time , GTP is an end-point metric that is based on temperature change for a selected year, t, . Like for the GWP, the impact from CO2 is normally used as reference, hence, for a component i, GTPi = AGTPi / AGTPCO2 = Ti /TCO2, where AGTP is the absolute GTP giving temperature change per unit emission . Shine et al.  presented the GTP for both pulse and sustained emission changes based on an energy balance model as well as analytical equations. A modification was later introduced  in which the time horizon is determined by the proximity to a target year as calculated by using scenarios and climate models . Like GWP, the GTP values can be used for weighting the emissions to obtain `CO2 equivalents' . This gives the 712	0
By accounting for the climate sensitivity and the exchange of heat between the atmosphere and the ocean, the GTP includes physical processes that the GWP does not. The GTP accounts for the slow response of the  ocean, thereby prolonging the response to emissions beyond what is controlled by the decay time of the atmospheric concentration. Thus the GTP includes both the atmospheric adjustment time scale of the component considered and the response time scale of the climate system. The GWP and GTP are fundamentally different by construction and different numerical values can be expected. In particular, the GWPs for NTCFs, over the same time frames, are higher than GTPs due to the integrative nature of the metric. The GTP values can be significantly affected by assumptions about the climate sensitivity and heat uptake by the ocean. Thus, the relative uncertainty ranges are wider for the GTP compared to GWP . The additional uncertainty is a typical trade-off when moving along the cause-effect chain to an effect of greater societal relevance . The formulation of the ocean response in the GTP has a substantial effect on the values; thus its characterization also represents a trade-off between simplicity and accuracy. As for GWP, the GTP is also influenced by the background atmosphere, and the way indirect effects and feedbacks are included .	0
8.7.1.4 Uncertainties and Limitations related to Global Warming Potential and Global Temperature change Potential The uncertainty in the numerator of GWP; that is, the AGWPi  is determined by uncertainties in lifetimes  and radiative efficiency. Inclusion of indirect effects increases uncertainties . For the reference gas CO2, the uncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the impulse response function  that describes the development in atmospheric concentration that follows from an emission pulse ; see Box 6.2 and Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.12. The IRF is sensitive to model representation of the carbon cycle, pulse size and background CO2 concentrations and climate. Based on a multi-model study, Joos et al.  estimate uncertainty ranges for the time-integrated IRF for CO2 to be 15% and 25%  for 20- and 100-year time horizons, respectively. Assuming quadratic error propagation, and 10% uncertainty in radiative efficiency, the uncertainty ranges in AGWP for CO2 were estimated to be 18% and 26% for 20 and 100 years. These	0
u ncertainties affect all metrics that use CO2 as reference. Reisinger et al.  and Joos et al.  show that these uncertainties increase with time horizon. The same factors contribute to uncertainties in the GTP, with an additional contribution from the parameters describing the ocean heat uptake and climate sensitivity. In the first presentation of the GTP, Shine et al.  used one time constant for the climate response in their analytical expression. Improved approaches were used by Boucher and Reddy , Collins et al.  and Berntsen and Fuglestvedt  that include more explicit representations of the deep ocean that increased the long-term response to a pulse forcing. Over the range of climate sensitivities from AR4, GTP50 for BC was found to vary by a factor of 2, the CH4 GTP50 varied by about 50%, while for N2O essentially no dependence was found . AGTPs for CO2 were also calculated in the multi-model study by Joos et al. . They found uncertainty ranges in AGTP that are much larger than for AGWP; 45% and 90% for 20 and 100 years . These uncertainty ranges also reflect the signal-tonoise ratio, and not only uncertainty in the physical mechanisms. There are studies combining uncertainties in various input parameters. Reisinger et al.  estimated the uncertainty in the GWP for CH4 and found an uncertainty of -30 to +40% for the GWP100 and -50 to +75% for GTP100 of CH4 . Boucher  performed a Monte Carlo analysis with uncertainties in perturbation lifetime and radiative efficiency, and for GWP100 for CH4  he found 20%, and -40 to +65 for GTP100 . Here we estimate uncertainties in GWP values based on the uncertainties given for radiative efficiencies , perturbation lifetimes, indirect effects and in the AGWP for the reference gas CO2 . For CH4 GWP we estimate an uncertainty of 30% and 40% for 20- and 100-year time horizons, respectively . The uncertainty is dominated by AGWP for CO2 and indirect effects. For gases with lifetimes of a century or more the uncertainties are of the order of 20% and 30% for 20- and 100-year horizons. The uncertainty in GWPs for gases with lifetimes of a few decades is estimated to be of the order of 25% and 35% for 20 and 100 years. For shorter-lived gases, the uncertainties in GWPs will be larger  For GTP, few uncertainty estimates are available in the literature. Based on the results from Joos et al. , Reisinger et al.  and Boucher  we assess the uncertainty to be of the order of 75% for the CH4 GTP100. The metric values are also strongly dependent on which processes are included in the definition of a metric. Ideally all indirect effects  should be taken into account in the calculation of metrics. The indirect effects of CH4 on its own lifetime, tropospheric ozone and stratospheric water have been traditionally included in its GWP. Boucher et al.  have quantified an indirect effect on CO2 when fossil fuel CH4 is oxidized in the atmosphere. Shindell et al.  estimated the impact of reactive species emissions on both gaseous and aerosol forcing species and found that ozone precursors,	0
including CH4, had an additional substantial climate effect because they increased or decreased the rate of oxidation of SO2 to sulphate aerosol. Studies with different sulphur cycle formulations have found lower sensitivity . Collins et al.  postulated an additional component to their GWPs and GTPs for ozone precursors due to the decreased productivity of plants under higher levels of surface ozone. This was estimated to have the same magnitude as the ozone and CH4 effects. This effect, however, has so far only been examined with one model. In a complex and interconnected system, feedbacks can become increasingly complex, and uncertainty of the magnitude and even direction of feedback increases the further one departs from the primary perturbation, resulting in a trade-off between completeness and robustness, and hence utility for decision-making. Gillett and Matthews  included climate-carbon feedbacks in calculations of GWP for CH4 and N2O and found that this increased the values by about 20% for 100 years. For GTP of CH4 they found an increase of ~80%. They used numerical models for their studies and suggest that climate-carbon feedbacks should be considered and parameterized when used in simple models to derive metrics. Collins et al.  parameterize the climate-carbon feedback based on Friedlingstein et al.  and Arora et al.  and find that this more than doubles the GTP100 for CH4. Enhancement of the GTP for CH4 due to carbon-climate feedbacks may also explain the higher GTP values found by Reisinger et al. . The inclusion of indirect effects and feedbacks in metric values has been inconsistent in the IPCC reports. In SAR and TAR, a carbon model without a coupling to a climate model was used for calculation of IRF for CO2 , while in AR4 climate-carbon feedbacks were included for the CO2 IRF . For the time horizons 20 and 100 years, the AGWPCO2 calculated with the Bern3D-LPJ model is, depending on the pulse size, 4 to 5% and 13 to 15% lower, respectively, when carbon cycle-climate feedbacks are not included . While the AGWP for the reference gas CO2 included climate-carbon feedbacks, this is not the case for the non-CO2 gas in the numerator of GWP, as recognized by Gillett and Matthews , Joos et al. , Collins et al.  and Sarofim . This means that the GWPs presented in AR4 may underestimate the relative impacts of non-CO2 gases. The different inclusions of feedbacks partially represent the current state of knowledge, but also reflect inconsistent and ambiguous definitions. In calculations of AGWP for CO2 in AR5 we use the IRF for CO2 from Joos et al.  which includes climate-carbon feedbacks. Metric values in AR5 are presented both with and without including climate-carbon feedbacks for non-CO2 gases. This feedback is based on the carbon-cycle response in a similar set of models  as used for the reference gas . The effect of including this feedback for the non-reference gas increases with time horizon due to the long-lived nature of the initiated CO2 perturbation . The relative importance also increases with decreasing lifetime of the component, and is larger for GTP than GWP due to the integrative nature of GWP. We calculate an increase in the CH4 GWP100 of 20%. For GTP100, however, the changes are much larger; of the order of 160%. For the shorter time horizons  the effect of including this feedback is small  for both GWP 713	0
and GTP. For the more long-lived gases the GWP100 values increase by 10 to 12%, while for GTP100 the increase is 20 to 30%. Table 8.A.1 gives metric values including the climate-carbon feedback for CO2 only, while Supplementary Material Table 8.SM.16 gives values for all halocarbons that include the climate-carbon feedback. Though uncertainties in the carbon cycle are substantial, it is likely that including the climate-carbon feedback for non-CO2 gases as well as for CO2 provides a better estimate of the metric value than including it only for CO2. Emission metrics can be estimated based on a constant or variable background climate and this influences both the adjustment times and the concentration-forcing-temperature relationships. Thus, all metric values will need updating due to changing atmospheric conditions as well as improved input data. In AR5 we define the metric values with respect to a constant present-day condition of concentrations and climate. However, under non-constant background, Joos et al.  found decreasing CO2 AGWP100 for increasing background levels . This means that GWP for all non-CO2 gases  would increase by roughly the same magnitude. Reisinger et al.  found a reduction in AGWP for CO2 of 36% for RCP8.5 from 2000 to 2100 and that the CH4 radiative efficiency and AGWP also decrease with increasing CH4 concentration. Accounting for both effects, the GWP100 for CH4 would increase by 10 to 20% under low and mid-range RCPs by 2100, but would decrease by up to 10% by mid-century under the highest RCP. While these studies have focused on the background levels of GHGs, the same issues apply for temperature. Olivie et al.  find different temperature IRFs depending on the background climate . User related choices  such as the time horizon can greatly affect the numerical values obtained for CO2 equivalents. For a change in time horizon from 20 to 100 years, the GWP for CH4 decreases by a factor of approximately 3 and its GTP by more than a factor of 10. Short-lived species are most sensitive to this choice. Some approaches have removed the time horizon from the metrics , but discounting is usually introduced which means that a discount rate 714	0
8.7.1.5 New Metric Concepts New metric concepts have been developed both to modify physical metrics to address shortcomings as well as to replace them with metrics that account for economic dimensions of problems to which metrics are applied. Modifications to physical metrics have been proposed to better represent CO2 emissions from bioenergy, regional patterns of response, and for peak temperature limits. Emissions of CO2 from the combustion of biomass for energy in national emission inventories are currently assumed to have no net RF, based on the assumption that these emissions are compensated by biomass regrowth . However, there is a time lag between combustion and regrowth, and while the CO2 is resident in the atmosphere it leads to an additional RF. Modifications of the GWP and GTP for bioenergy  have been developed . The GWPbio give values generally between zero  and one  , and negative values are possible for GTPbio due to the fast time scale of atmospheric-ocean CO2 exchange relative to the growth cycle of biomass . GWPbio and GTPbio have been used in only a few applications, and more research is needed to assess their robustness and applicability. Metrics for biogeophysical effects, such as albedo changes, have been proposed  , but as for NTCFs regional variations	0
are important  and the RF concept may not be adequate . New concepts have also been developed to capture information about regional patterns of responses and cancelling effects that are lost when global mean metrics are used. The use of nonlinear damage functions to capture information on the spatial pattern of responses has been explored . In addition, the Absolute Regional Temperature Potential   has been developed to provide estimates of impacts at a sub-global scale. ARTP gives the time-dependent temperature response in four latitude bands as a function of the regional forcing imposed in all bands. These metrics, as well as new regional precipitation metrics , require additional studies to determine their robustness. Alternatives to the single basket approach adopted by the Kyoto Protocol are a component-by-component approach or a multi-basket approach . Smith et al.  show how peak temperature change is constrained by cumulative emissions  for gases with long lifetimes and emissions rates for shorter-lived gases . Thus, they divide gases into two baskets and present two metrics that can be used for estimating peak temperature for various emission scenarios. This division of gases into the two baskets is sensitive to the time of peak temperature in the different scenarios. The approach uses time invariant metrics that do not account for the timing of emissions relative to the target year. The choice of time horizon is implicit in the scenario assumed and this approach works only for a peak scenario. A number of new metrics have been developed to add economic dimensions to purely physically based metrics such as the GWP and GTP. The use of physical metrics in policy contexts has been criticized by economists . A prominent use of metrics is to set relative prices of gases when implementing a multi-gas policy. Once a particular policy has been agreed on, economic metrics can address policy goals more directly than physical metrics by accounting not only for physical dimensions but also for economic dimensions such as mitigation costs, damage costs and discount rates . For example, if mitigation policy is set within a cost-effectiveness framework with the aim of making the least cost mix of emissions reductions across components to meet a global temperature target, the `price ratio' , also called the Global Cost Potential  , most directly addresses the goal. The choice of target is a policy decision; metric values can then be calculated based on an agreed upon target. Similarly, if policy is set within a cost-benefit framework, the metric that directly addresses the policy goal is the ratio of the marginal damages from the emission of a gas  relative to the marginal damages of an emission of CO2, known as the Global Damage Potential  . Both types of metrics are typically determined within an integrated climate- economy model, since they are affected both by the response of the climate system as well as by economic factors.	0
If other indexes, such as the GWP, are used instead of an economic cost-minimizing index, costs to society will increase. Cost implications at the project or country level could be substantial under some circumstances . However, under idealized conditions of full participation in mitigation policy, the increase is relatively small at the global level, particularly when compared to the cost savings resulting from a multi gas mitigation strategy even when based on an imperfect metric . Purely physical metrics continue to be used in many contexts due at least in part to the added uncertainties in mitigation and damage costs, and therefore in the values of economic metrics . Efforts have been made to view purely physical metrics such as GWPs and GTPs as approximations of economic indexes. GTPs, for example, can be interpreted as an approximation of a Global Cost Potential designed for use in a cost-effectiveness setting . Quantitative values for time-dependent GTPs reproduce in broad terms several features of the Global Cost Potential such as the rising value of metrics for short-lived gases as a climate policy target is approached . Figure 8.30 shows how contributions of N2O, CH4 and BC to warming in the target year changes over time. The contributions are given relative to CO2 and show the effects of emission occurring at various times. Similarly, GWPs can be interpreted as approximations of the Global Damage Potential designed for a cost-benefit framework . These interpretations of the GTP and GWP imply that using even a purely physical metric in an economic policy context involves an implicit economic valuation. In both cases, a number of simplifying assumptions must be made for these approximations to hold . For example, in the case of the GWP, the influence of emissions on RF, and therefore implicitly on costs to society, beyond the time horizon is not taken into account, and there are substantial numerical differences between GWP and GDP values . In the case of the GTP, the influence of emissions on temperature change  is	0
included only at the time the target is reached, but not before nor after. Other metrics have been developed to more closely approximate GCPs or GDPs. The Cost-Effective Temperature Potential  reproduces values of the GCP more closely than does the GTP . It is similar to the GTP but accounts for post-target temperature effects based on an assumption about how to value costs beyond the time the target is reached. Metrics have also been proposed that take into account forcing or temperature effects that result from emissions trajectories over broad time spans, and that behave similarly to GCP and GTP  or to GWP .	0
8.7.1.6 Synthesis In the application and evaluation of metrics, it is important to distinguish between two main sources of variation in metric values. While scientific choices of input data have to be made, there are also choices involving value judgements. For some metrics such choices are not always explicit and transparent. The choice of metric type and time horizon will for many components have a much larger effect than improved estimates of input parameters and can have strong effects on perceived impacts of emissions and abatement strategies. In addition to progress in understanding of GWP, new concepts have been introduced or further explored since AR4. Time variant metrics introduce more dynamical views of the temporal contributions that accounts for the proximity to a prescribed target . Time variant metrics can be presented in a format that makes changing metric values over time predictable. As metrics use parameters further down the cause effect chain the metrics become in general more policy relevant, but at the same time the uncertainties increase. Furthermore, metrics that account for regional variations in sensitivity to emissions or regional variation in response could give a very different emphasis to various emissions. Many species, especially NTCFs, produce distinctly regionally heterogeneous RF and climate response patterns. These aspects are not accounted for in the commonly used global scale metrics. The GWPs and GTPs have had inconsistent treatment of indirect effects and feedbacks. The GWPs reported in AR4 include climate-carbon feedbacks for the reference gas CO2 but not for the non-CO2 gases. Such feedbacks may have significant impacts on metrics and should be treated consistently. More studies are needed to assess the importance of consistent treatment of indirect effects/feedbacks in metrics. The weighting of effects over time--choice of time horizon in the case of GWP and GTP--is value based. Discounting is an alternative, which also includes value judgements and is equally controversial. The weighting used in the GWP is a weight equal to one up to the time horizon and zero thereafter, which is not in line with common approaches for evaluation of future effects in economics . Adoption of a fixed horizon of e.g., 20, 100 or 500 years will inevitably put no weight on the long-term effect of CO2 beyond the time horizon . While GWP integrates the effects up to a chosen time horizon the GTP gives the temperature just for one 716	0
chosen year with no weight on years before or after. The most appropriate metric depends on the particular application and which aspect of climate change is considered relevant in a given context. The GWP is not directly related to a temperature limit such as the 2C target , whereas some economic metrics and physical end-point metrics like the GTP may be more suitable for this purpose. To provide metrics that can be useful to the users and policymakers a more effective dialog and discussion on three topics is needed:  which applications particular metrics are meant to serve;  how comprehensive metrics need to be in terms of indirect effects and feedbacks, and economic dimensions; and--related to this  how important it is to have simple and transparent metrics  versus more complex model-based and thus model-dependent metrics. These issues are also important to consider in a wider disciplinary context . Finally, it is important to be aware that all metric choices, even `traditional' or `widely used' metrics, contain implicit value judgements as well as large uncertainties.	0
8.7.2.1 Metrics for Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nitrous Oxide, Halocarbons and Related Compounds Updated GWP and GTP values for CO2, CH4, N2O, CFCs, HCFCs, bromofluorocarbons, halons, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3, and related halogencontaining compounds are given for some illustrative and tentative time horizons in Tables 8.7, 8.A.1 and Supplementary Material Table 8.SM.16. The input data and methods for calculations of GWPs and GTPs are documented in the Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.13. Indirect GWPs that account for the RF caused by depletion of stratospheric ozone  are given for selected gases in Table 8.A.2. The confidence in the ability to provide useful metrics at time scales of several centuries is very low due to nonlinear effects, large uncertainties for multi-century processes and strong assumptions of constant background conditions. Thus, we do not give metric values for longer time scales than 100 years . However, these time scales are important to consider for gases such as CO2, SF6 and PFCs. For CO2, as much as 20 to 40% of the initial increase in concentration remains after 500 years. For PFC14, 99% of an emission is still in the atmosphere after 500 years. The effects of emissions on these time scales are discussed in Chapter 12. The GWP values have changed from previous assessments due to new estimates of lifetimes, impulse response functions and radiative efficiencies. These are updated due to improved knowledge and/or changed background levels. Because CO2 is used as reference, any changes for this gas will affect all metric values via AGWP changes. Figure 8.31 shows how the values of radiative efficiency , integrated impulse response function  and consequentially AGWP for CO2 have changed from earlier assessments relative to AR5 values. The net effect of change in RE and IRF is an increase of approximately 1% and	0
is reduced by one third. Among the hydrofluoroethers  there are also several large changes in lifetimes. In addition, substantial updates of radiative efficiencies are made for several important gases; CFC11, CFC-115, HCFC-124, HCFC-225cb, HFC-143a, HFC-245fa, CCl4, CHCl3, and SF6. The radiative efficiency for carbon tetrachloride  is higher now and the GWP100 has increased by almost 25% from AR4. Uncertainties in metric values are given in Section 8.7.1.4. See also Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.12 and footnote to Table 8.A.1. As can be seen from Table 8.A.2, some ODS have strong indirect effects through stratospheric ozone forcing, which for some of the gases reduce their net GWP100 values substantially . Note that, consistent with Section 8.3.3, the uncertainties are large; 100% for this indirect effect.	0
Figure 8.31 | Changes in the radiative efficiency , integrated impulse response function  and Absolute Global Warming Potential  for CO2 for 100 years from earlier IPCC Assessment Reports normalized relative to the values given in AR5. The `original' values are calculated based on the methods explained or value reported in each IPCC Assessment Report. The `updated' values are calculated based on the methods used in AR5, but the input values from each Assessment Report. The difference is primarily in the formula for the RE, which was updated in TAR. The different integrated IRF in TAR relates to a different parameterisation of the same IRF . Changes represent both changes in scientific understanding and a changing background atmospheric CO2 concentration . The lines connecting individual points are meant as a visual guide and not to represent the values between different Assessment Reports.	0
6% from AR4 to AR5 in AGWP for CO2 for 20 and 100 years, respectively . These increases in the AGWP of the reference gas lead to corresponding decreases in the GWPs for all non-CO2 gases. Continued increases in the atmospheric levels of CO2 will lead to further changes in GWPs  in the future. To understand the factors contributing to changes relative to AR4, comparisons are made here using the AR5 values that include climate- carbon feedbacks for CO2 only. Relative to AR4 the CH4 AGWP has changed due to changes in perturbation lifetime, a minor change in RE due to an increase in background concentration, and changes in the estimates of indirect effects. The indirect effects on O3 and stratospheric H2O are accounted for by increasing the effect of CH4 by 50% and 15%, respectively . The ozone effect has doubled since AR4 taking into account more recent studies as detailed in Sections 8.3.3 and 8.5.1. Together with the changes in AGWP for CO2 the net effect is increased GWP values of CH4. The GWPs for N2O are lower here compared to AR4. A longer perturbation lifetime is used in AR5, while the radiative efficiency is lower due to increased abundances of CH4 and N2O. In addition, the reduction in CH4 via stratospheric O3, UV fluxes and OH levels due to increased N2O abundance is included in GWPs and GTP. Owing to large uncertainties related to altitude of changes, we do not include the RF from stratospheric ozone changes as an indirect effect of N2O. Lifetimes for most of the halocarbons are taken from WMO  and many of these have changed from AR4. The lifetimes of CFC-114, CFC115 and HCF-161 are reduced by approximately 40%, while HFC-152	0
Metric values for NOX usually include the short-lived ozone effect, CH4 changes and the CH4-controlled O3 response. NOX also causes RF through nitrate formation, and via CH4 it affects stratospheric H2O and through ozone it influences CO2. In addition, NOx affects CO2 through nitrogen deposition . Due to high reactivity and the many nonlinear chemical interactions operating on different time scales, as well as heterogeneous emission patterns, calculation of net climate effects of NOX is difficult. The net effect is a balance of large opposing effects with very different temporal behaviours. There is also a large spread in values among the regions due to variations in chemical and physical characteristics of the atmosphere. As shown in Table 8.A.3 the GTP and GWP values are very different. This is due to the fundamentally different nature of these two metrics  and the way they capture the temporal behaviour of responses to NOx emissions. Time variation of GTP for NOX is complex, which is not directly seen by the somewhat arbitrary choices of time horizon, and the net GTP is a fine balance between the contributing terms. The general pattern for NOX is that the short-lived ozone forcing is always positive, while the CH4-induced ozone forcing and CH4 forcing are always negative . Nitrate aerosols from NOx emission are not included in Table 8.A.3. For the GTP, all estimates for NOX from surface sources give a negative net effect. As discussed in Section 8.7.1.4 Collins et al.  and Shindell et al.  implemented further indirect effects, but these are not included in Table 717	0
Emissions of carbon monoxide  and volatile organic compounds  lead to production of ozone on short time scales. By affecting OH and thereby the levels of CH4 they also initiate a positive long-term ozone effect. With its lifetime of 2 to 3 months, the effect of CO emissions is less dependent on location than is the case for NOX . There is also less variation across models. However, Collins et al.  found that inclusion of vegetation effects of O3 increased the GTP values for CO by 20 to 50%. By including aerosol responses Shindell et al.  found an increase in GWP100 by a factor of ~2.5. CO of fossil origin will also have a forcing effect by contributing to CO2 levels. This effect adds 1.4 to 1.6 to the GWP100 for CO .  VOC is not a well-defined group of hydrocarbons. This group of gases with different lifetimes is treated differently across models by lumping or using representative key species. However, the spread in metric values in Table 8.A.5 is moderate across regions, with highest values for emissions in South Asia . The effects via ozone and CH4 cause warming, and the additional effects via interactions with aerosols and via the O3-CO2 link increase the warming effect further. Thus, the net effects of CO and VOC are less uncertain than for NOX for which the net is a residual between larger terms of opposite sign. However, the formation of SOAs is usually not included in metric calculations for VOC, which introduces a cooling effect and increased uncertainty. 8.7.2.2.3	0
Most of the metric values for BC in the literature include the aerosol-radiation interaction and the snow/ice albedo effect of BC, though whether external or internal mixing is used varies between the studies. Bond et al.  calculate GWPs and find that when the albedo effect is included the values increase by 5 to 15%. Studies have shown, however, that the climate response per unit forcing to this mechanism is stronger than for WMGHG . Bond et al.  assessed the current understanding of BC effects and calculated GWP and GTP for BC that includes aerosol-radiation interaction, aerosol-cloud interactions and albedo. As shown in Table 8.A.6 the uncertainties are wide for both metrics  reflecting the current challenges related to understanding and quantifying the various effects . Their aerosol-radiation interaction effect is about 65% of the total effect while the albedo effect is approximately 20% of the aerosol- radiation interaction effect. Based on two studies , the GWP and GTP metrics were found to vary with 718	0
the region where BC is emitted by about 30% . For larger regions of emissions, Collins et al.  calculated GWPs and GTPs for the direct effect of BC and found somewhat lower variations among the regions. Several studies have focused on the effects of emissions of BC and OC from different regions . However, examination of results from these models  reveals that there is not a robust relationship between the region of emission and the metric value -- hence, regions that yield the highest metric value in one study, do not, in general, do so in the other studies. The metric values for OC are quite consistent across studies, but fewer studies are available . A brief overview of metric values for other components is given in the Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.14. 8.7.2.2.4	0
The metrics provide a format for comparing the magnitudes of the various emissions as well as for comparing effects of emissions from different regions. They can also be used for comparing results from different studies. Much of the spread in results is due to differences in experimental design and how the models treat physical and chemical processes. Unlike most of the WMGHGs, many of the NTCFs are tightly coupled to the hydrologic cycle and atmospheric chemistry, leading to a much larger spread in results as these are highly complex processes that are difficult to validate on the requisite small spatial and short temporal scales. The confidence level is lower for many of the NTCF compared to WMGHG and much lower where aerosol-cloud interactions are important . There are particular difficulties for NOX, because the net impact is a small residual of opposing effects with quite different spatial distributions and temporal behaviour. Although climate-carbon feedbacks for non-CO2 emissions have not been included in the NTCF metrics  presented here, they can greatly increase those values  and likely provide more realistic results.	0
8.7.2.3 Impact by Emitted Component We now use the metrics evaluated here to estimate climate impacts of various components . Figure 8.32 shows global anthropogenic emissions of some selected components weighted by the GWP and GTP. The time horizons are chosen as examples and illustrate how the perceived impacts of components--relative to the impact of the reference gas--vary strongly as function of impact parameter  and with time horizon. We may also calculate the temporal development of the temperature responses to pulse or sustained emissions using the AGTP metric. Figure 8.33 shows that for a one-year pulse the impacts of NTCF decay quickly owing to their atmospheric adjustment times even if effects are prolonged due to climate response time (in the case of constant emissions the effects reach approximately constant levels since the emissions are replenished each year, except for CO2, which has a fraction	0
8.7.2.4 Metrics and Impacts by Sector While the emissions of WMGHGs vary strongly between sectors, the climate impacts of these gases are independent of sector. The latter is not the case for chemically active and short-lived components, due to the dependence of their impact on the emission location. Since most sectors have multiple co-emissions, and for NTCFs some of these are warming while others are cooling, the net impact of a given sector requires explicit calculations. Since AR4, there has been significant progress in the understanding and quantification of climate impacts of NTCFs from sectors such as transportation, power production and biomass burning . Supplementary Material Table 8.SM.18 gives an overview of recent published metric values for various components by sector. The impact from sectors depends on choice of metric, time horizon, pulse versus sustained emissions and forward versus backward looking perspective . Unger et al.  calculated RF for a set of components emitted from each sector. RF at chosen points in time  for sustained emissions was used by Unger et al.  as the metric for comparison. This is comparable	0
to using integrated RF up to the chosen times for pulse emissions . Such studies are relevant for policymaking that focuses on regulating the total activity of a sector or for understanding the contribution from a sector to climate change. On the other hand, the fixed mix of emissions makes it less general and relevant for emission scenarios. Alternatively, one may adopt a component-by-component view which is relevant for policies directed towards specific components . But this view will not capture interactions and non-linearities within the suite of components emitted by most sectors. The effects of specific emission control technologies or policies or projected societal changes on the mix of emissions is probably the most relevant type of analysis, but there are an enormous number of possible actions and regional details that could be investigated. Henze et al.  demonstrate a method for providing highly spatially resolved 719	0
Metrics for individual land-based sectors are often similar to the global mean metric values . In contrast, metrics for emissions from aviation and shipping usually show large differences from global mean metric values . Though there can sometimes be substantial variation in the impact of landbased sectors across regions, and for a particular region even from one sector to another, variability between different land-based sources is generally smaller than between land, sea and air emissions. NOx from aviation is one example where the metric type is especially important. GWP20 values are positive due to the strong response of short-lived ozone. Reported GWP100 and GTP100 values are of either sign, however, due to the differences in balance between the individual effects modelled. Even if the models agree on the net effect of NOX, the individual contributions can differ significantly, with large uncertainties stemming from the relative magnitudes of the CH4 and O3 responses  and the background tropospheric concentrations of NOX . Kohler et al. , find strong regional sensitivity of ozone and CH4 to NOX particularly at cruise altitude. Generally, they find the strongest effects at low latitudes. For the aviation sector contrails and contrail induced cirrus are also important. Based on detailed studies in the literature, Fuglestvedt et al.  produced GWP and GTP for contrails, water vapor and contrail-induced cirrus.	0
in terms of temperature change. The AGTP concept can be used to study the effects of the various components for chosen time horizons. A single year's worth of current global emissions from the energy and industrial sectors have the largest contributions to warming after 100 years . Household fossil fuel and biofuel, biomass burning and on-road transportation are also relatively large contributors to warming over 100-year time scales. Those same sectors, along with sectors that emit large amounts of CH4 , are most important over shorter time horizons . Analysing climate change impacts by using the net effect of particular activities or sectors may--compared to other perspectives--provide more insight into how societal actions influence climate. Owing to large variations in mix of short- and long-lived components, as well as cooling and warming effects, the results will also in these cases depend strongly on choice of time horizon and climate impact parameter. Improved understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions, and how those are attributed to individual components is clearly necessary to refine estimates of sectoral or emitted component impacts. 	0
The GWP and GTPs for NOX from shipping are strongly negative for all time horizons. The strong positive effect via O3 due to the low-NOX environment into which ships generally emit NOX is outweighed by the stronger effect on CH4 destruction due to the relatively lower latitudes of these emissions compared to land-based sources. In addition to having large emissions of NOX the shipping sector has large emission of SO2. The direct GWP100 for shipping ranges from -11 to -43 . Lauer et al.  reported detailed calculations of the indirect forcing specifically for this sector and found a wide spread of values depending on the emission inventory. Righi et al.  and Peters et al.  calculate indirect effects that are 30 to 50% lower than the indirect forcing reported by Lauer et al. . The values from Shindell and Faluvegi  for SO2 from power generation are similar to those for shipping. Although the various land transport sectors often are treated as one aggregate  there are important subdivisions. For instance, Bond et al.  points out that among the BC-rich sectors they examined, diesel vehicles have the most clearly positive net impact on forcing. Studies delving even further have shown substantial differences between trucks and cars, gasoline and diesel vehicles, and low-sulphur versus high-sulphur fuels. Similarly, for power production there are important differences depending on fuel type . In the assessment of climate impacts of current emissions by sectors we give examples and apply a forward-looking perspective on effects 720	0
Metric values for CH4 of fossil origin include the oxidation to CO2 . In applications of these values, inclusion of the CO2 effect of fossil methane must be done with caution to avoid any double-counting because CO2 emissions numbers are often based on total carbon content. Methane values without the CO2 effect from fossil methane are thus appropriate for fossil methane sources for which the carbon has been accounted for elsewhere, or for biospheric methane sources for which there is abalance between CO2 taken up by the biosphere and CO2 produced from CH4 oxidization. The addition effect on GWP and GTP represents lower limits from Boucher et al.  and assume 50% of the carbon is deposited as formaldehyde to the surface and is then lost. The upper limit in Boucher et al.  made the assumption that this deposited formaldehyde was subsequently further oxidized to CO2 .	0
Executive Summary Climate models have continued to be developed and improved since the AR4, and many models have been extended into Earth System models by including the representation of biogeochemical cycles important to climate change. These models allow for policy-relevant calculations such as the carbon dioxide  emissions compatible with a specified climate stabilization target. In addition, the range of climate variables and processes that have been evaluated has greatly expanded, and differences between models and observations are increasingly quantified using `performance metrics'. In this chapter, model evaluation covers simulation of the mean climate, of historical climate change, of variability on multiple time scales and of regional modes of variability. This evaluation is based on recent internationally coordinated model experiments, including simulations of historic and paleo climate, specialized experiments designed to provide insight into key climate processes and feedbacks and regional climate downscaling. Figure 9.44 provides an overview of model capabilities as assessed in this chapter, including improvements, or lack thereof, relative to models assessed in the AR4. The chapter concludes with an assessment of recent work connecting model performance to the detection and attribution of climate change as well as to future projections. There is very high confidence that models reproduce the general features of the global-scale annual mean surface temperature increase over the historical period, including the more rapid warming in the second half of the 20th century, and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions. Most simulations of the historical period do not reproduce the observed reduction in global mean surface warming trend over the last 10 to 15 years. There is medium confidence that the trend difference between models and observations during 1998-2012 is to a substantial degree caused by	0
Current climate models reproduce the seasonal cycle of Arctic sea ice extent with a multi-model mean error of less than about 10% for any given month. There is robust evidence that the downward trend in Arctic summer sea ice extent is better simulated than at the time of the AR4, with about one quarter of the simulations showing a trend as strong as, or stronger, than in observations over the satellite era . There is a tendency for models to slightly overestimate sea ice extent in the Arctic  in winter and spring. In the Antarctic, the multi-model mean seasonal cycle agrees well with observations, but inter-model spread is roughly double that for the Arctic. Most models simulate a small decreasing trend in Antarctic sea ice extent, albeit with large inter-model spread, in contrast to the small increasing trend in observations. 	0
Models are able to reproduce many features of the observed global and Northern Hemispher  mean temperature variance on interannual to centennial time scales , and most models are now able to reproduce the observed peak in variability associated with the El Nino  in the Tropical Pacific. The ability to assess variability from millennial simulations is new since the AR4 and allows quantitative evaluation of model estimates of low-frequency climate variability. This is important when using climate models to separate signal and noise in detection and attribution studies . There has been substantial progress since the AR4 in the assessment of model simulations of extreme events. Based on assessment of a suite of indices, the inter-model range of simulated climate extremes is similar to the spread amongst observationally based estimates in most regions. In addition, changes in the frequency of extreme warm and cold days and nights over the second half of the 20th century are consistent between models and observations, with the ensemble global mean time series generally falling within the range of observational estimates. The majority of models underestimate the sensitivity of extreme precipitation to temperature variability or trends, especially in the tropics, which implies that models may underestimate the projected increase in extreme precipitation in the future. Some high-resolution atmospheric models have been shown to reproduce observed year-to-year variability of Atlantic hurricane counts when forced with 744	0
observed sea surface temperatures, though so far only a few studies of this kind are available. Earth system Models of Intermediate Complexity  provide simulations of millennial time-scale climate change, and are used as tools to interpret and expand upon the results of more comprehensive models. Although they are limited in the scope and resolution of information provided, EMIC simulations of global mean surface temperature, ocean heat content and carbon cycle response over the 20th century are consistent with the historical records and with more comprehensive models, suggesting that they can be used to provide calibrated projections of long-term transient climate response	0
Climate and Earth System models are based on physical principles, and they reproduce many important aspects of observed climate. Both aspects contribute to our confidence in the models' suitability for their application in detection and attribution studies  and for quantitative future predictions and projections . In general, there is no direct means of translating quantitative measures of past performance into confident statements about fidelity of future climate projections. However, there is increasing evidence that some aspects of observed variability or trends are well correlated with inter-model differences in model projections for quantities such as Arctic summertime sea ice trends, snow albedo feedback, and the carbon loss from tropical land. These relationships provide a way, in principle, to transform an observable quantity into a constraint on future projections, but the application of such constraints remains an area of emerging research. There has been substantial progress since the AR4 in the methodology to assess the reliability of a multi-model ensemble, and various approaches to improve the precision of multi-model projections are being explored. However, there is still no universal strategy for weighting the projections from different models based on their historical performance. 	0
Climate models are the primary tools available for investigating the response of the climate system to various forcings, for making climate predictions on seasonal to decadal time scales and for making projections of future climate over the coming century and beyond. It is crucial therefore to evaluate the performance of these models, both individually and collectively. The focus of this chapter is primarily on the models whose results will be used in the detection and attribution Chapter 10 and the chapters that present and assess projections , and so this is necessarily an incomplete evaluation. In particular, this chapter draws heavily on model results collected as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects  , as these constitute a set of coordinated and thus consistent and increasingly well-documented climate model experiments. Other intercomparison efforts, such as those dealing with Regional Climate Models  and those dealing with Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity  are also used. It should be noted that the CMIP3 model archive has been extensively evaluated, and much of that evaluation has taken place subsequent to the AR4. By comparison, the CMIP5 models are only now being evaluated and so there is less published literature available. Where possible we show results from both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models so as to illustrate changes in model performance over time; however, where only CMIP3 results are available, they still constitute a useful evaluation of model performance in that for many quantities, the CMIP3 and CMIP5 model performances are broadly similar.	0
Applications include simulating palaeo or historical climate, sensitivity and process studies for attribution and physical understanding, predicting near-term climate variability and change on seasonal to decadal time scales, making projections of future climate change over the coming century or more and downscaling such projections to provide more detail at the regional and local scale. Computational cost is a factor in all of these, and so simplified models  can be used when larger ensembles or longer integrations are required. Examples include exploration of parameter sensitivity or simulations of climate change on the millennial or longer time scale. Here, we provide a brief overview of the climate models evaluated in this chapter.	0
9.1.2.1 Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models  were the `standard' climate models assessed in the AR4. Their primary function is to understand the dynamics of the physical components of the climate system , and for making projections based on future greenhouse gas  and aerosol forcing. These models continue to be extensively used, and in particular are run  for seasonal to decadal climate prediction applications in which biogeochemical feedbacks are not critical . In addition, high-resolution or variable-resolution AOGCMs are often used in process studies or applications with a focus on a particular region. An overview of the AOGCMs assessed in this chapter can be found in Table 9.1 and the details in Table 9.A.1. For some specific applications, an atmospheric component of such a model is used on its own.	0
The direct approach to model evaluation is to compare model output with observations and analyze the resulting difference. This requires knowledge of the errors and uncertainties in the observations, which have been discussed in Chapters 2 through 6. Where possible, averages over the same time period in both models and observations are compared, although for many quantities the observational record is rather short, or only observationally based estimates of the climatological mean are available. In cases where observations are lacking, we resort to intercomparison of model results to provide at least some quantification of model uncertainty via inter-model spread.	0
EMICs attempt to include relevant components of the Earth system, but often in an idealized manner or at lower resolution than the models described above. These models are applied to certain scientific questions such as understanding climate feedbacks on millennial time scales or exploring sensitivities in which long model integrations or large ensembles are required . This class of models often includes Earth system components not yet included in all ESMs . As computing power increases, this model class has continued to advance in terms of resolution and complexity. An overview of EMICs assessed in this chapter and in the AR5 WG1 is provided in Table 9.2 with additional details in Table 9.A.2.	0
Table 9.1 | Main features of the Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models  and Earth System Models  participating in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 , and a comparison with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 , including components and resolution of the atmosphere and the ocean models. Detailed CMIP5 model description can be found in Table 9.A.1 . Official CMIP model names are used. HT stands for High-Top atmosphere, which has a fully resolved stratosphere with a model top above the stratopause. AMIP stands for models with atmosphere and land surface only, using observed sea surface temperature and sea ice extent. A component is coloured when it includes at least a physically based prognostic equation and at least a two-way coupling with another component, allowing climate feedbacks. For aerosols, lighter shading means `semi-interactive' and darker shading means `fully interactive'. The resolution of the land surface usually follows that of the atmosphere, and the resolution of the sea ice follows that of the ocean. In moving from CMIP3 to CMIP5, note the increased complexity and resolution as well as the absence of artificial flux correction  used in some CMIP3 models.	0
Atmospheric models must parameterize a wide range of processes, including those associated with atmospheric convection and clouds, cloud-microphysical and aerosol processes and their interaction, boundary layer processes, as well as radiation and the treatment of unresolved gravity waves. Advances made in the representation of cloud processes, including aerosol-cloud and cloud-radiation interactions, and atmospheric convection are described in Sections 7.2.3 and 7.4. Improvements in representing the atmospheric boundary layer since the AR4 have focussed on basic boundary layer processes, the representation of the stable boundary layer, and boundary layer clouds . Several global models have successfully adopted new approaches to the parameterization of shallow cumulus convection and moist boundary layer turbulence that acknowledge their	0
Box 9.1 | Climate Model Development and Tuning The Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models, Earth System Models and Regional Climate Models evaluated here are based on fundamental laws of nature . The development of climate models involves several principal steps: 1. Expressing the system's physical laws in mathematical terms. This requires theoretical and observational work in deriving and simplifying mathematical expressions that best describe the system. 2. Implementing these mathematical expressions on a computer. This requires developing numerical methods that allow the solution of the discretized mathematical expressions, usually implemented on some form of grid such as the latitude-longitude-height grid for atmospheric or oceanic models.	0
3. Building and implementing conceptual models  for those processes that cannot be represented explicitly, either because of their complexity  or because the spatial and/or temporal scales on which they occur are not resolved by the discretized model equations . The development of parameterizations has become very complex  and is often achieved by developing conceptual models of the process of interest in isolation using observations and comprehensive process models. The complexity of each process representation is constrained by observations, computational resources and current knowledge . The application of state-of-the-art climate models requires significant supercomputing resources. Limitations in those resources lead to additional constraints. Even when using the most powerful computers, compromises need to be made in three main areas: 1. Numerical implementations allow for a choice of grid spacing and time step, usually referred to as `model resolution'. Higher model resolution generally leads to mathematically more accurate models  but also to higher computational costs. The finite resolution of climate models implies that the effects of certain processes must be represented through parameterizations . 2. The climate system contains many processes, the relative importance of which varies with the time scale of interest . Hence compromises to include or exclude certain processes or components in a model must be made, recognizing that an increase in complexity generally leads to an increase in computational cost . 3. Owing to uncertainties in the model formulation and the initial state, any individual simulation represents only one of the possible pathways the climate system might follow. To allow some evaluation of these uncertainties, it is necessary to carry out a number of simulations either with several models or by using an ensemble of simulations with a single model, both of which increase computational cost. Trade-offs amongst the various considerations outlined above are guided by the intended model application and lead to the several classes of models introduced in Section 9.1.2. Individual model components  are typically first evaluated in isolation as part of the model development process. For instance, the atmospheric component can be evaluated by prescribing sea surface temperature   or the ocean and land components by prescribing atmospheric conditions . Subsequently, the various components are assembled into a comprehensive model, which then undergoes a systematic evaluation. At this stage, a small subset of model parameters remains to be adjusted so that the model adheres to large-scale observational constraints . This final parameter adjustment procedure is usually referred to as `model tuning'. Model tuning aims to match observed climate system behaviour and so is connected to judgements as to what constitutes a skilful representation of the Earth's climate. For instance, maintaining the global mean top of the atmosphere  energy balance in a simulation of pre-industrial climate is essential to prevent the climate system from drifting to an unrealistic state. The models used in this report almost universally contain adjustments to parameters in their treatment of clouds to fulfil this important constraint of the climate system . With very few exceptions  modelling centres do not routinely describe in detail how they tune their models. Therefore the complete list of observational constraints toward which a particular model is tuned is generally not 	0
available. However, it is clear that tuning involves trade-offs; this keeps the number of constraints that can be used small and usually focuses on global mean measures related to budgets of energy, mass and momentum. It has been shown for at least one model that the tuning process does not necessarily lead to a single, unique set of parameters for a given model, but that different combinations of parameters can yield equally plausible models . Hence the need for model tuning may increase model uncertainty. There have been recent efforts to develop systematic parameter optimization methods, but owing to model complexity they cannot yet be applied to fully coupled climate models . Model tuning directly influences the evaluation of climate models, as the quantities that are tuned cannot be used in model evaluation. Quantities closely related to those tuned will provide only weak tests of model performance. Nonetheless, by focusing on those quantities not generally involved in model tuning while discounting metrics clearly related to it, it is possible to gain insight into model performance. Model quality is tested most rigorously through the concurrent use of many model quantities, evaluation techniques, and performance metrics that together cover a wide range of emergent  model behaviour.	0
close mutual coupling. One new development is the Eddy-Diffusivity-Mass-Flux  approach . The EDMF approach, like the shallow cumulus scheme of Park and Bretherton , determines the cumulus-base mass flux from the statistical distribution of boundary layer updraft properties, a conceptual advance over the ad hoc closure assumptions used in the past. Realistic treatment of the stable boundary layer remains difficult  with implications for modelling of the diurnal cycle of temperature even under clear skies . Parameterizations of unresolved orographic and non-orographic gravity-wave drag  have seen only a few changes since the AR4 . In addition to new formulations, the estimation of the parameters used in the GWD schemes has recently been advanced through the availability of satellite and groundbased observations of gravity-wave momentum fluxes, high-resolution numerical modelling, and focussed process studies . Evidence from the Numerical Weather Prediction community that important terrain-generated features of the atmospheric circulation are better represented at higher model resolution has recently been confirmed . 9.1.3.1.2	0
2007; Danabasoglu et al., 2008; Ferrari et al., 2008, 2010). Another focus concerns eddy diffusivity, with many CMIP5 models employing flow-dependent schemes. Both of these refinements are important for the mean state and the response to changing forcing, especially in the Southern Ocean . In addition to mesoscale eddies, there has been a growing awareness of the role that sub-mesoscale eddies and fronts play in restratifying the mixed layer , and the parameterization of Fox-Kemper et al.  is now used in some CMIP5 models. There is an active research effort on the representation of dianeutral mixing associated with breaking gravity waves , with this work adding rigour to the prototype energetically consistent abyssal tidal mixing parameterization of Simmons et al.  now used in several climate models . The transport of dense water down-slope by gravity currents  has also been the subject of focussed efforts, with associated parameterizations making their way into some CMIP5 models .	0
Most large-scale sea ice processes, such as basic thermodynamics and dynamics, are well understood and well represented in models . However, important details of sea ice dynamics and deformation are not captured, especially at small scales . Currently, sea ice model development is focussed mainly on  more precise descriptions of physical processes such as microstructure evolution and anisotropy and  including biological and chemical species. Many models now include some representation of sub-grid-scale thickness variations, along with a description of mechanical redistribution that converts thinner ice to thicker ice under deformation . Sea ice albedo has long been recognized as a critical aspect of the global heat balance. The average ice surface albedo on the scale of a climate model grid cell is  the result of a mixture of surface types: bare ice, melting ice, snow-covered ice, open water, etc. Many sea ice models use a relatively simple albedo parameterization that specifies four albedo values: cold snow; warm, melting snow; cold, bare ice; and warm, melting ice, and the specific values may be subject to tuning . Some parameterizations take into account the ice and snow thickness, spectral band and surface melt . Solar radiation may be distributed within the ice column assuming exponential decay or via a more complex multiple-scattering radiative transfer scheme . Snow model development for sea ice has lagged behind terrestrial snow models. Lecomte et al.  introduced vertically varying snow temperature, density and conductivity to improve vertical heat conduction and melting in a 1D model intended for climate simulation, but many physical processes affecting the evolution of the snow pack, such as redistribution by wind, moisture transport  and snow grain size evolution, still are not included in most climate models. Salinity affects the thermodynamic properties of sea ice, and is used in the calculation of fresh water and salt exchanges at the ice-ocean interface . Some models allow the salinity to vary in time , while others assume a salinity profile that is constant . Another new thrust is	0
The omission of internally consistent feedbacks among the physical, chemical and biogeochemical processes in the Earth's climate system is a limitation of AOGCMs. The conceptual issue is that the physical climate influences natural sources and sinks of CO2 and methane , the two most important long-lived GHGs. ESMs incorporate many of the important biogeochemical processes, making it possible to simulate the evolution of these radiatively active species based on their emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources together with their interactions with the rest of the Earth system. Alternatively, when forced with specified concentrations, a model can be used to diagnose these sources with feedbacks included . Given the large natural sources and sinks of CO2 relative to anthropogenic emissions, and given the primacy of CO2 among anthropogenic GHGs, some of the most important enhancements are the addition of terrestrial and oceanic carbon cycles. These cycles have been incorporated into many models  used to make projections of climate change . Several ESMs now include coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles  in order to simulate the interactions of nitrogen compounds with ecosystem productivity, GHGs including nitrous oxide  and ozone , and global carbon sequestration . Oceanic uptake of CO2 is highly variable in space and time, and is determined by the interplay between the biogeochemical and physical processes in the ocean. About half of CMIP5 models make use of schemes that partition marine ecosystems into nutrients, plankton, zooplankton and detritus  while others use a more simplified representation of ocean biogeochemistry . These NPZD-type models allow simulation of some of the important feedbacks between climate and oceanic CO2 uptake, but are limited by the lack of marine ecosystem dynamics. Some efforts have been made to include more plankton groups or plankton functional types in the models  with as-yet uncertain implications for Earth system response. Ocean acidification and the associated decrease in calcification in many marine organisms provides a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 increase . New-generation models therefore include various parameterizations of calcium carbonate  751	0
The treatment of aerosol particles has advanced since the AR4. Many AOGCMs and ESMs now include the basic features of the sulphur cycle and so represent both the direct effect of sulphate aerosol, along with some of the more complex indirect effects involving cloud droplet number and size. Further, several AOGCMs and ESMs are currently capable of simulating the mass, number, size distribution and mixing state of interacting multi-component aerosol particles . The incorporation of more physically complete representations of aerosol often improves the simulated climate under historical and present-day conditions, including the mean pattern and interannual variability in continental rainfall . However, despite the addition of aerosol-cloud interactions to many AOGCMs and ESMs since the AR4, the representation of aerosol particles and their interaction with clouds and radiative transfer remains an important source of uncertainty . Additional aerosol-related topics that have received attention include the connection between dust aerosol and ocean biogeochemistry, the production of oceanic dimethylsulphide , and vegetation interactions with organic atmospheric chemistry . 9.1.3.2.3	0
One of the potentially more significant effects of climate change is the alteration of the distribution, speciation and life cycle of vegetated ecosystems . Vegetation has a significant influence on the surface energy balance, exchanges of non-CO2 GHGs and the terrestrial carbon sink. Systematic shifts in vegetation, for example, northward migration of boreal forests, would therefore impose biogeophysical feedbacks on the physical climate system . In order to include these effects in projections of climate change, several dynamic global vegetation models  have been developed and deployed in ESMs . Although agriculture and managed forests are not yet generally incorporated, DGVMs can simulate the interactions among natural and anthropogenic drivers of global warming, the state of t errestrial 752	0
ecosystems and ecological feedbacks on further climate change. The incorporation of DGVMs has required considerable improvement in the physics of coupled models to produce stable and realistic distributions of flora . The improvements include better treatments of surface, subsurface and soil hydrological processes; the exchange of water with the atmosphere; and the discharge of water into rivers and streams. Whereas the first DGVMs have been coupled primarily to the carbon cycle, the current generation of DGVMs are being extended to include ecological sources and sinks of other non-CO2 trace gases including CH4, N2O, biogenic volatile organic compounds  and nitrogen oxides collectively known as NOx . BVOCs and NOx can alter the lifetime of some GHGs and act as precursors for secondary organic aerosols  and ozone. Disturbance of the natural landscape by fire has significant climatic effects through its impact on vegetation and through its emissions of GHGs, aerosols and aerosol precursors. Because the frequency of wildland fires increases rapidly with increases in ambient temperature , the effects of fires are projected to grow over the 21st century . The interactions of fires with the rest of the climate system are now being introduced into ESMs . 9.1.3.2.5	0
The impacts of land use and land cover change on the environment and climate are explicitly included as part of the Representative Concentration Pathways  used for climate projections to be assessed in later chapters . Several important types of land use and land cover change include effects of agriculture and changing agricultural practices, including the potential for widespread introduction of biofuel crops; the management of forests for preservation, wood harvest and production of woody biofuel stock; and the global trends toward greater urbanization. ESMs include increasingly detailed treatments of crops and their interaction with the landscape , forest management  and the interactions between urban areas and the surrounding climate systems . 9.1.3.2.6	0
Important chemistry-climate interactions such as the impact of the ozone hole and recovery on Southern Hemisphere  climate or the radiative effects of stratospheric water vapour changes on surface temperature have been confirmed in multiple studies . In the majority of the CMIP5 simulations stratospheric ozone is prescribed. The main advance since the AR4 is that time-varying rather than constant stratospheric ozone is now generally used. In addition, several CMIP5 models treat stratospheric chemistry interactively, thus prognostically calculating stratospheric ozone and other chemical constituents. Important chemistry-climate interactions such as an increased influx of stratospheric ozone in a warmer climate that results in higher ozone burdens in the troposphere have also been identified . Ten of the CMIP5 models simulate tropospheric chemistry interactively whereas it is prescribed in the remaining models ).	0
It is now widely accepted that in addition to the influence of tropospheric circulation and climate change on the stratosphere, stratospheric dynamics can in turn influence the tropospheric circulation and its variability . As a result, many climate models now have the ability to include a fully resolved stratosphere with a model top above the stratopause, located at around 50 km. The subset of CMIP5 models with high-top configurations is compared to the set of low-top models with a model top below the stratopause in several studies , although other factors such as differences in tropospheric warming or ozone could affect the two sub-ensembles. 9.1.3.2.7	0
Several features in the coupling between the ocean and the atmosphere have become more widespread since the AR4. The bulk formulae used to compute the turbulent fluxes of heat, water and momentum at the air-sea interface, have been revised. A number of models now consider the ocean surface current when calculating wind stress . The coupling frequency has been increased in some cases to include the diurnal cycle, which was shown to reduce the SST bias in the tropical Pacific . Several models now represent the coupling between the penetration of the solar radiation into the ocean and light-absorbing chlorophyll, with some implications on the representation of the mean climate and climate variability . This coupling is achieved either by prescribing the chlorophyll distribution from observations, or by computing the chlorophyll distribution with an ocean biogeochemical model .	0
substantially due to the trade-off against higher complexity in such models. Since the AR4, typical regional climate model resolution has increased from around 50 km to around 25 km , and the impact of this has been explored with multi-decadal regional simulations . In some cases, RCMs are being run at 10 km resolution or higher . Higher resolution can sometimes lead to a stepwise, rather than incremental, improvement in model performance . For example, ocean models undergo a transition from laminar to eddy-permitting when the computational grid contains more than one or two grid points per first baroclinic Rossby radius  . Such mesoscale eddy-permitting ocean models better capture the large amount of energy contained in fronts, boundary currents, and time dependent eddy features . Models run at such resolution have been used for some climate simulations, though much work remains before they are as mature as the coarser models currently in use . Similarly, atmospheric models with grids that allow the explicit representation of convective cloud systems  avoid employing a parameterization of their effects--a longstanding source of uncertainty in climate models. For example, Kendon et al.  simulated the climate of the UK region over a 20-year period at 1.5 km resolution, and demonstrated several improvements of errors typical of coarser resolution models. Further discussion of this is provided in Section 7.2.2.	0
To understand the cause of model errors it is necessary to evaluate the representation of processes both in the context of the full model and in isolation. A number of evaluation techniques to achieve both process and component isolation have been developed. One involves the so-called `regime-oriented' approach to process evaluation. Instead of averaging model results in time  or space , results are averaged within categories that describe physically distinct regimes of the system. Applications of this approach since the AR4 include the use of circulation regimes , cloud regimes  and thermodynamic states . The application of new observations, such as vertically resolved cloud and water vapour information from satellites  and water isotopes , has also enhanced the ability to evaluate processes in climate models. Another approach involves the isolation of model components or parameterizations in off-line simulations, such as Single Column Models of the atmosphere. Results of such simulations are compared to measurements from field studies or to results of more detailed process models . Numerous process evaluation data sets have been collected since the AR4  and have been applied to the evaluation of climate model processes . These studies are crucial to test the realism of the process formulations that underpin climate models.	0
9.2.1.3 Instrument Simulators Satellites provide nearly global coverage, sampling across many meteorological conditions. This makes them powerful tools for model evaluation. The conventional approach has been to convert satellite-observed radiation information to `model-equivalents' , and these have been used in numerous studies . A challenge is that limitations of the satellite sensors demand various assumptions in order to convert a satellite measurement into a `model equivalent' climate variable. An alternative approach is to calculate `observation-equivalents' from models using radiative transfer calculations to simulate what the satellite would provide if the satellite system were `observing' the model. This approach is usually referred to as an `instrument simulator'. Microphysical assumptions  can be included in the simulators, avoiding inconsistencies.

9.2.1.4 Initial Value Techniques To be able to forecast the weather a few days ahead, knowledge of the present state of the atmosphere is of primary importance. In contrast, climate predictions and projections simulate the statistics of weather seasons to centuries in advance. Despite their differences, both weather predictions and projections of future climate are performed with very similar atmospheric model components. The atmospheric component of climate models can be integrated as a weather prediction model if initialized appropriately . This allows testing parameterized sub-grid scale processes without the complication of feedbacks substantially altering the underlying state of the atmosphere. The application of these techniques since the AR4 has led to some new insights. For example, many of the systematic errors in the modelled climate develop within a few days of simulation, highlighting the important role of fast, parameterized processes . Errors in cloud properties for example were shown to be present within a few days in a forecast in at least some models , although this was not the case in another model . Other studies have highlighted the advantage of such methodologies for the detailed evaluation of model processes using observations that are available only for limited locations and times , an approach that is difficult to apply to long-term climate simulations.	0
9.2.2.2 Perturbed-Parameter Ensembles In contrast, PPEs are created to assess uncertainty based on a single model and benefit from the explicit control on parameter perturbations. This allows statistical methods to determine which parameters are the main drivers of uncertainty across the ensemble . PPEs have been used frequently in simpler models such as EMICs  and are now being applied to more complex models . The disadvantage of PPEs is that they do not explore structural uncertainty, and thus the estimated uncertainty will depend on the underlying model that is perturbed  and may be too narrow . Several studies  recognize the importance of sampling both parametric and structural uncertainty by combining information from both MMEs and PPEs. However, even these approaches cannot account for the effect on uncertainty of systematic errors.	0
9.2.2.3 Statistical Methods Applied to Ensembles The most common approach to characterize MME results is to calculate the arithmetic mean of the individual model results, referred to as an unweighted multi-model mean. This approach of `one vote per model' gives equal weight to each climate model regardless of  how many simulations each model has contributed,  how interdependent the models are or  how well each model has fared in objective evaluation. The multi-model mean will be used often in this chapter. Some climate models share a common lineage and so share common biases . As a result, collections such as the CMIP5 MME cannot be considered a random sample of independent models. This complexity creates challenges for how best to make quantitative inferences of future climate as discussed further in Chapter 12 . Annan and Hargreaves  have proposed a `rank histogram' approach to evaluate model ensembles as a whole, rather than	0
individual models, by diagnosing whether observations can be considered statistically indistinguishable from a model ensemble. Studies based on this approach have suggested that MMEs  are `reliable' in that they are not too narrow or too dispersive as a sample of possible models, but existing single-model-based ensembles tend to be too narrow . Although initial work has analysed the current mean climate state, further work is required to study the relationships between simulation errors and uncertainties in ensembles of future projections . Bayesian methods offer insights into how to account for model inadequacies and combine information from several metrics in both MME and PPE approaches , but they are complex. A simpler strategy of screening out some model variants on the basis of some observational comparison has been used with some PPEs . Edwards et al.  provided a statistical framework for `pre-calibrating' out such poor model variants. Screening techniques have also been used with MMEs . Additional Bayesian methods are applied to the MMEs so that past model performance is combined with prior distributions to estimate uncertainty from the MME . Similar to Bayesian PPE methods, common biases can be assessed within the MME to determine effective independence of the climate models  .	0
This chapter applies a variety of evaluation techniques ranging from visual comparison of observations and the multi-model ensemble and its mean, to application of quantitative performance metrics . No individual evaluation technique or performance measure is considered superior; rather, it is the combined use of many techniques and measures that provides a comprehensive overview of model performance. Although crucial, the evaluation of climate models based on past climate observations has some important limitations. By necessity, it is limited to those variables and phenomena for which observations exist. Table 9.3 provides an overview of the observations used in this chapter. In many cases, the lack or insufficient quality of long-term observations, be it a specific variable, an important processes, or a particular region , and the deep ocean), remains an impediment. In addition, owing to observational uncertainties and the presence of internal variability, the observational record against which models are assessed is `imperfect'. These limitations can be reduced, but not entirely eliminated, through the use of multiple independent observations of the same variable as well as the use of model ensembles. The approach to model evaluation taken in the chapter reflects the need for climate models to represent the observed behaviour of past climate as a necessary condition to be considered a viable tool for future projections. This does not, however, provide an answer to 755	0
Systematic model evaluation requires a coordinated and well-documented suite of model simulations. Organized Model Intercomparison Projects  provide this via standard or benchmark experiments that represent critical tests of a model's ability to simulate the observed climate. When modelling centres perform a common experiment, it offers the possibility to compare their results not just with observations, but with other models as well. This intercomparison enables researchers to explore the range of model behaviours, to isolate the various strengths and weaknesses of different models in a controlled setting, and to interpret, through idealized experiments, the inter-model differences. Benchmark MIP experiments offer a way to distinguish between errors particular to an individual model and those that might be more universal and should become priority targets for model improvement.	0
of these experiments is prescribed as a time series of either global mean concentrations or spatially resolved anthropogenic emissions . The analyses of model performance in this chapter are based on the concentration-based experiments with the exception of the evaluation of the carbon cycle . Most of the model diagnostics are derived from the historical simulations that span the period 1850- 2005. In some cases, these historical simulations are augmented by results from a scenario run, either RCP4.5 or RCP8.5 , so as to facilitate comparison with more recent observations. CMIP5/Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project version 3  simulations for the mid-Holocene and last glacial maximum are used to evaluate model response to palaeoclimatic conditions. Historical emissions-driven simulations are used to evaluate the prognostic carbon cycle. The analysis of global surface temperature variability is based in part on long pre-industrial control runs to facilitate calculation of variability on decadal to centennial time scales. Idealized simulations with 1% per year increases in CO2 are utilized to derive transient climate response. Equilibrium climate sensitivities are derived using results of specialized experiments, with fourfold CO2 increase, designed specifically for this purpose.	0

Pathways . The forcings for the historical simulations evaluated in this section and are described briefly here . In the CMIP3 20th century experiments, the forcings from radiatively active species other than long-lived GHGs and sulphate aerosols were left to the discretion of the individual modelling groups . By contrast, a comprehensive set of historical anthropogenic emissions and land use and land cover change data have been assembled for the CMIP5 experiments in order to produce a relatively homogeneous ensemble of historical simulations with common time series of forcing agents. Emissions of natural aerosols including soil dust, sea salt and volcanic species are still left to the discretion of the individual modelling groups.	0
For AOGCMs without chemical and biogeochemical cycles, the forcing agents are prescribed as a set of concentrations. The concentrations for GHGs and related compounds include CO2, CH4, N2O, all fluorinated gases controlled under the Kyoto Protocol , perfluorocarbons , and sulphur hexafluoride ), and ozone-depleting substances controlled under the Montreal Protocol , hydrochlorofluorocarbons , Halons, carbon tetrachloride , methyl bromide , methyl chloride ). The concentrations for aerosol species include sulphate , ammonium nitrate , hydrophobic and hydrophilic black carbon, hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic carbon, secondary organic aerosols  and four size categories of dust and sea salt. For ESMs that include chemical and biogeochemical cycles, the forcing agents are prescribed both as a set of concentrations and as a set of emissions with provisions to separate the forcing by natural and anthropogenic CO2 . The emissions include time-dependent spatially resolved fluxes of CH4, NOX, CO, NH3, black and organic carbon, and volatile organic compounds . For models that treat the chemical processes associated with biomass burning, emissions of additional species such as C2H4O , C2H5OH , C2H6S  and C3H6O  are also prescribed. Historical land use and land cover change is described in terms of the time-evolving partitioning of land surface area among cropland, pasture, primary land and secondary  land, including the effects of wood harvest and shifting cultivation, as well as land use changes and transitions from/to urban land . These emissions data are aggregated from empirical reconstructions of grassland and forest fires ; international shipping ; aviation , sulphur , black and organic carbon ; and NOX, CO, CH4 and non methane volatile organic compounds   contributed by all other sectors. For the natural forcings a recommended monthly averaged total solar irradiance time series was given, but there was no recommended treatment of volcanic forcing. Both integrated solar irradiance and its spectrum were available, but not all CMIP5 models used the spectral data. The data employed an 1850-2008 reconstruction of the solar cycle and its secular trend using observations of sunspots and faculae, the 10.7 cm solar irradiance measurements and satellite observations .For volcanic forcing CMIP5 models typically employed 760	0
9.3.2.3 Relationship of Decadal and Longer-Term Simulations The CMIP5 archive also includes a new class of decadal-prediction experiments  . The goal is to understand the relative roles of forced changes and internal variability in historical and near-term climate variables, and to assess the predictability that might be realized on decadal time scales. These experiments comprise two sets of hindcast and prediction ensembles with initial conditions spanning 1960 through 2005. The set of 10-year ensembles are initialized starting at 1960 in 1-year increments through the year 2005 while the 30-year ensembles are initialized at 1960, 1980 and 2005. The same physical models are often used for both the short-term and long-term experiments  despite the different initialization of these two sets of simulations. Results from the short-term experiments are described in detail in Chapter 11.	0
9.4.1.1 Temperature and Precipitation Spatial Patterns of the Mean State Surface temperature is perhaps the most routinely examined quantity in atmospheric models. Many processes must be adequately represented in order for a model to realistically capture the observed temperature distribution. The dominant external influence is incoming solar radiation, but many aspects of the simulated climate play an important role in modulating regional temperature such as the presence of clouds and the complex interactions between the atmosphere and the underlying land, ocean, snow, ice and biosphere. The annual mean surface air temperature  is shown in Figure 9.2 for the mean of all available CMIP5 models, and the error, relative to an observationally constrained reanalysis -Interim; Dee et al., 2011) is shown in Figure 9.2. In most areas the multi-model mean agrees with the reanalysis to within 2C, but there are several locations where the biases are much larger, particularly at high elevations over the Himalayas and parts of both Greenland and Antarctica, near the ice edge in the North Atlantic, and over ocean upwelling regions	0
off the west coasts of South America and Africa. Averaging the absolute error of the individual CMIP5 models  yields similar magnitude as the multi-model mean bias , implying that compensating errors across models is limited. The inconsistency across the three available global reanalyses  that have assimilated temperature data at two metres  provides an indication of observational uncertainty. Although the reanalysis inconsistency is smaller than the mean absolute bias in almost all regions, areas where inconsistency is largest  tend to be the same regions where the CMIP5 models show largest mean absolute error. Seasonal performance of models can be evaluated by examining the difference between means for December-January-February  and June-July-August . Figures 9.3 and  show the CMIP5 mean model seasonal cycle amplitude in surface air temperature . The seasonal cycle amplitude is much larger over land where the thermal inertia is much smaller than over the oceans,	0
and it is generally larger at higher latitudes as a result of the larger seasonal amplitude in insolation. Figures 9.3 and  show the mean model bias of the seasonal cycle relative to the ERA-Interim reanalysis . The largest biases correspond to areas of large seasonal amplitude, notably high latitudes over land, but relatively large biases are also evident in some lower latitude regions such as over northern India. Over most land areas the amplitude of the modelled seasonal cycle is larger than observed, whereas over much of the extratropical oceans the modelled amplitude is too small. The simulation of precipitation is a more stringent test for models as it depends heavily on processes that must be parameterized. Challenges are compounded by the link to surface fields  that lead to much greater spatial heterogeneity at regional scales. Figure 9.4 shows the mean precipitation rate simulated by the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble, along with measures of error relative to precipitation analyses from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project . The magnitude of observational uncertainty for precipitation varies with region, which is why many studies make use	0
of several estimates of precipitation. Known large-scale features are reproduced by the multi-model mean, such as a maximum precipitation just north of the equator in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, dry areas over the eastern subtropical ocean basins, and the minimum rainfall in Northern Africa . While many large-scale features of the tropical circulation are reasonably well simulated, there are persistent biases. These include too low precipitation along the equator in the Western Pacific associated with ocean-atmosphere feedbacks maintaining the equatorial cold tongue  and excessive precipitation in tropical convergence zones south of the equator in the Atlantic and the Eastern Pacific . Other errors occurring in several models include an overly zonal orientation of the South-Pacific Convergence Zone  as well as an overestimate of the frequency of occurrence of light rain events . Regional-scale precipitation simulation has strong parameter dependence , and in some models substantial improvements have been shown through increases in resolution  and improved representations of sub-gridscale processes, particularly convection (Neale et al., 762	0
2008). Judged by similarity with the spatial pattern of observations, the overall quality of the simulation of the mean state of precipitation in the CMIP5 ensemble is slightly better than in the CMIP3 ensemble . In summary, there is high confidence that large-scale patterns of surface temperature are well simulated by the CMIP5 models. In certain regions this agreement with observations is limited, particularly at elevations over the Himalayas and parts of both Greenland and Antarctica. The broad-scale features of precipitation as simulated by the CMIP5 models are in modest agreement with observations, but there are systematic errors in the Tropics.	0
Modelling the vertical structure of water vapour is subject to greater uncertainty since the humidity profile is governed by a variety of processes. The CMIP3 models exhibited a significant dry bias of up to 25% in the boundary layer and a significant moist bias in the free troposphere of up to 100% . Upper tropospheric water vapour varied by a factor of three across the multi-model ensemble . Many models have large biases in lower stratospheric water vapour , which could have implications for surface temperature change . The limited number of studies available for the CMIP5 model ensemble broadly confirms the results from the earlier model generation. In tropical regions, the models are too dry in the lower troposphere and too moist in the upper troposphere, whereas in the extratropics they are too moist throughout the troposphere . However, many of the model values lie within the observational uncertainties.	0
The spatial patterns and seasonal cycle of the radiative fluxes at the TOA are fundamental energy balance quantities. Both the CMIP3 and CMIP5 model ensembles reproduce these patterns with considerable fidelity relative to the National Aeronautics and Space Adminsitration  Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System  data sets . Globally averaged TOA shortwave and longwave components of the radiative fluxes in 12 atmosphere-only versions of the CMIP5 models were within 2.5 W m-2 of the observed values . Comparisons against surface components of radiative fluxes show that, on average, the CMIP5 models overestimate the global mean downward all-sky shortwave flux at the surface by 2  6 W m-2  and underestimate the global downward longwave flux by 6  9 W m-2  . Although in tropical regions 763	0
absorbing aerosols, in particular carbonaceous species , or to the omission of weak-line  or continuum  absorption by water vapour . One of the major influences on radiative fluxes in the atmosphere is the presence of clouds and their radiative properties. To measure the influence of clouds on model deficiencies in the TOA radiation budget, Figure 9.5 shows maps of deviations from observations in annual mean shortwave , longwave  and net  cloud radiative effect  for the CMIP5 multi-model mean. The figure  also shows zonal averages of the same quantities from two sets of observations, the individual CMIP5 models, and the multi-model average. The definition of CRE and observed mean fields for these quantities can be found in Chapter 7 . Models show large regional biases in CRE in the shortwave component, and these are particularly pronounced in the subtropics with too weak an effect  of model clouds on shortwave radiation in the stratocumulus regions and too strong an effect  in the trade cumulus regions. This error has been shown to largely result from an overestimation of cloud reflectance, rather than cloud cover . A too weak cloud influence on shortwave radiation is evident over the subpolar oceans of both hemispheres and the Northern Hemisphere  land areas. It is evident in the zonal mean graphs that there is a wide range in both longwave and shortwave CRE between individual models. As is also evident, a significant reduction in the difference between models and observations has resulted from	0
Understanding the biases in CRE in models requires a more in-depth analysis of the biases in cloud properties, including the fractional coverage of clouds, their vertical distribution as well as their liquid water and ice content. Major progress in this area has resulted from both the availability of new observational data sets and improved diagnostic techniques, including the increased use of instrument simulators . Many models have particular difficulties simulating upper tropospheric clouds , and low and mid-level cloud occurrence are frequently underestimated . Global mean values of both simulated ice and liquid water path vary by factors of 2 to 10 between models . The global mean fraction of clouds that can be detected with confidence from satellites ) is underestimated by 5 to 10 % . Some of the above errors in clouds compensate to provide the global mean balance in radiation required by model tuning .	0

Results are shown for individual CMIP3  and CMIP5  models as thin dashes, along with the corresponding ensemble average  and median . The four variables shown are surface air temperature , top of the atmosphere  outgoing longwave radiation , precipitation  and TOA shortwave cloud radiative effect . The observations used for each variable are the default products and climatological periods identified in Table 9.3. The correlations between the default and alternate  observations are also shown . To ensure a fair comparison across a range of model resolutions, the pattern correlations are computed at a resolution of 4 in longitude and 5 in latitude. Only one realization is used from each model from the CMIP3 20C3M and CMIP5 historical simulations.	0
Figure 9.7 | Relative error measures of CMIP5 model performance, based on the global seasonal-cycle climatology  computed from the historical experiments. Rows and columns represent individual variables and models, respectively. The error measure is a space-time root-mean-square error , which, treating each variable separately, is portrayed as a relative error by normalizing the result by the median error of all model results . For example, a value of 0.20 indicates that a model's RMSE is 20% larger than the median CMIP5 error for that variable, whereas a value of -0.20 means the error is 20% smaller than the median error. No colour  indicates that model results are currently unavailable. A diagonal split of a grid square shows the relative error with respect to both the default reference data set  and the alternate . The relative errors are calculated independently for the default and alternate data sets. All reference data used in the diagram are summarized in Table 9.3.	0
et al., 2011; Wahl et al., 2011). Several studies have highlighted the potential importance and poor simulation of subpolar clouds in the Arctic and Southern Oceans . A particular challenge for models is the simulation of the correct phase of the cloud condensate, although very few observations are available to evaluate models particularly with respect to their representation of cloud ice . Regime-oriented approaches to the evaluation of model clouds  have identified that compensating errors in the CRE are largely a result of misrepresentations of the frequency of occurrence of key observed cloud regimes, while the radiative properties of the individual regimes contribute less to the overall model deficiencies . Several studies have identified progress in the simulation of clouds in the CMIP5 models compared to their CMIP3 counterparts. Particular examples include the improved simulation of vertically integrated ice water path  as well as a reduction of overabundant optically thick clouds in the mid-latitudes .	0
9.4.1.3 Quantifying Model Performance with Metrics Performance metrics were used to some extent in the Third Assessment Report  and the Fourth Assessment Report , and are expanded upon here because of their increased appearance in the recent literature. As a simple example, Figure 9.6 illustrates how the pattern correlation between the observed and simulated climatological annual mean spatial patterns depends very much on the quantity examined. All CMIP3 and CMIP5 models capture the mean surface temperature distribution quite well, with correlations above 0.95, which are largely determined by the meridional temperature gradient. Correlations for outgoing longwave radiation are somewhat lower. For precipitation and the TOA shortwave cloud radiative effect, the correlations	0
between models and observations are below 0.90, and there is considerable scatter among model results. This example quantifies how some aspects of the simulated large-scale climate agree with observations better than others. Some of these differences are attributable to smoothly varying fields  often agreeing better with observations than fields that exhibit fine structure  . Incremental improvement in each field is also evident in Figure 9.6, as gauged by the mean and median results in the CMIP5 ensemble having higher correlations than CMIP3. This multi-variate quantification of model improvement across development cycles is evident in several studies  Figure 9.7  depicts the space-time rootmean-square error  for the 1980-2005 climatological seasonal cycle of the historically forced CMIP5 simulations. For each of the fields examined, this `portrait plot' depicts relative performance, with blue shading indicating performance being better, and red shading worse, than the median of all model results. In each case, two observations-based estimates are used to demonstrate the impact of the selection of reference data on the results. Some models consistently compare better with observations than others, some exhibit mixed performance and some stand out with relatively poor agreement with observations. For most fields, the choice of the observational data set does not substantially change the result for global error measures , indicating that inter-model differences are substantially larger than the differences between the two reference data sets or the impact of two different climatological periods  1984-1988; CERES EBAF, 2001-2011). Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that different data sets often rely on the same source of measurements, and that the results in this figure can have some sensitivity to a variety of factors such as instrument uncertainty, sampling errors , the spatial scale of comparison, the domain considered and the choice of metric. Another notable feature of Figure 9.7 is that in most cases the multi-model mean agrees more favourably with observations than any individual model. This has been long recognized to hold for surface temperature and precipitation . However, since the AR4, it has become clear that this holds for a broad range of climatological fields  and is theoretically better understood . It is worth noting that when most models suffer from a common error, such as the cold bias at high latitudes in the upper troposphere , individual models can agree better with observations than the multi-model mean. Correlations between the relative errors for different quantities in Figure 9.7 are known to exist, reflecting physical relationships in the model formulations and in the real world. Cluster analysis methods have recently been used in an attempt to reduce this redundancy , thereby providing more succinct summaries of model performance. Some studies have attempted an overall skill score by averaging together the results from multiple metrics . Although this averaging process is	0
largely arbitrary, combining the results of multiple metrics can reduce the chance that a poorer performing model will score well for the wrong reasons. Recent work  has demonstrated that different methods used to produce a multi-variate skill measure for the CMIP3 models did not substantially alter the conclusions about the better and lesser performing models. Large scale performance metrics are a typical first-step toward quantifying model agreement with observations, and summarizing broad characteristics of model performance that are not focussed on a particular application. More specialized performance tests target aspects of a simulation believed to be especially important for constraining model projections, although to date the connections between particular performance metrics and reliability of future projections are not well established. This important topic is addressed in Section 9.8.3, which highlights several identified relationships between model performance and projection responses.	0
Figure 9.8 compares the observational record of 20th century changes in global surface temperature to that simulated by each CMIP5 and EMIC model and the respective multi-model means. The inset on the right of the figure shows the climatological mean temperature for each model, averaged over the 1961-1990 reference period. Although biases in mean temperature are apparent, there is less confidence in observational estimates of climatological temperature than in variations about this mean . For the CMIP5 models, interannual variability in most of the simulations is qualitatively similar to that observed although there are several exceptions. The magnitude of interannual variations in the observations is noticeably larger than the multi-model mean because the averaging of multiple model results acts to filter much of the simulated variability. On the other hand, the episodic volcanic forcing that is applied to most models  is evident in the multi-model agreement with the observed cooling particularly noticeable after the 1991 Pinatubo eruption. The gradual warming evident in the observational record, particularly in the more recent decades, is also evident in the simulations, with the multi-model mean tracking the observed value closely over most of the century, and individual model results departing by less than about 0.5oC. Because the interpretation of differences in model behaviour can be confounded by internal variability and forcing, some studies have attempted to identify and remove dominant factors such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation  and the impacts of volcanic eruptions . Figure 9.8 shows the similar capability for EMICs to simulate the global-scale response to the 20th century forcings . These 767	0

Box 9.2 | Climate Models and the Hiatus in Global Mean Surface Warming of the Past 15 Years The observed global mean surface temperature  has shown a much smaller increasing linear trend over the past 15 years than over the past 30 to 60 years . Depending on the observational data set, the GMST trend over 1998-2012 is estimated to be around one-third to one-half of the trend over 1951-2012 . For example, in HadCRUT4 the trend is 0.04C per decade over 1998-2012, compared to 0.11C per decade over 1951-2012. The reduction in observed GMST trend is most marked in Northern Hemisphere winter . Even with this "hiatus" in GMST trend, the decade of the 2000s has been the warmest in the instrumental record of GMST . Nevertheless, the occurrence of the hiatus in GMST trend during the past 15 years raises the two related questions of what has caused it and whether climate models are able to reproduce it. Figure 9.8 demonstrates that 15-year-long hiatus periods are common in both the observed and CMIP5 historical GMST time series . However, an analysis of the full suite of CMIP5 historical simulations  reveals that 111 out of 114 realizations show a GMST trend over 1998-2012 that is higher than the entire HadCRUT4 trend ensemble . This difference between simulated and observed trends could be caused by some combination of  internal climate variability,  missing or incorrect radiative forcing and  model response error. These potential sources of the difference, which are not mutually exclusive, are assessed below, as is the cause of the observed GMST trend hiatus.	0
Internal Climate Variability Hiatus periods of 10 to 15 years can arise as a manifestation of internal decadal climate variability, which sometimes enhances and sometimes counteracts the long-term externally forced trend. Internal variability thus diminishes the relevance of trends over periods as short as 10 to 15 years for long-term climate change . Furthermore, the timing of internal decadal climate variability is not expected to be matched by the CMIP5 historical simulations, owing to the predictability horizon of at most 10 to 20 years . However, climate models exhibit individual decades of GMST trend hiatus even during a prolonged phase of energy uptake of the climate system , in which case the energy budget would be balanced by increasing subsurface-ocean heat uptake . Owing to sampling limitations, it is uncertain whether an increase in the rate of subsurface-ocean heat uptake occurred during the past 15 years . However, it is very likely2 that the climate system, including the ocean below 700 m depth, has continued to accumulate energy over the period 1998-2010 . Consistent with this energy accumulation, global mean sea level has continued to rise during 1998-2012, at a rate only slightly and insignificantly lower than during 1993-2012 . The consistency between observed heat-content and sea level changes yields high confidence in the assessment of continued ocean energy accumulation, which is in turn consistent with the positive radiative imbalance of the climate system . By contrast, there is limited evidence that the hiatus in GMST trend has been accompanied by a slower rate of increase in ocean heat content over the depth range 0 to 700 m, when comparing the period 2003-2010 against 1971-2010. There is low agreement on this slowdown, since three of five analyses show a slowdown in the rate of increase while the other two show the increase continuing unabated . During the 15-year period beginning in 1998, the ensemble of HadCRUT4 GMST trends lies below almost all model-simulated trends , whereas during the 15-year period ending in 1998, it lies above 93 out of 114 modelled trends . Over the 62-year period 1951-2012, observed and CMIP5 ensemble-mean trends agree to within 0.02C per decade . There is hence very high confidence that the CMIP5 models show long-term GMST trends consistent with observations, despite the disagreement over the most recent 15-year period. Due to internal climate variability, in any given 15-year period the observed GMST trend sometimes lies near one end of a model ensemble , an effect that is pronounced in Box 9.2, Figure 1a, b because GMST was influenced by a very strong El Nino event in 1998. 	0
Unlike the CMIP5 historical simulations referred to above, some CMIP5 predictions were initialized from the observed climate state during the late 1990s and the early 21st century . There is medium evidence that these initialized predictions show a GMST lower by about 0.05C to 0.1C compared to the historical  simulations and maintain this lower GMST during the first few years of the simulation . In some initialized models this lower GMST occurs in part because they correctly simulate a shift, around 2000, from a positive to a negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation . However, the improvement of this phasing of the IPO through initialization is not universal across the CMIP5 predictions . Moreover, while part of the GMST reduction through initialization indeed results from initializing at the correct phase of internal variability, another part may result from correcting a model bias that was caused by incorrect past forcing or incorrect model response to past forcing, especially in the ocean. The relative magnitudes of these effects are at present unknown ; moreover, the quality of a forecasting system cannot be evaluated from a single prediction . Overall, there is medium confidence that initialization leads to simulations of GMST during 1998-2012 that are more consistent with the observed trend hiatus than are the uninitialized CMIP5 historical simulations, and that the hiatus is in part a consequence of internal variability that is predictable on the multi-year time scale.	0
Radiative Forcing On decadal to interdecadal time scales and under continually increasing effective radiative forcing , the forced component of the GMST trend responds to the ERF trend relatively rapidly and almost linearly . The expected forced-response GMST trend is related to the ERF trend by a factor that has been estimated for the 1% per year CO2 increases in the CMIP5 ensemble as 2.0  W m-2 C-1 . Hence, an ERF trend can be approximately converted to a forced-response GMST trend, permitting an assessment of how much of the change in the GMST trends shown in Box 9.2 Figure 1 is due to a change in ERF trend. The AR5 best-estimate ERF trend over 1998-2011 is 0.22  W m-2 per decade , which is substantially lower than the trend over 1984-1998  W m-2 per decade; note that there was a strong volcanic eruption in 1982) and the trend over 1951-2011  W m-2 per decade; Box 9.2, Figure 1d-f; numbers based on Section 8.5.2, Figure 8.18; the end year 2011 is chosen because data availability is more limited than for GMST). The resulting forced-response GMST trend would approximately be 0.12  C per decade, 0.19  C per decade, and 0.18  C per decade for the periods 1998-2011, 1984-1998 and 1951-2011, respectively . The AR5 best-estimate ERF forcing trend difference between 1998-2011 and 1951-2011 thus might explain about one-half  of the observed GMST trend difference between these periods . The reduction in AR5 best-estimate ERF trend over 1998-2011 compared to both 1984-1998 and 1951-2011 is mostly due to decreasing trends in the natural forcings,-0.16  W m-2 per decade over 1998-2011 compared to 0.01  W m-2 per decade over 1951-2011 . Solar forcing went from a relative maximum in 2000 to a relative minimum in 2009, with a peak-to-peak difference of around 0.15 W m-2 and a linear trend over 1998-2011 of around -0.10 W m-2 per decade . Furthermore, a series of small volcanic eruptions has increased the observed stratospheric aerosol loading after 2000, leading to an additional negative ERF linear-trend contribution of around -0.06 W m-2 per decade over 1998-2011 . By contrast, satellite-derived estimates of tropospheric aerosol optical depth  suggests little overall trend in global mean AOD over the last 10 years, implying little change in ERF due to aerosol-radiative interaction . Moreover, because there is only low confidence in estimates of ERF due to aerosol-cloud interaction , there is likewise low confidence in its trend over the last 15 years. For the periods 1984-1998 and 1951-2011, the CMIP5 ensemble-mean ERF trend deviates from the AR5 best-estimate ERF trend by only 0.01 W m-2 per decade . After 1998, however, some contributions to a decreasing ERF trend are missing in the CMIP5 models, such as the increasing stratospheric aerosol loading after 2000 and the unusually low solar minimum in 2009. Nonetheless, over 1998-2011 the CMIP5 ensemble-mean ERF trend is lower than the AR5 best-estimate ERF trend by 0.03 W m-2 per decade . Furthermore, global mean AOD in the CMIP5 models shows little trend over 1998-2012, similar to the observations . Although the forcing uncertainties are substantial, there are no apparent incorrect or missing global mean forcings in the CMIP5 models over the last 15 years that could explain the model-observations difference during the warming hiatus. 	0
Model Response Error The discrepancy between simulated and observed GMST trends during 1998-2012 could be explained in part by a tendency for some CMIP5 models to simulate stronger warming in response to increases in greenhouse gas  concentration than is consistent with observations . Averaged over the ensembles of models assessed in Section 10.3.1.1.3, the bestestimate GHG and other anthropogenic  scaling factors are less than one , indicating that the model-mean GHG and OA responses should be scaled down to best match observations. This finding provides evidence that some CMIP5 models show a larger response to GHGs and other anthropogenic factors  than the real world . As a consequence, it is argued in Chapter 11 that near-term model projections of GMST increase should be scaled down by about 10% . This downward scaling is, however, not sufficient to explain the model-mean overestimate of GMST trend over the hiatus period. Another possible source of model error is the poor representation of water vapour in the upper atmosphere . It has been suggested that a reduction in stratospheric water vapour after 2000 caused a reduction in downward longwave radiation and hence a surface-cooling contribution , possibly missed by the models, However, this effect is assessed here to be small, because there was a recovery in stratospheric water vapour after 2005 . 	0

In summary, the observed recent warming hiatus, defined as the reduction in GMST trend during 1998-2012 as compared to the trend during 1951-2012, is attributable in roughly equal measure to a cooling contribution from internal variability and a reduced trend in external forcing . The forcing trend reduction is primarily due to a negative forcing trend from both volcanic eruptions and the downward phase of the solar cycle. However, there is low confidence in quantifying the role of forcing trend in causing the hiatus, because of uncertainty in the magnitude of the volcanic forcing trend and low confidence in the aerosol forcing trend. Almost all CMIP5 historical simulations do not reproduce the observed recent warming hiatus. There is medium confidence that the GMST trend difference between models and observations during 1998-2012 is to a substantial degree caused by internal variability, with possible contributions from forcing error and some CMIP5 models overestimating the response to increasing GHG and other anthropogenic forcing. The CMIP5 model trend in ERF shows no apparent bias against the AR5 best estimate over 1998-2012. However, confidence in this assessment of CMIP5 ERF trend is low, primarily because of the uncertainties in model aerosol forcing and processes, which through spatial heterogeneity might well cause an undetected global mean ERF trend error even in the absence of a trend in the global mean aerosol loading.	0
The causes of both the observed GMST trend hiatus and of the model-observation GMST trend difference during 1998-2012 imply that, barring a major volcanic eruption, most 15-year GMST trends in the near-term future will be larger than during 1998-2012 . The reasons for this implication are fourfold: first, anthropogenic greenhouse-gas concentrations are expected to rise further in all RCP scenarios; second, anthropogenic aerosol concentration is expected to decline in all RCP scenarios, and so is the resulting cooling effect; third, the trend in solar forcing is expected to be larger over most near-term 15-year periods than over 1998-2012 , because 1998-2012 contained the full downward phase of the solar cycle; and fourth, it is more likely than not that internal climate variability in the near-term will enhance and not counteract the surface warming expected to arise from the increasing anthropogenic forcing.	0
Most climate model simulations show a larger warming in the tropical troposphere than is found in observational data sets . There has been an extensive and sometimes controversial debate in the published literature as to whether this difference is statistically significant, once observational uncertainties and natural variability are taken into account . For the period 1979-2012, the various observational data sets find, in the tropical lower troposphere , a linear warming trend ranging from 0.06C to 0.13C per decade . In the tropical middle troposphere , the linear warming trend ranges from 0.02C to 0.12C per decade . Uncertainty in these trend values arises from different methodological choices made by the groups deriving satellite products  and radiosonde compilations , and from fitting a linear trend to a time series containing substantial interannual and decadal variability ). Although there have been substantial methodological debates about the calculation of trends and their uncertainty, a 95% confidence interval of around 0.1C per decade has been obtained consistently for both LT and MT . In summary, despite unanimous agreement on the sign of the observed trends, there exists substantial disagreement between available estimates as to the rate 772	0
of temperature changes in the tropical troposphere, and there is only low confidence in the rate of change and its vertical structure . For the 30-year period 1979-2009 , the CMIP3 models simulate a tropical warming trend ranging from 0.1C to somewhat above 0.4C per decade for both LT and MT , while the CMIP5 models simulate a tropical warming trend ranging from slightly below 0.15C to somewhat above 0.4C per decade for both LT and MT . Both model ensembles show trends that on average are higher than in the observational estimates, although both model ensembles overlap the observational ensemble. Because the differences between the various observational estimates are largely systematic and structural , the uncertainty in the observed trends cannot be reduced by averaging the observations as if the differences between the data sets were purely random. Likewise, to properly represent internal climate variability, the full model ensemble spread must be used in a comparison against the observations . The very high significance levels of model-observation discrepancies in LT and MT trends that were obtained in some studies  thus arose to a substantial degree from using the standard error of the model ensemble mean as a measure of uncertainty, instead of the ensemble standard deviation or some other appropriate measure for uncertainty arising from internal climate	0
variability . Nevertheless, almost all model ensemble members show a warming trend in both LT and MT larger than observational estimates . The CMIP3 models show a 1979-2010 tropical SST trend of 0.19C per decade in the multi-model mean, significantly larger than the various observational trend estimates ranging from 0.10C to 0.14C per decade . As a consequence, simulated tropospheric temperature trends are also too large because models attempt to maintain static stability. By contrast, atmospheric models that are forced with the observed SST are in better agreement with observations, as was found in the CMIP3 model ECHAM5  and the CMIP5 atmosphere-only runs. In the latter, the LT trend range for the period 1981- 2008 is 0.13 to 0.19C per decade--less than in the CMIP5 coupled models, but still an overestimate . The influence of SST trend errors on the analysis can be reduced by considering trends in tropospheric static stability, measured by the amplification of MT trends against LT trends; another approach is to consider the amplification of tropospheric trends against SST trends. The results of such analyses strongly depend on the time scale considered. Monthto-month variations are consistent between observations and models concerning amplification aloft against SST variations  and concerning amplification of MT against LT variations . By contrast, the 30-year trend in tropical static stability has been found to be larger than in the satellite observations for almost all ensemble members in both CMIP3  and CMIP5 . However, if the radiosonde compilations are used for the comparison, the trends in static stability in the CMIP3 models agree much better with the observations, and inconsistency cannot be diagnosed unambiguously  . What caused the remaining trend overestimate in static stability is not clear but has been argued recently to result from an upward propagation of bias in the model climatology . In summary, most, though not all, CMIP3 and CMIP5 models overestimate the observed warming trend in the tropical troposphere during the satellite period 1979-2012. Roughly one-half to two-thirds of this difference from the observed trend is due to an overestimate of the SST trend, which is propagated upward because models attempt to maintain static stability. There is low confidence in these assessments, however, due to the low confidence in observed tropical tropospheric trend rates and vertical structure . 9.4.1.4.3	0
still produce too zonal a storm track in this region and most models underestimate cyclone intensity . Chang et al.  also find the storm tracks in the CMIP5 models to be too weak and too equatorwards in their position, similar to the CMIP3 models. The performance of the CMIP5 models in representing North Atlantic cyclones was found to be strongly dependent on model resolution . Studies based on individual models typically find that models capture the general characteristics of storm tracks and extratropical cyclones  and their associated fronts  and show improvements over earlier model versions . However, some models have deficiencies in capturing the location of storm tracks , in part owing to problems related to the location of warm waters such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Current . This is an important issue because future projections of storm tracks are sensitive to changes in SSTs . Some studies find that storm track and cyclone biases are strongly related to atmospheric processes and parameterizations . Representation of the Mediterranean storm track has been shown to be particularly dependent on model resolution , as is the representation of storm intensity and associated extremes in this area . Most studies have focussed on NH storm tracks. However, recently two CMIP3 models were found to differ significantly in their simulation of extratropical cyclones affecting Australia  and only about a third of the CMIP3 models were able to capture the observed changes and trends in Southern Hemisphere  baroclinicity responsible for a reduction in the growth rate of the leading winter storm track modes . There is still a lack of information on SH storm track evaluation for the CMIP5 models. 9.4.1.4.4	0
Earlier assessments of a weakening Walker circulation  from models and reanalyses  have been tempered by subsequent evidence that tropical Pacific Trade winds may have strengthened since the early 1990s . Models suggest that the width of the Hadley cell should increase , and there are indications that this has been observed over the past 25 years  but at an apparent rate  that is faster than in the CMIP3 models . The tendency in a warming climate for wet areas to receive more precipitation and subtropical dry areas to receive less, often termed the `rich-get richer' mechanism  is simulated in CMIP3 models , and observational support for this is found from ocean salinity observations  and precipitation gauge data over land . There is medium confidence that models are correct in simulating precipitation increases in wet areas and decreases in dry areas on broad spatial scales in a warming climate based on agreement among models and some evidence that this has been detected in observed trends . 773	0
Several recent studies have examined the co-variability of tropical climate variables as a further means of evaluating climate models. Specifically, there are observed relationships between lower tropospheric temperature and total column precipitable water , and between surface temperature and relative humidity . Figure 9.9  shows the relationship between 25-year  linear trends in tropical precipitable water and lower tropospheric temperature for individual historical simulations . As described by Mears et al. , the ratio between changes in these two quantities is fairly tightly constrained in the model simulations and similar across a range of time scales, indicating that relative humidity is close to invariant in each model. In the updated figure, the Remote Sensing System  observations are in fairly good agreement with model expectations, and the University of Alabama in Huntsville  observations less so. The points associated with two of the reanalyses are also relatively far from the line, consistent with long-term changes in relative humidity. It is not known whether these discrepancies are due to remaining inhomogeneity in the observational data and/or reanalysis results, or due to problems with the climate simulations. All of the observational and reanalysis points lie at the lower end of the model distribution, consistent with the findings of .		0
Since the AR4, there is increasing evidence that the ozone hole has led to a poleward shift and strengthening of the SH mid-latitude tropospheric jet during summer . These trends are well captured in both chemistry-climate models  with interactive stratospheric chemistry and in CMIP3 models with prescribed time-varying ozone . However, around half of the CMIP3 models prescribe ozone as a fixed climatological value, and so these models are not able to simulate trends in surface climate attributable to changing stratospheric ozone amount . For CMIP5, a new time-varying ozone data set  was developed and prescribed in the majority of models without interactive chemistry. This zonal mean data set is based on observations by Randel and Wu  and CCM projections in the future . Further, nine of the CMIP5 models include interactive chemistry and so compute their own ozone evolution. As a result, all CMIP5 models consider stratospheric ozone depletion and capture associated effects on SH surface climate, a significant advance over CMIP3. Figure 9.10 shows the global annual mean and Antarctic October mean of total column ozone in the CMIP5 models. The simulated trends in total column ozone are in medium agreement with observations, noting that some models that calculate ozone interactively show significant deviations from observation . The multi-model mean agrees well with observations, and there is robust evidence that this constitutes a significant improvement over CMIP3, where around half of the models did not include stratospheric	0

Note that the IGAC/SPARC database over Antarctica  is based on ozonesonde measurements at the vortex edge  and as a result underestimates Antarctic ozone depletion compared to the observations shown. Ozone depletion was more pronounced after 1960 as equivalent stratospheric chlorine values steadily increased throughout the stratosphere. 	0
ozone trends. Correspondingly, there is high confidence that the representation of associated effects on high-latitude surface climate and lower stratospheric cooling trends has improved compared to CMIP3. Lower stratospheric temperature change is affected by ozone, and since 1958 the change is characterized by a long-term global cooling trend interrupted by three 2-year warming episodes following large volcanic eruptions . During the satellite era  the cooling occurred mainly in two step-like transitions in the aftermath of the El Chichon eruption in 1982 and the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991, with each cooling transition followed by a period of relatively steady temperatures . This specific evolution of global lower stratosphere temperatures since 1979 is well captured in the CMIP5 models when forced with both natural and anthropogenic climate forcings, although the models tend to underes-	0
timate the long-term cooling trend  . Tropospheric ozone is an important GHG and as such needs to be well represented in climate simulations. In the historical period it has increased due to increases in ozone precursor emissions from anthropogenic activities . Since the AR4, a new emission data set has been developed , which has led to some differences in tropospheric ozone burden compared to previous studies, mainly due to biomass burning emissions . Climatological mean tropospheric ozone in the CMIP5 simulations generally agrees well with satellite observations and ozonesondes, although as in the stratosphere, biases exist for individual models  . 775	0

texts . Part of this can be attributed to uncertainties in the representation of sea ice and vegetation feedbacks that have been shown to amplify the response at the LGM and the MH in these latitudes . Biases in the representation of the coupling between vegetation and soil moisture are also responsible for excessive continental drying at the LGM  and u ncertainties in vegetation feedback in monsoon regions . Nevertheless, the ratio between the simulated change in temperature over land and over the ocean  is rather similar in different models, resulting mainly from simulation of the hydrological cycle over land and ocean . At a regional scale, models tend to underestimate the changes in the north-south temperature gradient over Europe both at the LGM  and at the mid-Holocene . The large-scale pattern of precipitation change during the MH  is reproduced, but models tend to underestimate the magnitude of precipitation change in most regions. In the SH , the simulated change in atmospheric circulation is consistent with precipitation records in Patagonia and New Zealand, even though the differences between model results are large and the reconstructions have large uncertainties .

Accurate simulation of the ocean in climate models is essential for the correct estimation of transient ocean heat uptake and transient climate response, ocean CO2 uptake, sea level rise, and coupled climate modes such as ENSO. In this section model performance is assessed for the mean state of ocean properties, surface fluxes and their impact on the simulation of ocean heat content and sea level, and aspects of importance for climate variability. Simulations of both the recent and more distant past are evaluated against available data. Following Chapter 3, ocean reanalyses are not used for model evaluation as many of their properties depend on the model used to build the reanalysis.	0

The observed climatological values are sourced from the World Ocean Atlas 2009 , and are shown as labelled black contours. White contours show regions in  where potential temperature differences exceed positive or negative 1, 2 or 3C, and in  where salinity differences exceed positive or negative 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 or 1 . The simulated annual mean climatologies are obtained for 1975 to 2005 from available historical simulations, whereas WOA09 synthesizes observed data from 1874 to 2008 in calculations of the annual mean; however, the median time for gridded observations most closely resembles the 1980-2010 period . Multiple realizations from individual models are first averaged to form a single-model climatology, before the construction of the multi-model ensemble mean. A total of 43 available CMIP5 models have contributed to the temperature panel  and 41 models to the salinity panel .	0
In the AR4 it was noted that the largest errors in SST in CMIP3 were found in mid and high latitudes. While this is still the case in CMIP5, there is marginal improvement with fewer individual models exhibiting serious bias--the inter-model zonal mean SST error standard deviation is significantly reduced at all latitudes north of 40oS--even though the multi-model mean is only slightly improved . Near the equator, the cold tongue error in the Pacific  is reduced by 30% in CMIP5; the Atlantic still exhibits serious errors and the Indian is still well simulated . In the Tropics, Li and Xie  have shown that SST errors could be classified into those exhibiting broad meridional structures that are due to cloud errors, and those associated with Pacific and Atlantic cold tongue errors that are due to thermocline depth errors.	0
The performance of coupled climate models in simulating hydrographic structure and variability were assessed in two important regions, the Labrador and Irminger Seas and the Southern Ocean  and . Eight CMIP3 models produce simulations of the intermediate and deep layers in the Labrador and Irminger Seas that are generally too warm and saline, with biases up to 0.7 psu and 2.9C. The biases arise because the convective regime is restricted to the upper 500 m; thus, intermediate water that in reality is formed by convection is, in the models, partly replaced by warmer water from the south. In the Southern Ocean, Subantarctic Mode Water  and Antarctic Intermediate Water , two water masses indicating very efficient ocean ventilation, are found to be well simulated in some CMIP3 and CMIP5 models but not in others, some having a significant fresh bias . McClean and Carman  found biases in the properties of the North Atlantic mode waters and their formation rates in the CMIP3 models. Errors in Subtropical Mode Water  formation rate and volume produce a turnover time of 1 to 2 years, approximately half of that observed. Bottom water properties assessment in CMIP5 shows that about half of the models create dense water on	0
the Antarctic shelf, but it mixes with lighter water and is not exported as bottom water. Instead most models create deep water by open ocean deep convection, a process occurring rarely in reality  which leads to errors in deep water formation and properties in the Southern Ocean as shown in Figure 9.15. Few studies have assessed the performance of models in simulating Mixed Layer Depth . In the North East Pacific region, Jang et al.  found that the CMIP3 models exhibit the observed deep MLD in the Kuroshio Extension, though with a deep bias and only one large deep MLD region, rather than the observed two localized maxima. Other studies have noted MLD biases near sea ice edges .	0

al., 2006; Domingues et al., 2008). Figure 9.17 shows observed and simulated global 0 to 700 m and total OHC changes during the overlap period of the observational record and the CMIP5 historical experiment . Three upper-ocean observational estimates, assessed in Chapter 3, are also shown to indicate observational uncertainty. The CMIP5 multi-model mean falls within the range of observations for most of the period, and the intermodel spread is reduced relative to CMIP3 . This may result from most CMIP5 models including volcanic forcings. When the deep ocean is included, the CMIP5 multi-model mean also agrees well with the observations, although the deeper ocean estimates are much more uncertain . There is high confidence that many CMIP5 models reproduce the observed increase in ocean heat content since 1960. EMIC results for changes in total OHC are also compared with observations in Figure 9.17.  who show OHC changes for 0 to 2000 m, whereas here the time-integrated net heat flux into the ocean surface is shown to compare with CMIP5 results ). There is a tendency for the EMICs to overestimate total OHC changes and this could alter the temperature related feedbacks on the oceanic carbon cycle, and affect the long-term millennium projections in Chapter 12. However, it should be noted that high OHC changes can compensate for biases in climate sensitivity or RF so as to reproduce surface temperature changes over	0
the 20th century. This will result in biased thermosteric sea level rise for millennial projections. Calibrated EMICs  would remove such biases. In idealized CMIP5 experiments , the heat uptake efficiency of the CMIP5 models varies by a factor of two, explaining about 50% of the model spread . Despite observational uncertainties, this recent work also provides limited evidence that in the upper 2000 m, most CMIP5 models are less stratified  than is observed, which suggests that these models transport heat downwards more efficiently than the real ocean. These results are consistent with earlier studies  that conclude the CMIP3 models may overestimate oceanic mixing efficiency and therefore underestimate the Transient Climate Response  and its impact on future surface warming. However, Kuhlbrodt and Gregory  also find that this apparent bias explains very little of the model spread in TCR. Although some progress has been made in understanding mixing deficiencies in ocean models , this remains a key challenge in improving the representation of physical processes that impact the evolution of ocean heat content and thermal expansion.	0

range in the zonal mean ACC position is smaller than in the CMIP3 ensemble . Simulation of glacial ocean conditions Reconstructions of the last glacial maximum from sediment cores discussed in Chapter 5 indicate that the regions of deep water formation in the North Atlantic were shifted southward, that the boundary between North Atlantic Deep Water  and Antarctic Bottom Water  was substantially shallower than today, and that NADW formation was less intense . This signal, although estimated from a limited number of sites, is robust . The AR4 reported that model simulations showed a wide range of AMOC response to LGM forcing , with some models exhibiting reduced strength of the AMOC and its extension at depth and other showing no change or an increase.

Southern Ocean circulation The Southern Ocean is an important driver for the meridional overturning circulation and is closely linked to the zonally continuous Antarctic Circumpolar Current . Gupta et al.  noted that relatively small deficiencies in the position of the ACC lead to more obvious biases in the SST in the models. The ability of CMIP3 models to adequately represent Southern Ocean circulation and water masses seems to be affected by several factors . The most important are the strength of the westerlies at the latitude of the Drake Passage, the heat flux gradient over this region, and the change in salinity with depth across the ACC. Kuhlbrodt et al.  found that the strongest influence on ACC transport in the CMIP3 models was the Gent-McWilliams thickness diffusivity. The ACC has a typical transport through the Drake Passage of about 135 Sv . A comparison of CMIP5 models  shows that, firstly, the ACC transport through Drake Passage is improved as compared to the CMIP3 models, and secondly, that the inter-model Present	0

At these latitudes, the largest near surface wind speed biases in CMIP5 are located over the Pacific sector and the smallest are in the Atlantic sector .

although there is some suggestion of modest underestimate between 15N and 25N and south of about 60S. Some models show an equatorward transport at Southern-Hemisphere mid-latitudes that is also featured in the observation estimate of Large and Yeager . This highlights the difficulties in representing large-scale energy processes in the Southern ocean as discussed by Trenberth and Fasullo . Note that climate models should exhibit a vanishing net energy balance when long time averages are considered but unphysical sources and sinks lead to energy biases  that are also found in reanalysis constrained by observations . When correcting for the imperfect closure of the energy cycle, as done here, comparison between models and observational estimates become possible.	0
along the equator, the structure of the equatorial current system, and the excessive equatorial cold tongue . Many reasons for these biases have been proposed, such as: too strong trade winds; a too diffusive thermocline; deficient horizontally isotropic mixing coefficients; insufficient penetration of solar radiation; and too weak tropical instability waves . It is noteworthy that CMIP5 models exhibit some improvements in the western equatorial Pacific when compared to CMIP3, with reduced SST and trade wind errors . Because of strong interactions between the processes involved, it is difficult to identify the ultimate source of these errors, although new approaches using the rapid adjustment of initialized simulations hold promise .	0
CMIP3 and CMIP5 models exhibit severe biases in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, so severe that some of the most fundamental features--the east-west SST gradient and the eastward shoaling thermocline along the equator--cannot be reproduced . In many models, the warm SST bias along the Benguela coast is in excess of 5C and the Atlantic warm pool in the western basin is grossly underestimated . As in the Pacific, CMIP3 models suffer the double ITCZ error in the Atlantic. Hypotheses for the complex Atlantic bias problem tend to draw on the fact that the Atlantic Ocean has a far smaller basin, and thus encourages a tighter and more complex land- atmosphere-ocean interaction. A recent study using a high-resolution coupled model suggests that the warm eastern equatorial Atlantic SST bias is more sensitive to the local rather than basin-wide trade wind bias and to a wet Congo basin instead of a dry Amazon--a finding that differs from previous studies . Recent ocean model studies show that a warm subsurface temperature bias in the eastern equatorial Atlantic is common to virtually all ocean models forced with `best estimated' surface momentum and heat fluxes, owing to problems in parameterization of vertical mixing . Toniazzo and Woolnough  show that among a variety of causes for the initial bias development, ocean-atmosphere coupling is key for their maintenance. 9.4.2.5.3	0
CMIP3 and CMIP5 models simulate equatorial Indian Ocean climate reasonably well , though most models produce weak westerly winds and a flat thermocline on the equator. The models show a large spread in the modelled depth of the 20C isotherm in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean . The reasons are unclear but may be related to differences in the various parameterizations of vertical mixing as well as the wind structure . CMIP3 models generally simulate the Seychelles Chagos thermocline ridge in the Southwest Indian Ocean, a feature important for the Indian monsoon and tropical cyclone activity in this basin . The models, however, have significant problems in accurately representing its seasonal cycle because of the difficulty in capturing the asymmetric nature of the monsoonal winds over the basin, resulting in too weak a semi-annual harmonic in the local Ekman pumping over the ridge region compared to observations . In about half of the models, the thermocline ridge is displaced eastward associated with the easterly wind biases on the equator .	0
et al., 2012) that in some cases model improvements, such as new sea ice albedo parameterization schemes , have been responsible.  show that models with initially thicker ice generally retain more extensive ice throughout the 21st century, and indeed several of the CMIP5 models start the 20th century with rather thin winter ice cover promoting more rapid melt . Notz et al.  caution, however, against direct comparison of modelled trends with observations unless the models' internal variability is carefully taken into account. Their analysis of the MPI-ESM ensemble shows that internal variability in the Arctic can result in individual model realizations exhibiting a range of trends  for the 29-year-long period starting in 1979, even if the background climate is warming. According to the distribution of sea ice extent trends over the period 1979-2010 obtained in an ensemble of simulations with individual CMIP5 models  about one quarter of the simulations shows a September trend in the Arctic as strong as, or stronger, than in observations.	0
The CMIP5 multi-model ensemble exhibits improvements over CMIP3 in simulation of sea ice extent in the both hemispheres . In the Arctic, the multi-model mean error do not exceed 10% of the observationally based estimates for any given month. In the Antarctic, the corresponding multi-model mean error exceeds 10%  near the annual minimum of sea ice extent; around the annual maximum, the CMIP5 multi-model mean shows a clear improvement over CMIP3. In many models the regional distribution of sea ice concentration is poorly simulated, even if the hemispheric extent is approximately correct. In Figure 9.23, however, one can see that the median ice edge position  agrees reasonably well with observations in both hemispheres , as was the case for the CMIP3 models. A widely discussed feature of the CMIP3 models as a group is a pronounced underestimation of the trend in the September  sea ice extent in the Arctic over the past several decades . Possible reasons for the discrepancy include variability inherent to high latitudes, model shortcomings, and observational uncertainties . Compared to CMIP3, the CMIP5 models better simulate the observed trend of September Arctic ice extent . It has been suggested (Stroeve 788	0
The majority of CMIP5  models exhibit a decreasing trend in SH austral summer sea ice extent over the satellite era, in contrast to the observed weak but significant increase . A large spread in the modelled trends is present, and a comparison of multiple ensemble members from the same model suggests large internal variability during the late 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century . Compared to observations, CMIP5 models strongly overestimate the variability of sea ice extent, at least in austral winter .Therefore, using the models to assess the potential role of the internal variability in the trend of sea ice extent in the Southern Ocean over the last three decades presents a significant challenge. Sea ice is a product of atmosphere-ocean interaction. There are a number of ways in which sea ice is influenced by and interacts with the atmosphere and ocean, and some of these feedbacks are still poorly quantified. As noted in the AR4, among the primary causes of biases in simulated sea ice extent, especially its geographical distribution, are problems with simulating high-latitude winds, ocean heat advection and mixing. For example, Koldunov et al.  have shown, for a particular CMIP3 model, that significant ice thickness errors originate from biases in the atmospheric component. Similarly, Melsom et al.  note sea ice improvements associated with improved description of heat transport by ocean currents. Biases imparted on modelled sea ice, common to many models, may also be related to representation of high-latitude processes  or processes not yet commonly included in models . Some CMIP5 models show improvements in simulation of sea ice that are connected to improvements in simulation of the atmosphere .	0

9.4.4.1 Snow Cover and Near-Surface Permafrost The modelling of snow and near-surface permafrost  processes has received increased attention since the AR4, in part because of the recognition that these processes can provide significant feedbacks on climate change . The SnowMIP2 project compared results from 33 snowpack models of varying complexity, including some snow models that are used in AOGCMs, using driving data from five NH locations . Most snow models were found to be consistent with observations at open sites, but there was much greater discrepancy at forested sites due to the complex interactions between plant canopy and snow cover. Despite these difficulties, the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble reproduces key features of the large-scale snow cover . In the NH, models are able to simulate the seasonal cycle of snow cover over the northern parts of continents, with more disagreement in southerly regions where snow cover is sparse, particularly over China and Mongolia . The latter weaknesses are associated with incorrect timing of the snow onset and melt, and possibly with the choice of thresholds for diagnosing snow cover in the model output. In spite of the good performance of the multi-model mean, there is a significant inter-model scatter of spring snow cover extent in some regions. There is a strong linear correlation between Northern-Hemisphere spring snow cover extent and annual mean surface air temperature in the models, consistent with available observations. The recent negative trend in spring snow cover is underestimated by the CMIP5  models , which is associated with an underestimate of the boreal land surface warming . Some CMIP5 models now represent NSP and frozen soil processes , but this is not generally the case. Therefore it is difficult to make a direct quantitative evaluation of most CMIP5 models against permafrost observations. A less direct but more inclusive approach is to diagnose NSP extent using snow depths and skin temperatures generated by climate models to drive a stand-alone multi-layer permafrost model . Figure 9.25 shows the result of using this approach on the CMIP5 ensemble. The multi-model mean is able to simulate the approximate location of the NSP boundary . However, the range of present-day  NSP area inferred from individual models spans a factor of more than six  due 790	0

to differences in simulated surface climate and to varying abilities of the underlying land surface models. Even though many CMIP5 models include some representation of soil freezing in mineral soils, very few include key processes necessary to accurately model NSP changes, such as the distinct properties of organic soils, the existence of local water tables and the heat released by microbial respiration . Despite large differences in the absolute NSP area, the relationship between the decrease in NSP area and the warming air temperature over the present-day NSP region is similar, and approximately linear, in many models .	0
representations of the land surface have significantly increased in complexity, allowing the representation of key processes such as links between stomatal conductance and photosynthesis, but at the cost of increasing the number of poorly known internal model parameters. These more sophisticated land surface models are based on physical principles that should make them more appropriate for projections of future climate and increased CO2. However for specific data-rich sites, current land surface models still struggle to perform as well as statistical models in predicting year-to-year variations in latent and sensible heat fluxes  and runoff . There are few evaluations of the performance of land surface schemes in coupled climate models, but those that have been undertaken find major limitations associated with the atmospheric forcing rather than the land surface schemes themselves. For example, an evaluation of the soil moisture simulations of CMIP3 models found that long-term soil moisture trends could only be reproduced in models that simulated the reduction in solar radiation at the surface associated with `global dimming' . A comparison of simulated evapotranspiration fluxes from CMIP3 against large-scale observation-based estimates, showed underestimates in India and parts of eastern South America, and overestimates in the western USA, Australia and China . Land-atmosphere coupling determines the ability of climate models to simulate the influence of soil moisture anomalies on rainfall, droughts and high-temperature extremes . The coupling strength depends both on the sensitivity of evapotranspiration to soil moisture, which is determined by the land surface scheme, and the sensitivity of precipitation to evapotranspiration, which is determined by the atmospheric model . Comparison of climate model simulations to observations suggests that the models correctly represent the soil-moisture impacts on temperature extremes in southeastern Europe, but overestimate them in central Europe . The influence of soil moisture on rainfall varies significantly with region, and with the lead-time between a soil moisture anomaly and a rainfall event . In some regions, such as the Sahel, enhanced precipitation can even be induced by dry anomalies . Recent analyses of CMIP5 models reveals considerable spread in the ability of the models to reproduce observed correlations between precipitation and soil moisture in the tropics , and a systematic failure to simulate the positive impact of dry soil moisture anomalies on rainfall in the Sahel .	0
9.4.4.3 Dynamic Global Vegetation and Nitrogen Cycling At the time of the AR4 very few climate models included dynamic vegetation, with vegetation being prescribed and fixed in all but a handful of coupled climate-carbon cycle models . Dynamic Global Vegetation Models  certainly existed at the time of the AR4  but these were not typically incorporated in climate models. Since the AR4 there has been continual development of offline DGVMs, and some climate models incorporate dynamic vegetation in at least a subset of the runs submitted to CMIP5 , with likely consequences for climate model biases and regional climate projection .	0
DGVMs are designed to simulate the large-scale geographical distribution of plant functional types and how these patterns will change in response to climate change, CO2 increases, and other forcing factors . These models typically include rather detailed representations of plant photosynthesis but less sophisticated treatments of soil carbon, with a varying number of soil carbon pools. In the absence of nitrogen limitations on CO2 fertilization, offline DGVMs agree qualitatively that CO2 increase alone will tend to enhance carbon uptake on the land while the associated climate change will tend to reduce it. There is also good agreement on the degree of CO2 fertilization in the case of no nutrient limitation . However, under more extreme emissions scenarios the responses of the DGVMs diverge markedly. Large uncertainties are associated with the responses of tropical and boreal ecosystems to elevated temperatures and changing soil moisture status. Particular areas of uncertainty are the high-temperature response of photosynthesis , and the extent of CO2 fertilization  in the Amazonian rainforest. Most of the land surface models and DGVMs used in the CMIP5 models continue to neglect nutrient limitations on plant growth , even though these may significantly moderate the response of photosynthesis to CO2 . Recent extensions of two land surface models to include nitrogen limitations improve the fit to `Free-Air CO2 Enrichment Experiments', and suggest that models without these limitations are expected to overestimate the land carbon sink in the nitrogen-limited mid and high latitudes .	0
9.4.4.4 Land Use Change A major innovation in the land component of ESMs since the AR4 is the inclusion of the effects of land use change associated with the spread of agriculture, urbanization and deforestation. These affect climate by altering the biophysical properties of the land surface, such as its albedo, aerodynamic roughness and water-holding capacity . Land use change has also contributed almost 30% of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions since 1850 , and affects emissions of trace gases, and VOCs such as isoprene. The latest ESMs used in CMIP5 attempt to model the CO2 emissions implied by prescribed land use change and many also simulate the associated changes in the biophysical properties of the land surface. This represents a major advance on the CMIP3 models which typically neglected land use change, aside from its assumed contribution to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, the increasing sophistication of the modelling of the impacts of land use change has introduced additional spread in climate model projections. The first systematic model intercomparison demonstrated that large-scale land cover change can significantly affect regional climate  and showed a large spread in the response of different models to the same imposed land cover change . This uncertainty arises from the often counteracting effects of evapotranspiration and albedo changes  and has consequences for the simulation of temperature and rainfall extremes .	0
The transition from AOGCMs to ESMs was motivated in part by the results from the first generation coupled climate-carbon cycle models, which suggested that feedbacks between the climate and the carbon cycle were uncertain but potentially very important in the context of 21st century climate change . The first-generation models used in the Coupled Climate Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project  included both extended AOGCMS and EMICs. The C4MIP experimental design involved running each model under a common emission scenario  and calculating the evolution of the global atmospheric CO2 concentration interactively within the model. The impacts of climate-carbon cycle feedbacks were diagnosed by carrying out parallel "uncoupled" simulations in which increases in atmospheric CO2 did not influence climate. Analysis of the C4MIP runs highlighted a greater than 200 ppmv range in the CO2 concentration by 2100 due to uncertainties in climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, and that the largest uncertainties were associated with the response of land ecosystems to climate and CO2 . For CMIP5 a different experimental design was proposed in which the core simulations use prescribed RCPs of atmospheric CO2 and other GHGs . Under a prescribed CO2 scenario, ESMs calculate land and ocean carbon fluxes interactively, but these fluxes do not affect the evolution of atmospheric CO2. Instead the modelled land and ocean fluxes, along with the prescribed increase in atmospheric CO2, can be used to diagnose the `compatible' emissions of CO2 consistent with the simulation . The compatible emissions for each model can then be evaluated against the best estimates of the actual historical CO2 emissions. Parallel model experiments in which the carbon cycle does not respond to the simulated climate change  provide a means to diagnose climate-carbon cycle feedbacks in terms of their impact on the compatible emissions of CO2 . Carbon cycle model evaluation is limited by the availability of direct observations at appropriately large spatial scales. Field studies and eddy-covariance flux measurements provide detailed information on the land carbon cycle over short-time scales and for specific locations, and ocean inventories are able to constrain the long-term uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the ocean . However the stores of carbon on the land are less well-known, even though these are important determinants of the CO2 fluxes from land use change. ESM simulations vary by a factor of at least six in global soil carbon  and by a factor of four in global vegetation carbon, although about two thirds 792	0
of models are within 50% of the uncertain observational estimates . Large-scale land-atmosphere and global atmosphere fluxes are not directly measured, but global estimates can be made from the carbon balance, and large-scale regional fluxes can be estimated from the inversion of atmospheric CO2 measurements . Figure 9.26 shows modelled annual mean ocean-atmosphere and net land- atmosphere CO2 fluxes from the historical simulations in the CMIP5 archive . Also shown are estimates derived from offline ocean carbon cycle models, measurements of atmospheric CO2, and best estimates of the CO2 fluxes from fossil fuels and land use change . Uncertainties in these latter annual estimates are approximately 0.5 PgC yr-1, arising predominantly from the uncertainty in the model-derived ocean CO2 uptake. The confidence limits for the ensemble mean are derived by assuming that the CMIP5 models form a t-distribution centred on the ensemble mean . The evolution of the global ocean carbon sink is shown in the top panel of Figure 9.26. The CMIP5 ensemble mean global ocean uptake , computed using all the 23 models that reported ocean CO2 fluxes, increases from 0.47  0.32 PgC yr-1 over the period 1901-1930 to 1.53  0.36 PgC yr-1 for the period 1960-2005. For comparison, the Global Carbon Project  estimates a stronger ocean carbon sink of 1.92  0.3 PgC yr-1 for 1960-2005 . The bottom panel of Figure 9.26 shows the variability in global land carbon uptake evident in the GCP estimates, with the global land carbon sink being strongest during La Nina years and after volcanoes, and turning into a source during El Nino years. The CMIP5 models cannot be expected to precisely reproduce this year-to-year variability as these models will naturally simulate chaotic ENSO variability that is out of phase with the historical variability. However, the ensemble mean does successfully simulate a strengthening global land carbon sink during the 1990s, especially after the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991. The CMIP5 ensemble mean land-atmosphere flux  evolves from a small source of -0.34  0.49 PgC yr-1 over the period 1901- 1930, predominantly due to land use change, to a sink of 0.47  0.72 PgC yr-1 in the period 1960-2005. The GCP estimates give a weaker sink of 0.36  1 PgC yr-1 for the 1960-2005 period. Figure 9.27 shows the ocean-atmosphere fluxes  and mean land-atmosphere fluxes  simulated by ESMs and EMICs  for the period 1986-2005, and compares these to observation-based estimates from GCP and Atmospheric Tracer Transport Model Intercomparison Project  atmospheric inversions . Unlike Figure 9.26, only models that reported both land and ocean carbon fluxes are included in this figure. The atmospheric inversions results are taken from the Japanese Meteorological Agency  as this was the only TRANSCOM3 model that reported results for all years of the 1986-2005 reference period. The error bars on the observational estimates  and the ESM simulations  represent the interannual variation in the form of the standard deviation of the annual fluxes. EMICs do not typically simulate interannual variability, so only mean values are shown for these models . Here, as in Figure 9.26, the net	0
land-atmosphere flux is `Net Biome Productivity ' which includes the net CO2 emissions from land use change as well as the changing carbon balance of undisturbed ecosystems. For the period 1986-2005 the observation-based estimates of the global ocean carbon sink are 1.71 PgC yr-1 , 2.19 PgC yr-1  and 2.33 PgC yr-1 . Taking into account the uncertainties in the mean values of these fluxes associated with interannual variability, the observationally constrained range is approximately 1.4 to 2.4 PgC yr-1. All of the ESMs, and all but one of the EMICs, simulate ocean sinks within this range. The observation-based estimates of GCP and JMA agree well on the mean global land carbon sink over the period 1986-2005, and most ESMs fit within the uncertainty bounds of these estimates . The exceptions are two ESMs sharing common atmosphere and land components  which model a net land carbon source rather than a sink over this period. The EMICs tend to	0
systematically underestimate the contemporary land carbon sink . Some ESMs  significantly overestimate the interannual variation in the global land- atmosphere CO2 flux, with a possible consequence being an overestimate of the vulnerability of tropical ecosystems to future climate change , and see Figure 9.45). All ESMs qualitatively simulate the expected pattern of ocean CO2 fluxes, with outgassing in the tropics and uptake in the mid and high latitudes . However, there are systematic differences between the ESMs and the JMA inversion estimates for the zonal land CO2 fluxes, with the ESMs tending to produce weaker uptake in the NH, and simulating a net land carbon sink rather than a source in the tropics. In summary, there is high confidence that CMIP5 ESMs can simulate the global mean land and ocean carbon sinks within the range of observation-based estimates. Overall, EMICs reproduce the recent global ocean CO2 fluxes uptake as well as ESMs, but estimate a lower 793	0
between 2000 and 2005 . For the period 2001 to 2005, CMIP5 models underestimate the mean AOD at 550 nm relative to satellite-retrieved AOD by at least 20% over virtually all land surfaces . The differences between the modelled and measured AODs exceed the errors in the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer  retrievals over land of 0.05 or 0.2xAOD  and the RMS errors in the corrected Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer  retrievals over ocean of 0.061. The effects of sulphate and other aerosol species on surface insolation through direct and indirect forcing appear to be one of the principal causes of the `global dimming' between the 1960s and 1980s and subsequent `global brightening' in the last two decades . This inference is supported by trends in aerosol optical depth and trends in surface insolation under cloud-free conditions. Thirteen out of 14 CMIP3 models examined by Ruckstuhl and Norris  produce a transition from "dimming" to `brightening' that is consistent with the timing of the transition from increasing to decreasing global anthropogenic aerosol emissions. The transition from `dimming' to `brightening' in both Europe and North America is well simulated with the HadGEM2 model .	0
land carbon sink compared with most ESMs while remaining consistent with the observations . With few exceptions, the CMIP5 ESMs also reproduce the large-scale pattern of ocean-atmosphere CO2 fluxes, with uptake in the Southern Ocean and northern mid-latitudes, and outgassing in the tropics. However, the geographical pattern of simulated land-atmosphere fluxes agrees much less well with inversion estimates, which suggest a larger sink in the northern mid-latitudes, and a net source rather than a sink in the tropics. While there are also inherent uncertainties in atmospheric inversions, discrepancies like this might be expected from known deficiencies in the CMIP5 generation of ESMs--namely the failure to correctly simulate nitrogen fertilization in the mid-latitudes, and a rudimentary treatment of the net CO2 emissions arising from land use change and forest regrowth.	0
9.4.6.1 Recent Trends in Global Aerosol Burdens and Effects on Insolation The ability of CMIP5 models to simulate the current burden of tropospheric aerosol and the decadal trends in this burden can be assessed using observations of aerosol optical depth . The historical data used to drive the CMIP5 20th century simulations reflect recent trends in anthropogenic SO2 emissions, and hence these trends should be manifested in the modelled and observed AOD. During the last three decades, anthropogenic emissions of SO2 from North America and Europe have declined due to the imposition of emission controls, while the emissions from Asia have increased. The combination of the European, North American, and Asians trends has yielded a global reduction in SO2 emissions of 20 Gg, or 15% between 1970 and 2000 although emissions subsequently increased by 9 Gg 794	0
These recent trends are superimposed on a general upward trend in aerosol loading since 1850 reflected by an increase in global mean oceanic AODs from the CMIP5 historical and RCP 4.5 simulations from 1850 to 2010 . Despite the use of common anthropogenic aerosol emissions for the historical simulations , the simulated oceanic AODs for 2010 range from 0.08 to 0.215, with nearly equal numbers of models over and underestimating the satellite retrieved AOD of 0.12 . This range in AODs results from differing estimates of the trends and of the initial global mean oceanic AOD at 1850 across the CMIP5 ensemble .	0
9.4.6.2 Principal Sources of Uncertainty in Projections of Sulphate Burdens Natural sources of sulphate from oxidation of dimethylsulphide  emissions from the ocean surface are not specified under the RCP protocol and therefore represent a source of uncertainty in the sulphur cycle simulated by the CMIP5 ensemble. In simulations of present-day conditions, DMS emissions span a 5 to 95% confidence interval of 10.7 to 28.1 TgS yr-1 . After chemical processing, DMS contributes between 18 and 42% of the global atmospheric sulphate burden and up to 80% of the sulphate burden over most the SH . Several CMIP5 models include prognostic calculation of the biogenic DMS source; however, the effects from differences in DMS emissions on modelled sulphate burdens remain to be quantified. In contrast to CMIP3, the models in the CMIP5 ensemble are provided with a single internally consistent set of future anthropogenic SO2	0
emissions. The use of a single set of emissions removes an important, but not dominant, source of uncertainty in the AR5 simulations of the sulphur cycle. In experiments based on a single chemistry-climate model with perturbations to both emissions and sulphur-cycle processes, uncertainties in emissions accounted for 53.3% of the ensemble variance . The next largest source of uncertainty was associated with the wet scavenging of sulphate , which accounted for 29.5% of the intra-ensemble variance and represents the source/sink term with the largest relative range in the aerosol models evaluated by Faloona . Similarly, simulations run with heterogeneous or harmonized emissions data sets yielded approximately the same intermodel standard deviation in sulphate burden of 25 Tg. These results show that a dominant source of the spread among the sulphate burdens is associated with differences in the treatment of chemical production, transport, and removal from the atmosphere . Errors in modelled aerosol burden systematically affect anthropogenic RF .	0
to-noise estimates inherent in climate change detection and attribution studies where low-frequency climate variability must be estimated, at least in part, from long control integrations of climate models . It also has implications for the ability of models to make quantitative projections of changes in climate variability and the statistics of extreme events under a warming climate. In many cases, the impacts of climate change will be experienced more profoundly in terms of the frequency, intensity or duration of extreme events . The ability to simulate climate variability is also central to achieving skill in climate prediction by initializing models from the observed climate state .	0
9.5.2.1 Diurnal Cycles of Temperature and Precipitation The diurnally varying solar radiation received at a given location drives, through complex interactions with the atmosphere, land surface and upper ocean, easily observable diurnal variations in surface and near-surface temperature, precipitation, level stability and winds. The AR4 noted that climate models simulated the global pattern of the diurnal temperature range, zonally and annually averaged over the continent, but tended to underestimate its magnitude in many regions . New analyses over land indicate that model deficiencies in surface-atmosphere interactions and the planetary boundary layer are also expected to contribute to some of the diurnal cycle errors and that model agreement with observations depends on region, vegetation type and season . Analyses of CMIP3 simulations show that the diurnal amplitude of precipitation is realistic, but most models tend to start moist convection prematurely over land . Many CMIP5 models also have peak precipitation several hours too early compared to surface observations and TRMM satellite observations . This and the so-called `drizzling bias'  can have large adverse impacts on surface evaporation and runoff . Over the ocean, models often rain too frequently and underestimated the diurnal amplitude . It has also been suggested that a weak diurnal cycle of surface air temperature is produced over the ocean because of a lack of diurnal variations in SST , and most models have difficulty with this due to coarse vertical resolution and coupling frequency . Improved representation of the diurnal cycle has been found with increased atmospheric resolution  or with improved representation of cloud physics , but the reasons for these improvements remain poorly 796	0
Recent work has shown that models with high horizontal  or vertical resolution  are better able to simulate blocking. These improvement arise from increased representation of orography and atmospheric dynamics , as well as reduced ocean surface temperature errors in the extra tropics . Improved physical parameterizations have also been shown to improve simulations of blocking . However, as in CMIP3 , most of the CMIP5 models still significantly underestimate winter Euro-Atlantic blocking . These new results show that the representation of blocking events is improving in models, even though the overall quality of CMIP5 ensemble is medium. There is high confidence that model representation of blocking is improved through increases in model resolution.	0
Phenomenological diagnostics  and process-oriented diagnostics  have been used to evaluate MJO in climate models. An important reason for model errors in representing the MJO is that convection parameterizations do not provide sufficient build-up of moisture in the atmosphere for the large scale organized convection to occur . Biases in the model mean state also contribute to poor MJO simulation . High-frequency coupling with the ocean is also an important factor . While new parameterizations of convection may improve the MJO , this sometimes occurs at the expense of a good simulation of the mean tropical climate . In addition, high resolution models with an	0

The 20- to 100-day filtered OLR from observations and each of the CMIP5 historical simulations and the CMIP3 simulations of 20th century climate is projected on these two leading EOFs to obtain MJO Principal Component time series. The scatterplot  shows the maximum positive correlation between the resulting MJO Principal Components and the time lag at which it occurred for all winters . The maximum positive correlation is an indication of the coherence with which the MJO convection propagates from the Indian Ocean to the Maritime Continent/western Pacific, and the time lag is approximately one fourth of the period of the MJO. 	0
9.5.2.4 Large-Scale Monsoon Rainfall and Circulation Monsoons are the dominant modes of annual variation in the tropics , and affect weather and climate in numerous regions . High-fidelity simulation of the mean monsoon and its variability is of great importance for simulating future climate impacts . The monsoon is characterized by an annual reversal of the low level winds and well defined dry and wet seasons , and its variability is primarily connected to the MJO and ENSO . The AR4 reported that most CMIP3 models poorly represent the characteristics of the monsoon and monsoon teleconnections , though improvement in CMIP5 has been noted for the mean climate, seasonal cycle, intraseasonal and interannual variability . 798	0
The different monsoon systems are connected through the large-scale tropical circulation, offering the possibility to evaluate a models' representation of monsoon domain and intensity through the global monsoon concept . The CMIP5 multi-model ensemble generally reproduces the observed spatial patterns but somewhat underestimates the extent and intensity, especially over Asia and North America . The best model has similar performance to the multi-model mean, whereas the poorest models fail to capture the monsoon precipitation domain and intensity over Asia and the western Pacific, Central America, and Australia. Fan et al.  also show that CMIP3 simulations capture the observed trend of weakening of the South Asian summer circulation over the past half century, but are unable to reproduce the magnitude of the observed trend in precipitation. On longer time scales, mid-Holocene simulations show that even though models capture the sign of the monsoon precipitation changes, they tend to underestimate its magnitude  Poor simulation of the monsoon has been attributed to cold SST biases over the Arabian Sea , a weak meridional temperature gradient , unrealistic development of the Indian Ocean dipole (Achuthavarier et al., 2012; Boschat et al.,	0

The monsoon precipitation domain is defined where the annual range is >2.5 mm day-1, and the monsoon precipitation intensity is the seasonal range divided by the annual mean. The threat scores  indicate how well the models represent the monsoon precipitation domain compared to the GPCP data. The threat score in panel  is between GPCP and CMAP rainfall to indicate observational uncertainty, whereas in the other panel it is between the simulations and the GPCP observational data set. A threat score of 1.0 would indicate perfect agreement between the two data sets. See Wang and Ding ,Wang et al. , and Kim et al.  for details of the calculations.	0
2012) and changes to the circulation through excessive precipitation over the southwest equatorial Indian Ocean . These biases lead to too weak inland moisture transport and an underestimate of monsoon precipitation over India. Similar SST biases contribute to model-data mismatch in the simulation of the mid-Holocene Asian monsoon , even though the representation of atmospheric processes such as convection seems to dominate the model spread in this region  or over Africa . Factors that have contributed to improved representation of the monsoon in some CMIP5 models include better simulation of topography-related monsoon precipitation due to higher horizontal resolution , a more realistic ENSO-monsoon teleconnection  and improved propagation of intraseasonal variations . The impact of aerosols on monsoon precipitation and its variability is the subject of ongoing investigation . These results provide robust evidence that CMIP5 models simulate more realistic monsoon climatology and variability than their CMIP3 predecessors, but they still suffer from biases in the representation of the monsoon domain and intensity leading to medium model quality at the global scale and declining quality at the regional scale.	0
9.5.3.1 Global Surface Temperature Multi-Decadal Variability The AR4 concluded that modelled global temperature variance at decadal to inter-decadal time scales was consistent with 20th century observations. In addition, results from the last millennium suggest that simulated variability is consistent with indirect estimates . Figure 9.33a shows simulated internal variability of mean surface temperature from CMIP5 pre-industrial control simulations. Model spread is largest in the tropics and mid to high latitudes , where variability is also large; however, compared to CMIP3, the spread is smaller in the tropics owing to improved representation of ENSO variability . The power spectral density of global mean temperature variance in the historical simulations is shown in Figure 9.33b and is generally consistent with the observational estimates. At longer time scale of the spectra estimated from last millennium simulations, performed with a subset of the CMIP5 models, can be assessed by comparison with different NH temperature proxy records . The CMIP5 millennium simulations include natural and anthropogenic forcings  . Significant differences between unforced and forced simulations are seen for time scale larger than 799	0

9.5.3.2 Extratropical Circulation, North Atlantic Oscillation and Other Related Dipolar and Annular Modes Based on CMIP3 models, Gerber et al.  confirmed the AR4 assessment that climate models are able to capture the broad spatial and temporal features of the North Atlantic Oscillation , but there are substantial differences in the spatial patterns amongst individual models . Climate models tend to have patterns of variability that are more annular in character than observed . Models substantially overestimate persistence on sub-seasonal and seasonal time scales, and have difficulty simulating the seasonal cycle of annular mode time scales found in reanalyses . The unrealistically long time scale of variability is worse in models with particularly strong equatorward biases in the mean jet location, a result which has been found to hold in the North Atlantic and in the SH . As described in the AR4, climate models have generally been unable to simulate changes as strong as the observed NAO trend over the period 1965-1995, either in coupled mode  or forced with observed boundary conditions . However, there are a few exceptions to this , so it is unclear to what extent the underestimation of late 20th century trends reflects model shortcomings versus internal variability. Further evidence has emerged of the coupling of NAO variability between the troposphere and the stratosphere, and even models with improved stratospheric resolution appear to underestimate the vertical coupling  with consequences for the NAO response to anthropogenic forcing . The Pacific basin analogue of the NAO, the North Pacific Oscillation  is a prominent pattern of wintertime atmospheric circulation variability characterized by a north-south dipole in sea level pressure . Although climate models simulate the main spatial features of the NPO, many of them are unable to capture the observed linkages with tropical variability and the ocean . Raphael and Holland  showed that coupled models produce a clear Southern Annular Mode  but that there are relatively large differences between models in terms of the exact shape and orientation of this pattern. Karpechko et al.  found that the CMIP3 models have problems representing linkages between the SAM and SST, surface air temperature, precipitation and particularly sea ice in the Antarctic region.	0
Previous comparisons of the observed and simulated AMOC were restricted to its mean strength, as it had only been sporadically observed . Continuous AMOC time series now exist for latitudes 41N  and 26.5N  . At 26.5N, CMIP3 and CMIP5 model simulations show total AMOC variability that is within the observational uncertainty . However, the total AMOC is the sum of a wind-driven component and a mid-ocean geostrophic component. While both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models tend to overestimate the wind-driven variability, they tend to underestimate the mid-ocean geostrophic variability . The latter is suggested to result from deficiencies in the simulation of the hydrographic characteristics , specifically the Nordic Seas overflows . 9.5.3.3.2	0
The Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability , also known as Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation , is a mode of climate variability with an apparent period of about 70 years, and a pattern centred in the North Atlantic Ocean . In the AR4, it was shown that a number of climate models produced AMO-like multidecadal variability in the North Atlantic linked to variability in the strength of the AMOC. Subsequent analyses has confirmed this, however simulated time scales range from 40 to 60 years , to a century or more . In addition, the spatial patterns of variability related to the AMOC differ in many respects from one model to another as shown in Figure 9.34. The presence of AMO-like variability in unforced simulations, and the fact that forced 20th century simulations in the CMIP3 multi-model ensemble produce AMO variability that is not in phase with that observed, implies the AMO is not predominantly a result of the forcings imposed on the models . Results from the CMIP5 models also show a key role for internal variability, alongside a contribution from external forcings in recent decades . Historical AMO fluctuations have been better reproduced in a model with a more sophisticated aerosol treatment than was typically used in CMIP3 , albeit at the expense of introducing other observational inconsistencies . This could suggest that at least part of the AMO may in fact be forced, and that aerosols play a role. In addition to tropospheric aerosols, Ottera et al.  showed the potential for simulated volcanic forcing to have influenced AMO fluctuations over the last 600 years.	0

of both background climate  and internal variability exhibit serious systematic errors , many of which can be traced to the representation of deep convection, trade wind strength and cloud feedbacks, with little improvement from CMIP3 to CMIP5 . While a number of CMIP3 models do not exhibit an ENSO variability maximum at the observed 2- to 7- year time scale, most CMIP5 models do have a maximum near the observed range and fewer models have the tendency for biennial oscillations . In CMIP3 the amplitude of El Nino ranged from less than half to more than double the observed amplitude . By contrast, the CMIP5 models show less inter-model spread . The CMIP5 models still exhibit errors in ENSO amplitude, period, irregularity, skewness, spatial patterns (Lin, 804	0
2007; Leloup et al., 2008; Guilyardi et al., 2009b; Ohba et al., 2010; Yu and Kim, 2011; Su and Jiang, 2012) or teleconnections . Since AR4, new analysis methods have emerged and are now being applied. For example, Jin et al.  and Kim and Jin  identified five different feedbacks affecting the Bjerknes  index, which in turn characterizes ENSO stability. Kim and Jin  applied this process-based analysis to the CMIP3 multi-model ensemble and demonstrated a significant positive correlation between ENSO amplitude and the BJ index. When respective components of the BJ index obtained from the coupled models were compared with those from observations, it was shown that most coupled models underestimated the negative thermal damping feedback  and the positive zonal advective and thermocline feedbacks. Detailed quantitative evaluation of ENSO performance is hampered by the short observational record of key processes  and the complexity and diversity of the processes involved . While shortcomings	0
Indian Ocean SST displays a basin-wide warming following El Nino . This Indian Ocean basin  mode peaks in boreal spring and persists through the following summer. Most CMIP5 models capture this IOB mode, an improvement over CMIP3 . However, only about half the CMIP5 models capture its long temporal persistence, and these models tend to simulate ENSO-forced ocean Rossby waves in the tropical south Indian Ocean . The Indian Ocean zonal dipole mode   appears to be part of a hemispheric response to tropical atmospheric forcing . Most CMIP3 models are able to reproduce the general features of the IOD, including its phase lock onto the July to November season . The modelled SST anomalies, however, tend to show too strong a westward extension along the equator in the eastern Indian Ocean. CMIP3 models exhibit considerable spread in IOD amplitude, some of which can be explained by differences in the strength of the simulated Bjerknes feedback . No substantial change is seen in CMIP5 . Many models simulate the observed correlation between IOD and ENSO. The magnitude of this correlation varies substantially between models, but is apparently not tied to the amplitude of ENSO . A subset of CMIP3 models show a spurious correlation with ENSO following the decay of ENSO events, instead of during the ENSO developing phase, possibly due to erroneous representation of oceanic pathways connecting the equatorial Pacific and Indian Oceans . 9.5.3.4.3	0
These moist teleconnection pathways involve mechanisms related to those at play in the precipitation response to global warming  and provide challenging test statistics for model precipitation response. Compared to earlier generation climate models, CMIP3 and CMIP5 models tend to do somewhat better  at precipitation reductions associated with El Nino over equatorial South America and the Western Pacific, although CMIP5 offers little further improvement over CMIP3 . CMIP5 models simulate the sign of the precipitation change over broad regions, and do well at predicting the amplitude of the change  . A regression of the West African monsoon precipitation index with global SSTs reveals two major teleconnections . The first highlights the strong influence of ENSO, while the second reveals a relationship between the SST in the Gulf of Guinea and the northward migration of the monsoon rain belt over West Africa. Most CMIP3 models show a single dominant Pacific teleconnection, which is, however, of the wrong sign for half of the models . Only one model shows a significant second mode, emphasizing the difficulty in simulating the response of the African rain belt to Atlantic SST anomalies that are not synchronous with Pacific anomalies. Both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models have been evaluated and found to vary in their abilities to represent both the seasonal cycle of correlations between the Nino 3.4 and North Australian SSTs  with little change in quality from CMIP3 to CMIP5. Generally the models do not capture the strength of the negative correlations during the second half of the year. The models also still struggle to capture the SST evolution in the North Australian region during El Nino and La Nina. Teleconnection patterns from both ENSO and the Indian Ocean Dipole to precipitation over Australia are reasonably well simulated in the key September-November season  in the CMIP3 and CMIP5 multi-model mean.	0
The Pacific Decadal Oscillation  refers to a mode of variability involving SST anomalies over the North Pacific  . Although the PDO time series exhibits considerable decadal variability, it is difficult to ascertain whether there are any robust spectral peaks given the relatively short observational record . The ability of climate models to represent the PDO has been assessed by Stoner et al.  and Furtado et al. . Their results indicate that approximately half of the CMIP3 models simulate the observed spatial pattern and temporal behaviour ; however, spectral peaks are consistently higher in frequency than those suggested by the short observational record. The modelled PDO correlation with SST anomalies in the tropical Indo-Pacific are strongly underestimated by the CMIP3 models . Climate models have been shown to simulate features of the closely related Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation , although deficiencies remain in the strength of the tropical- extratropical connections.	0
9.5.4.1 Extreme Temperature Since the AR4, evaluation of CMIP3 and CMIP5 models has been undertaken with respect to temperature extremes. Both model ensembles simulate present-day warm extremes, in terms of 20-year return values, reasonably well, with errors typically within a few degrees Celsius over most of the globe . The CMIP5 and CMIP3 models perform comparably for various temperature extreme indices, but with smaller inter-model spread in CMIP5.The inter-model range of simulated indices is similar to the spread amongst observationally based estimates in most regions . Figure 9.37 shows relative error estimates of available CMIP5 models for various extreme indices based on Sillmann et al. . Although the relative performance of an individual model may depend on the choice of the reference data set , the mean and median models tend to outperform individual models. According to the standardized multi-model median errors  for CMIP3 and CMIP5 shown on the right side of Figure 9.37, the performance of the two ensembles is similar. In terms of historical trends, CMIP3 and CMIP5 models generally capture observed trends in temperature extremes in the second half of the 20th century , as illustrated in Figure 9.37. The modelled trends are consistent with both reanalyses and station-based estimates. It is also clear in the figure that model-based indices respond coherently to major volcanic eruptions. Detection and attribution studies based on CMIP3 models suggest that models tend to overestimate the observed warming of warm temperature extremes and underestimate the warming of cold extremes in the second half of 20th century  as noted in SREX . See also Chapter 10. This is not as obvious in the CMIP5 model evaluation ) and needs further investigation.	0
9.5.4.2 Extreme Precipitation For extreme precipitation, observational uncertainty is much larger than for temperature, making model evaluation more challenging. Discrepancies between different reanalyses for extreme precipitation are substantial, whereas station-based observations have limited spatial coverage . Moreover, a station-based observational data set, which is interpolated from station measurements, has a potential mismatch of spatial scale when compared to model results or reanalyses . Uncertainties are especially large in the tropics. In the extratropics, precipitation extremes in terms of 20-year return values simulated by CMIP3 and CMIP5 models compared relatively well with the observational data sets, with typical discrepancies in the 20% range . Figure 9.37 shows relative errors of CMIP5 models	0
for five precipitation-related indices. Darker grey shadings in the RMSE columns for precipitation indicate larger discrepancies between models and reanalyses for precipitation extremes in general. Sillmann et al.  found that the CMIP5 models tend to simulate more intense precipitation and fewer consecutive wet days than the CMIP3, and thus are closer to the observationally based indices. It is known from sensitivity studies that simulated extreme precipitation is strongly dependent on model resolution. Growing evidence has shown that high-resolution models  can reproduce the observed intensity of extreme precipitation , though some of these results are based on models with observationally constrained surface or lateral boundary conditions  or Regional Climate Models ). In terms of historical trends, a detection and attribution study by Min et al.  found consistency in sign between the observed increase in heavy precipitation over NH land areas in the second half of the 20th century and that simulated by CMIP3 models, but they found that the models tend to underestimate the magnitude of the trend . Related to this, it has been pointed out from comparisons to satellite-based data sets that the majority of models underestimate the sensitivity of extreme precipitation intensity to temperature in the tropics  and globally . O'Gorman  showed that this implies possible underestimation of the projected future increase in extreme precipitation in the tropics.	0
9.5.4.3 Tropical Cyclones It was concluded in the AR4 that high-resolution AGCMs generally reproduced the frequency and distribution, but underestimated intensity of tropical cyclones . Since then, Mizuta et al.  have shown that a newer version of the MRI-AGCM with improved parameterizations  simulates tropical cyclones as intense as those observed with improved distribution as well. Another remarkable finding since the AR4 is that the observed year-to-year count variability of Atlantic hurricanes can be well simulated by modestly high resolution  AGCMs forced by observed SST, though with less skill in other basins . Vortices that have some characteristics of tropical cyclones can also be detected and tracked in AOGCMs in CMIP3 and 5, but their intensities are generally too weak .	0

Note that, as these indices essentially represent changes relative to the base period, they are particularly suitable for being shown in time series and not straightforward for being shown in .	0
tend to simulate more intense and thus more realistic precipitation extremes than CMIP3, which could be partly due to generally higher horizontal resolution. There is medium evidence and high agreement that CMIP3 models tend to underestimate the sensitivity of extreme precipitation intensity to temperature. There is medium evidence and high agreement that high resolution  AGCMs tend to simulate the intensity of extreme precipitation comparable to observational estimates. There is medium evidence and high agreement that year-to-year count variability of Atlantic hurricanes can be well simulated by modestly high resolution  AGCMs forced by observed SSTs. There is medium evidence and medium agreement  that the intensity of tropical cyclones is too weak in CMIP3 and CMIP5 models. Finally, there is medium evidence  and medium agreement  that models can simulate aspects of largescale drought.	0
Box 9.3 | Understanding Model Performance This Box provides a synthesis of findings on understanding model performance based on the model evaluations discussed in this chapter. Uncertainty in Process Representation Some model errors can be traced to uncertainty in representation of processes . Some of these are long-standing issues in climate modelling, reflecting our limited, though gradually increasing, understanding of very complex processes and the inherent challenges in mathematically representing them. For the atmosphere, cloud processes, including convection and its interaction with boundary layer and larger-scale circulation, remain major sources of uncertainty . These in turn cause errors or uncertainties in radiation which propagate through the coupled climate system. Distribution of aerosols is also a source of uncertainty arising from modelled microphysical processes and transport . Ocean models are subject to uncertainty in parameterizations of vertical and horizontal mixing and convection , and ocean errors in turn affect the atmosphere through resulting SST biases. Simulation of sea ice is also affected by errors in both the atmosphere and the ocean as well as the parameterization of sea ice itself . With respect to biogeochemical components in Earth System Models , parameterizations of nitrogen limitation and forest fires are thought to be important for simulating the carbon cycle, but very few ESMs incorporate these so far . Error Propagation Causes of one model bias can sometimes be associated with another. Although the root cause of those biases is often unclear, knowledge of the causal chain or a set of interrelated biases can provide a key to further understanding and improvement of model performance. For example, biases in storm track position are partly due to a SST biases in the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Current . Some biases in variability or trend can be partly traced back to biases in mean states. The decreasing trend in September Arctic ice extent tends to be underestimated when sea ice thickness is overestimated . In such cases, improvement of the mean state may improve simulated variability or trend. Sensitivity to Resolution Some phenomena or aspects of climate are found to be better simulated with models run at higher horizontal and/or vertical resolution. In particular, increased resolution in the atmosphere has improved, at least in some models, storm track and extratropical cyclones , diurnal variation of precipitation over land , extreme precipitation, and tropical cyclone intensity and structure . Similarly, increased horizontal resolution in the ocean is shown to improve sea surface height variability, western boundary currents, tropical instability waves and coastal upwelling , and variability of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation . High vertical resolution and a high model top, as well as high horizontal resolution, are important for simulating lower stratospheric climate variability , blocking , the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation .  809	0
Uncertainty in Observational Data In some cases, insufficient length or quality of observational data makes model evaluation challenging, and is a frequent problem in the evaluation of simulated variability or trends. This is evident for evaluation of upper tropical tropospheric temperature, tropical atmospheric circulation , the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation . Data quality has been pointed out as an issue for arctic cloud properties , ocean heat content, heat and fresh water fluxes over the ocean  and extreme precipitation . Palaeoclimate reconstructions also have large inherent uncertainties . It is clear therefore that updated or newly available data affect model evaluation conclusions. Other Factors Model evaluation can be affected by how models are forced. Uncertainties in specified greenhouse gases, aerosols emissions, land use change, etc. will all affect model results and hence evaluation of model quality. Different statistical methods used in model evaluation can also lead to subtle or substantive differences in the assessment of model quality.	0
9.6.1.1 Regional-Scale Simulation by Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models A comparison of CMIP3 and CMIP5 seasonal cycles of temperature and precipitation for different regions  shows that temperature is generally better simulated than precipitation in terms of the amplitude and phase of the seasonal cycle. The multi-model mean is closer to observations than most of the individual models. The systematic difference between the CMIP5 and CMIP3 ensembles is small in most regions, although there is evident improvement in South Asia  and Tropical South America  in the rainy seasons. In some cases the spread amongst observational estimates can be of comparable magnitude to the model spread, e.g., winter in the Europe and Mediterranean  region. There are as yet rather few published studies in which regional behaviour of the CMIP5 models is evaluated in great detail. Cattiaux et al.  obtained results for Europe similar to those discussed above. Joetzjer et al.  considered 13 models that participated in both CMIP3 and in CMIP5 and found that the seasonal cycle of precipitation over the Amazon improved in the latter. Based on the CMIP archives, regional biases in seasonal and annual mean temperature and precipitation are shown for several land 810	0
regions in Figure 9.39, and for polar and oceanic regions in Figure 9.40. The CMIP5 median temperature biases range from about -3C to 1.5C. Substantial cold biases over NH regions are more prevalent in winter  than summer . The median biases appear in most cases slightly less negative for CMIP5 than CMIP3. The spread amongst models, as characterized by the 25 to 75% and 5 to 95% ranges, is slightly reduced from CMIP3 to CMIP5 in a majority of the regions and is roughly 3C. The RMS error of individual CMIP5 models is smaller than that for CMIP3 in 24 of the 26 regions in Figure 9.39 in DJF, JJA and the annual mean. The absolute value of the ensemble mean bias has also been reduced in most cases. The inter-model spread remains large, particularly in high-latitude regions in winter and in regions with steep orography . The inter-model temperature spread has decreased from CMIP3 to CMIP5 over most of the oceans and over the Arctic and Antarctic land regions. The cold winter bias over the Arctic has been reduced. There is little systematic inter-ensemble difference in temperature over lower latitude oceans. Biases in seasonal total precipitation are shown in the right column of Figures 9.39 and 9.40 for the NH winter  and summer  half years as well as the annual mean. The largest systematic biases over land regions occur in ALA, WSA and TIB, where the annual precipitation exceeds that observed in all CMIP5 models, with a median bias on the order of 100%. All these regions are characterized by high orography and / or a large fraction of solid precipitation, both of which are expected to introduce a negative bias in gauge-based precipitation  that may amplify the model-observation discrepancy. A large negative relative bias in SAH occurs in October to March, but it is of negligible magnitude in absolute terms. In nearly all other seasonal and regional cases over land, the observational estimate falls within the range of the CMIP5 simulations. Compared with CMIP3, the CMIP5 median precipitation is slightly higher in most regions. In contrast with temperature, the seasonal and annual mean ensemble mean and the rootmean square precipitation biases are larger for CMIP5 than for CMIP3 in a slight majority of land regions  and in most of the	0

oceans and less over many high-latitude regions . Over most low-latitude ocean regions, annual precipitation in most CMIP3 and CMIP5 models exceeds GPCP. The difference relative to CMAP is smaller although mostly of the same sign. In Arctic and Antarctic Ocean areas, simulated precipitation is much above CMAP, but more similar to GPCP. Over Antarctic land, precipitation in most models is below CMAP, but close to or above GPCP. Continental to sub-continental mean values may not be representative for smaller-scale biases, as biases generally increase with decreasing spatial averaging . A typical order of magnitude for grid-box-scale annual mean biases in individual CMIP3 models was 2C for temperature and 1 mm day-1 for precipitation , with some geographical variation. This has been noted also in studies on how much spatial averaging would be needed in order to filter out the most unreliable small-scale features . In order to reduce such errors while still retaining information on small scales, Masson and Knutti  found, depending on the variable and the region, that smoothing needed to vary from the gridpoint scale to around 2000 km. On the whole, based on analysis of both ensemble means and inter-model spread, there is high confidence that the CMIP5 models simulate regional-scale temperature distributions somewhat better than the CMIP3 models did. This improvement is evident for most regions. For precipitation, there is medium confidence that there is no systematic change in model performance. In many regions, precipitation biases relative to CRU TS 3.10.01 and GPCP  are larger for CMIP5 than for CMIP3, but given observational uncertainty, the two ensembles are broadly similar.	0

Stand-alone global atmospheric models  run at higher resolution than AOGCMs provide complementary regional-scale climate information, sometimes referred to as `global downscaling'. One important example of this is the simulation of tropical cyclones . A number of advantages of high-resolution AGCMs have been identified, including improved regional precipitation  and blocking . As AGCMs do not simulate interactions with the ocean, their ability to capture some high-resolution phenomena, such as the cold wake in the surface ocean after a tropical cyclone, is limited . As in lower-resolution models, performance is affected by the quality of physical parameterizations .	0
Regional Climate Models  are applied over a limited-area domain with boundary conditions either from global reanalyses or global climate model output. The use of RCMs for `dynamical downscaling' has grown since the AR4, their resolution has increased, process-descriptions have developed further, new components have been added, and coordinated experimentation has become more widespread . Statistical downscaling  involves deriving empirical relationships linking large-scale atmospheric variables  and local/regional climate variables . These relationships may then be applied to equivalent predictors from global models. SD methods have also been applied to RCM output . A significant constraint in a comprehensive evaluation of regional downscaling is that available studies often involve different methods, regions, periods and observational data for evaluation. Thus, evaluation results are difficult to generalize.	0
9.6.2.1 Recent Developments of Statistical Methods The development of SD since the AR4 has been quite vigorous , and many state-of-the-art approaches combine different methods . There is an increasing number of studies on extremes , and on features such as hurricanes , river flow and discharge, sediment, soil erosion and crop yields . Techniques have also been developed to consider multiple climatic variables simultaneously in order to preserve some physical consistency . The methods used to evaluate SD approaches vary with the downscaled variable and include metrics related to intensities , temporal behaviour , and physical processes . SD capabilities are also examined through secondary variables like runoff, river discharge and stream flow .	0
Downscaling skill varies with location, season, parameter and boundary conditions  . Although there are indications that model skill increases with higher resolution, it does not do so linearly. Rojas  found more improvement when increasing resolution from 135 km to 45 km than from 45 km to 15 km. Walther et al.  found that the diurnal precipitation cycle and light precipitation improved more when going from 12 km to 6 km resolution than when going from 50 km to 25 km or from 25 km to 12 km. Higher resolution does enable better simulation of extremes . For example, Pryor et al.  noted that an increase in RCM resolution from 50 km to 6 km increased extreme wind speeds more than the mean wind speed. Kawazoe and Gutowski  compared six RCMs and the two GCMs to high resolution observations, concluding that precipitation extremes were more representative in the RCMs than in the GCMs. Vautard et al.  found that warm extremes in Europe were generally better simulated in RCMs with 12 km resolution compared to 50 km. Kendon et al.  and Chan et al.  found mixed results in daily precipitation simulated at 12 km and 1.5 km resolution, although the latter had improved sub-daily features, perhaps as convection could be explicitly resolved. Coupled RCMs, with an interactive ocean, offer further improvements. Doscher et al.  reproduced empirical relationships between Arctic sea ice extent and sea ice thickness and NAO in a coupled RCM. Zou and Zhou  found that a regional ocean-atmosphere model improved the simulation of precipitation over the western North Pacific compared to an uncoupled model. Samuelsson et al.  showed that coupling a lake model with an RCM captured the effect of lakes on the air temperature over adjacent land. Lenaerts et al.  added drifting snow in an RCM run for the Antarctica, which increased the area of ablation and improved the fit to observations. Smith et al.  added vegetation dynamics-ecosystem biogeochemistry into an RCM, and found some evidence of local feedback to air temperature. Applying an RCM developed for a specific region to other regions exposes it to a wider range of conditions and therefore provides an	0
opportunity for more rigorous evaluation. Transferability experiments target this by running RCMs for different regions while holding their process-descriptions constant . Suh et al.  noted that 10 RCMs run for Africa did well overall for average and maximum temperature, but systematically overestimated the daily minimum temperature. Precipitation was generally simulated betted for wet regions than for dry regions. Similarly, Nikulin et al.  reported on 10 RCMs over Africa, run with boundary conditions from ERA-Interim, and evaluated against different observational data sets. Many of the RCMs simulated precipitation better than the ERA-Interim reanalysis itself. Christensen et al.  examined a range metrics related to simulation of extremes, mesoscale features, trends, aspects of variability and consistency with the driving boundary conditions. Only one of these metrics led to clear differentiation among RCMs . This may imply a general skilfulness of models, but may also simply indicate that the metrics were not very informative. Nevertheless, using some of these metrics, Coppola et al.  and Kjellstrom et al.  found that weighted sets of RCMs outperformed sets without weighting for both temperature and precipitation. Sobolowski and Pavelsky  demonstrated a similar impact.	0
RCMs are regularly tested to evaluate whether they show improvements over global models , that is, whether they do indeed `add value'. In essence, added value is a measure of the extent to which the downscaled climate is closer to observations than the model from which the boundary conditions were obtained. Differences between RCM and GCM simulations are not always very obvious for time-averaged quantities on larger scales or in fairly homogeneous regions. RCM fields are, however, richer in spatial and temporal detail. Indeed, the added value of RCMs is mainly expected in the simulation of topography-influenced phenomena and extremes with relatively small spatial or short temporal character . As an example, RCM downscaling led to better large-scale monsoon precipitation patterns  for East Asia than in the global models used for boundary conditions. In the few instances where RCMs have been interactively coupled to global models , the effects of improved small scales propagate to larger scales and this has been found to improve the simulation of larger scale phenomena . Other examples include improved simulation of convective precipitation , near-surface temperature , near-surface temperature and wind , temperature and precipitation , extreme precipitation , coastal climate features , Atlantic hurricanes , European storm damage , strong mesoscale cyclones , cutoff lows , polar lows  and higher statistical moments of the water budget .	0
In addition to issues related to resolution and model complexity , errors and uncertainties arise from observational uncertainty in evaluation data and parameterizations , choice of model domain and application of boundary conditions . In the case of SD, sources of model errors and uncertainties depend on the choice of method, including the choice of the predictors, the estimation of empirical relationships between predictors and predictands from limited data sets, and also the data used to estimate the predictors . There are numerous different SD methods, and the findings are difficult to generalize. Small domains allow less freedom for RCMs to generate the small-scale features that give rise to added value . Therefore large domains -covering entire continents- have become more common. Koltzow et al.  found improvements with the use of a larger domain, but the RCM solution can become increasingly `decoupled' from the driving data , which can introduce inconsistencies. Large domains also introduce large internal variability, which can significantly contaminate interannual variability of seasonal means . Techniques such as spectral nudging  can be used to constrain such inconsistencies . Winterfeldt and Weisse  concluded that nudging improved the simulation of marine wind climate, while Otte et al.  demonstrated improvements in temperature and precipitation. Nudging may, however, also lead to deterioration of features such as precipitation extremes . Veljovic et al.  showed that an RCM can in fact improve the large scales with respect to those inherent in the boundary conditions, and argued that nudging may be undesirable. The quality of RCM results may vary according to the synoptic situation, season, and the geographic location of the lateral boundaries . In addition to lateral boundary conditions, RCMs also need sea surface information. Few studies have explored the dependency of RCM results on the treatment of the SSTs and sea ice, although Koltzow et al.  found that the specification of SSTs was less influential than was the domain or the lateral boundaries. Woollings et al.  investigated the effect of specified SST on the simulation of the Atlantic storm track and found that it was better simulated with high-resolution SSTs, whereas increasing temporal resolution gave mixed results. As is the case in global models, RCM errors are directly related to shortcomings in process parameterizations. Examples include the 815	0
A fundamental issue is how the performance of a downscaling method relates to its ability to provide credible future projections . This subject is discussed further in Section 9.8. The credibility of downscaled information of course depends on the quality of the downscaling method itself , and on the quality of the global climate models providing the large-scale boundary conditions . Specific to SD is the statistical stationarity hypothesis, that is, that the relationships inferred from historical data remain valid under a changing climate . Vecchi et al.  note that a statistical method that captures interannual hurricane variability gives very different results for projections compared to RCMs. Such results suggest that good performance of statistical downscaling as assessed against observations does not guarantee credible regional climate information. Some recent studies have proposed ways to evaluate SD approaches	0
using RCM outputs  or long series of observations . Giorgi and Coppola  argued that regional-scale climate projections over land in the CMIP3 models were not sensitive to their temperature biases. For precipitation, the same was found for about two thirds of the global land area. However, there is some recent evidence that regional biases may be nonlinear for temperature extremes  in both global and regional models. A mechanism at play may be that models tend to dry out the soil too effectively at high temperatures, which can lead to systematic biases in projected warm summertime conditions . This is illustrated in Figure 9.41 for the Mediterranean region, which suggests a tendency in RCMs, CMIP3 and CMIP5 models towards an enhanced warm bias in the warmer months. The implication is that the typically large warming signal in these regions could be biased . Findings such as these stress the importance of a thorough assessment of models' biases when they are applied for projections . Di Luca et al.  analysed downscaled climate change projections from six RCMs run over North America. The climate change signals for seasonal precipitation and temperature were similar to those in the driving AOGCMs, and the spatial detail gained by downscaling was comparable in both present and future climate. Deque et al.  studied projections with several combinations of AOGCM and RCM for Europe. A larger part of the spread in winter temperature and	0
Equilibrium climate sensitivity  is the equilibrium change in global and annual mean surface air temperature after doubling the atmospheric concentration of CO2 relative to pre-industrial levels. In the AR4, the range in equilibrium climate sensitivity of the CMIP3 models was 2.1C to 4.4C, and the single largest contributor to this spread was differences among modelled cloud feedbacks. These assessments carry over to the CMIP5 ensemble without any substantial change . The method of diagnosing climate sensitivity in CMIP5 differs fundamentally from the method employed in CMIP3 and assessed in the AR4 . In CMIP3, an AGCM was coupled to a non-dynamic mixed-layer  ocean model with prescribed ocean heat transport convergence. CO2 concentration was then instantaneously doubled, and the model was integrated to a new equilibrium with unchanged implied ocean heat transport. While computationally efficient, this method had the disadvantage of employing a different	0
model from that used for the historical simulations and climate projections. However, in the few comparisons that were made, the resulting disagreement in ECS was less than about 10% . In CMIP5, climate sensitivity is diagnosed directly from the AOGCMs following the approach of Gregory et al. . In this case the CO2 concentration is instantaneously quadrupled and kept constant for 150 years of simulation, and both equilibrium climate sensitivity and RF are diagnosed from a linear fit of perturbations in global mean surface temperature to the instantaneous radiative imbalance at the TOA. The transient climate response  is the change in global and annual mean surface temperature from an experiment in which the CO2 concentration is increased by 1% yr-1, and calculated using the difference between the start of the experiment and a 20-year period centred on the time of CO2 doubling. TCR is smaller than ECS because ocean heat uptake delays surface warming. TCR is linearly correlated with ECS in the CMIP5 ensemble , although the relationship may be nonlinear outside the range spanned in Table 9.5 . Based on the methods outlined above and explained in Section 9.7.2 below, Table 9.5 shows effective ERF, ECS, TCR and feedback strengths for the CMIP5 ensemble. The two estimates of ERF agree with each other to within 5% for six models , although the deviation exceeds 10% for four models  and is indicative of deviations from the basic assumptions underlying one or both ERF estimation methods. However, the mean difference of 0.3 W m-2 between the two methods for diagnosing ERF is only about half of the ensemble standard deviation of 0.5 W m-2, or 15% of the mean value for ERF by CO2 using fixed SSTs. ECS and TCR vary across the ensemble by a factor of approximately 2. The multi-model ensemble mean in ECS is 3.2C, a value nearly identical to that for CMIP3, while the CMIP5 ensemble range is 2.1C to 4.7C, a spread which is also nearly indistinguishable from that for CMIP3. While every CMIP5 model whose heritage can	0

ERF, equilibrium climate sensitivity  and transient climate response  are based on Andrews et al.  and Forster et al.  and updated from the CMIP5 archive. The ERF entries are calculated according to Hansen et al.  using fixed sea surface temperatures  and Gregory et al.  using regression. ECS is calculated using regressions following Gregory et al. . TCR is calculated from the CMIP5 simulations with 1% CO2 increase per year , using the 20-year mean centred on the year of CO2 doubling. The climate sensitivity parameter and its inverse, the climate feedback parameter, are calculated from the regression-based ERF and the ECS. Strengths of the individual feedbacks are taken from Vial et al. , following Soden et al.  and using radiative kernel methods with two different kernels. The sign convention is such that a positive entry for an individual feedback marks a positive feedback; the sum of individual feedback strengths must hence be multiplied by -1 to make it comparable to the climate feedback parameter. The entries for radiative forcing and equilibrium climate sensitivity were obtained by dividing by two the original results, which were obtained for CO2 quadrupling.

be traced to CMIP3 shows some change in ECS, there is no discernible systematic tendency. This broad similarity between CMIP3 and CMIP5 and the good agreement between different methods where they were applied to the same atmospheric GCM indicate that the uncertainty in methodology is minor compared to the overall spread in ECS. The change in TCR from CMIP3 to CMIP5 is generally of the same sign but of smaller magnitude compared to the change in ECS. The relationship between ECS and an estimates derived from total feedbacks are discussed in Section 9.7.2. Although ECS can vary with global mean surface temperature owing to the temperature dependencies of the various feedbacks , Figure 9.42 shows no discernible correlation for the CMIP5 historical temperature ranges, a fact that suggests that ECS is less sensitive to errors in the current climate than to other sources of uncertainty.	0
In perturbed ensembles of three different models, the primary cloud-related factor contributing to the spread in equilibrium climate sensitivity is the low-level shortwave cloud feedback . Changes in the high-altitude clouds also induce climate feedbacks due to the large areal extent and significant longwave cloud radiative effects of tropical convective cloud systems. In experiments with perturbed physics ensembles of AOGCMs, the parameterization of ice fall speed also emerges as one of the most important determinants of climate sensitivity . Other non-microphysical feedback mechanisms are detailed in Chapter 7. Cloud feedbacks in AOGCMs are generally positive or near neutral , as evidenced by the net positive or neutral cloud feedbacks in all of the models examined in a multi-thousand member ensemble of AOGCMs constructed by parameter perturbations . The sign of cloud feedbacks in the current climate deduced from observed relationships between SSTs and TOA radiative fluxes are discussed further in Section 7.2.5.7.	0
9.7.2.4 Relationship of Feedbacks to Modelled Climate Sensitivity The ECS can be estimated from the ratio of forcing to the total climate feedback parameter. This approach is applicable to simulations in which the net radiative balance is much smaller than the forcing and hence the modelled climate system is essentially in equilibrium. This approach can also serve to check the internal consistency of estimates of the ECS, forcing, and feedback parameters obtained using independent methods. The relationship between ECS from Andrews et al.  and estimates of ECS obtained from the ratio of forcings to feedbacks is shown in Figure 9.43b. The forcings are estimated using both regression and fixed SST techniques  by Andrews et al.  and the feedbacks are calculated using radiative kernels . On average, the ECS from forcing to feedback ratios underestimate the ECS from Andrews et al.  by 25% and 35%, or up to 50% for individual models, using fixed-SST and regression forcings, respectively.	0
9.7.2.5 Relationship of Feedbacks to Uncertainty in Modelled Climate Sensitivity Objective methods for perturbing uncertain model parameters to optimize performance relative to a set of observational metrics have shown a tendency toward an increase in the mean and a narrowing of the spread of estimated climate sensitivity . This tendency is opposed by the effects of structural biases related to incomplete process representations in GCMs. If common structural biases are replicated across models in a MME , the most likely sensitivity for the MME tends to shift towards lower sensitivities while the possibility of larger sensitivities increases at the 820	0
Despite the range in equilibrium sensitivity of 2.1C to 4.4C for CMIP3 models, they reproduce the global surface air temperature anomaly of 0.76C over 1850-2005 to within 25% relative error. The relatively small range of historical climate response suggests that there is another mechanism, for example a compensating non-GHG forcing, present in the historical simulations that counteracts the relatively large range in sensitivity obtained from idealized experiments forced only by increasing CO2. One possible mechanism is a systematic negative correlation across the multi-model ensemble between ECS and anthropogenic aerosol forcing . A second possible mechanism is a systematic overestimate of the mixing between the oceanic mixed layer and the full depth ocean underneath . However, despite the same range of ECS in the CMIP5 models as in the CMIP3 models, there is no significant relationship across the CMIP5 ensemble between ECS and the 20th-century ERF applied to each individual model . This indicates a lesser role of compensating ERF trends from GHGs and aerosols in CMIP5 historical simulations than in CMIP3. Differences in ocean heat uptake also do not appreciably affect the spread in projected changes in global mean temperature by 2095 .	0

shown to scale well with climate sensitivity because the signal is mostly dominated by CO2 forcing in these regions . The analogy between the LGM climate sensitivity and future climate sensitivity is, however, not perfect . In a single-model ensemble of simulations, the magnitudes of the LGM cooling and the warming induced by a doubling of CO2 are nonlinear in the forcings applied . Differences in the cloud radiative feedback are at the origin of this asymmetric response to equivalent positive and negative forcings . There is thus still low confidence that the regional LGM model-data comparisons can be used to evaluate model climate sensitivity. However, even if the results do not scale perfectly with equilibrium or transient climate sensitivity, the LGM simulations allow the identification of the different feedback factors that contributed to the LGM global cooling  and model spread in these feedbacks. The largest spread in LGM model feedbacks is found for the shortwave cloud feedback, just as for the modern climate. This correspondence between LGM and modern climates adds to the high confidence that the shortwave cloud feedback is the dominant source of model spread in climate sensitivity .	0
are therefore of limited value to further constrain climate sensitivity or TCR. The assessed literature suggests that the range of climate sensitivities and transient responses covered by CMIP3/5 cannot be narrowed significantly by constraining the models with observations of the mean climate and variability, consistent with the difficulty of constraining the cloud feedbacks from observations . Studies based on PPE and CMIP3 support the conclusion that a credible representation of the mean climate and variability is very difficult to achieve with equilibrium climate sensitivities below 2C . High climate sensitivity values above 5C  are found in the PPE based on HadAM/HadCM3. Several recent studies find that such high values cannot be excluded based on climatological constraints, but comparison with observations shows the smallest errors for many fields if ECS is between 3 and 4C .	0
evidence includes the number of studies and quality of observational data. Generally, evidence is most robust when there are multiple, independent studies that evaluate multiple models using high-quality observations. The degree of agreement measures whether different studies come to the same conclusions or not. The figure shows that several important aspects of the climate are simulated well by contemporary models, with varying levels of confidence. The colour coding provides an indication of how model quality has changed from CMIP3 to CMIP5. For example, there is high confidence that the model performance for global mean surface air temperature  is high, and it is shown in green because there is robust evidence of improvement since CMIP3. By contrast, the diurnal cycle of global mean surface air temperature  is simulated with medium performance, but there is low confidence in this assessment owing to as yet limited analyses.

FAQ 9.1 | Are Climate Models Getting Better, and How Would We Know? Climate models are extremely sophisticated computer programs that encapsulate our understanding of the climate system and simulate, with as much fidelity as currently feasible, the complex interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, snow and ice, the global ecosystem and a variety of chemical and biological processes. The complexity of climate models--the representation of physical processes like clouds, land surface interactions and the representation of the global carbon and sulphur cycles in many models--has increased substantially since the IPCC First Assessment Report in 1990, so in that sense, current Earth System Models are vastly `better' than the models of that era. This development has continued since the Fourth Assessment, while other factors have also contributed to model improvement. More powerful supercomputers allow current models to resolve finer spatial detail. Today's models also reflect improved understanding of how climate processes work--understanding that has come from ongoing research and analysis, along with new and improved observations.	0
Quantifying model performance is a topic that has featured in all previous IPCC Working Group I Reports. Reading back over these earlier assessments provides a general sense of the improvements that have been made. Past reports have typically provided a rather broad survey of model performance, showing differences between model-calculated versions of various climate quantities and corresponding observational estimates. Inevitably, some models perform better than others for certain climate variables, but no individual model clearly emerges as `the best' overall. Recently, there has been progress in computing various performance metrics, which synthesize model performance relative to a range of different observations according to a simple numerical score. Of course, the definition of such a score, how it is computed, the observations used 	0
An important consideration is that model performance can be evaluated only relative to past observations, taking into account natural internal variability. To have confidence in the future projections of such models, historical climate--and its variability and change--must be well simulated. The scope of model evaluation, in terms of the kind and quantity of observations available, the availability of better coordinated model experiments, and the expanded use of various performance metrics, has provided much more quantitative information about model performance. But this alone may not be sufficient. Whereas weather and seasonal climate predictions can be regularly verified, climate projections spanning a century or more cannot. This is particularly the case as anthropogenic forcing is driving the climate system toward conditions not previously observed in the instrumental record, and it will always be a limitation.	0
own uncertainties), and the manner in which various scores are combined are all important, and will affect the end result. Nevertheless, if the metric is computed consistently, one can compare different generations of models. Results of such comparisons generally show that, although each generation exhibits a range in performance, the average model performance index has improved steadily between each generation. An example of changes in model performance over time is shown in FAQ 9.1, Figure 1, and illustrates the ongoing, albeit modest, improvement. It is interesting to note that both the poorest and best performing models demonstrate improvement, and that this improvement comes in parallel with increasing model complexity and an elimination of artificial adjustments to atmosphere and ocean coupling . Some of the reasons for this improvement include increased understanding of various climate processes and better representation of these processes in climate models. More comprehensive Earth observations are also driving improvements.	0
The evaluation of model simulations of historical climate is of direct relevance to detection and attribution  studies  since these rely on model-derived patterns  of climate response to external forcing, and on the ability of models to simulate decadal and longer-time scale internal variability . Conversely, D&A research contributes to model evaluation through estimation of the amplitude of modeled response to various forcings . The estimated fingerprint for some variables such as water vapor is governed by basic physical processes that are well represented in models and are rather insensitive to model uncertainties . Figure 9.44 illustrates slight improvements in the representation of some of the modes of variability and climate phenomena discussed in Sections 9.5.2 and 9.5.3, suggesting with medium confidence that models now better reproduce internal variability. On the other hand, biases that affect D&A studies remain. An example is the warm bias of lower-stratosphere temperature trends during the satellite period  that can be linked to uncertainties in stratospheric ozone forcing . Recent studies of climate extremes  also provide evidence that models have reasonable skill in these important attributes of a changing climate; however, there is an indication that models have difficulties in reproducing the right balance between historical changes in cold and warm extremes. They also confirm that resolution affects the confidence that can be placed in the analyses of extreme in precipitation. D&A studies focussed on extreme events are therefore constrained by current model limitations. Lastly, some D&A studies have incorporated model quality results by repeating a multi-model analysis with only the models that agree best with observations . This model discrimination or weighting is less problematic for D&A analysis than it is for model projections	0
Confidence in climate model projections is based on physical understanding of the climate system and its representation in climate models, and on a demonstration of how well models represent a wide range of processes and climate characteristics on various spatial and temporal scales . A climate model's credibility is increased if the model is able to simulate past variations in climate, such as trends over the 20th century and palaeoclimatic changes. Projections from previous IPCC assessments can also be directly compared to observations , with the caveat that these projections were not intended to be predictions over the short time scales for which observations are available to date. Unlike shorter lead forecasts, longer-term climate change projections push models into conditions outside the range observed in the historical period used for evaluation. In some cases, the spread in climate projections can be reduced by weighting of models according to their ability to reproduce past observed climate. Several studies have explored the use of unequally weighted means, with the weights based on the models' performance in simulating past variations in climate, typically using some performance metric or collection of metrics . When applied to projections of Arctic sea ice, averages in which extra weight is given 825	0
There are several encouraging examples of `emergent constraints', which are relationships across an ensemble of models between some aspect of Earth System sensitivity and an observable trend or variation in the contemporary climate . For example, analyzing the CMIP3 ensemble, Hall and Qu  showed that inter-model variations of snow albedo feedback in the contemporary seasonal cycle strongly correlate with comparably large inter-model variations in this feedback under future climate change. An update of this analysis with CMIP5 models added is shown in Figure 9.45 . This relationship presumably arises from the fact that surface albedo values in areas covered by snow vary widely across the models, particularly in the heavily vegetated boreal forest zone. Models with higher surface albedos in these areas have a larger contrast between snow-covered and snow-free areas, and hence a stronger snow albedo feedback whether the context is the seasonal	0
variation in sunshine or anthropogenic forcing. Comparison with an observational estimate of snow albedo feedback reveals a large spread with both high and low biases. The right panel of Figure 9.45 shows another example of an emergent constraint, where the sensitivity of tropical land carbon to warming  is related to the sensitivity of the annual CO2 growth rate to tropical temperature anomalies  ). The horizontal axis is the regression of the atmospheric CO2 growth rate on the tropical temperature anomaly for each model. The strong statistical relationship between these two variables is consistent with the fact that interannual variability in the CO2 growth-rate is known to be dominated by the response of tropical land to climatic anomalies, associated particularly with ENSO. Thus the relationship has a physical as well as a statistical basis. The interannual sensitivity of the CO2 growth rate to tropical temperature can be estimated from observational data. Like the snow albedo feedback example, this intermodel relationship provides a credible means to reduce model spread in the sensitivity of tropical land carbon to tropical climate change. On the other hand, many studies have failed to find strong relationships between observables and projections. Whetton et al.  and Knutti et al.  found that correlations between local to regional climatological values and projected changes are small except for a few regions. Scherrer  finds no robust relationship between the ability of the CMIP3 models to represent interannual variability of near-surface air temperature and the amplitude of future warming.Raisanen et al.  report only small  reductions in cross-validation error of simulated 21st century temperature changes when weighting the CMIP3 models based on their simulation of the present-day climatology.

many observed variables, short time series for observed trends, lack of correlation between observed quantities and projected past or future trends, and systematic errors in the models , the ambiguity of possible performance metrics and the difficulty of associating them with predictive skill . Emergent constraints can be difficult to identify if climate models are structurally similar and share common biases, thereby reducing the effective ensemble size. Comparison of emergent constraints in MMEs from different modelling experiments can help reveal which constraints are robust . Another issue is that testing of large numbers of predictors will find statistically significant correlations that do not remain significant in a different ensemble. This is particularly important if many predictors are tested using only small ensembles like CMIP3 . All of these potential pitfalls underscore the need for analysis of the mechanism underpinning the statistical relationship between current and future climate parameters for any proposed emergent constraint.	0
Executive Summary Atmospheric Temperatures More than half of the observed increase in global mean surface temperature  from 1951 to 2010 is very likely1 due to the observed anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas  concentrations. The consistency of observed and modeled changes across the climate system, including warming of the atmosphere and ocean, sea level rise, ocean acidification and changes in the water cycle, the cryosphere and climate extremes points to a large-scale warming resulting primarily from anthropogenic increases in GHG concentrations. Solar forcing is the only known natural forcing acting to warm the climate over this period but it has increased much less than GHG forcing, and the observed pattern of long-term tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling is not consistent with the expected response to solar irradiance variations. The Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation  could be a confounding influence but studies that find a significant role for the AMO show that this does not project strongly onto 1951-2010 temperature trends. It is virtually certain that internal variability alone cannot account for the observed global warming since 1951. The observed global-scale warming since 1951 is large compared to climate model estimates of internal variability on 60-year time scales. The	0
The observed recent warming hiatus, defined as the reduction in GMST trend during 1998-2012 as compared to the trend during 1951-2012, is attributable in roughly equal measure to a cooling contribution from internal variability and a reduced trend in external forcing . The forcing trend reduction is primarily due to a negative forcing trend from both volcanic eruptions and the downward phase of the solar cycle. However, there is low confidence in quantifying the role of forcing trend in causing the hiatus because of uncertainty in the magnitude of the volcanic forcing trends and low confidence in the aerosol forcing trend. Many factors, in addition to GHGs, including changes in tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols, stratospheric water vapour, and solar output, as well as internal modes of variability, contribute to the year-to-year and decade- to-decade variability of GMST. 	0
It is very likely that anthropogenic forcings have made a substantial contribution to upper ocean warming  observed since the 1970s. This anthropogenic ocean warming has contributed to global sea level rise over this period through thermal expansion. New understanding since AR4 of measurement errors and their correction in the temperature data sets have increased the agreement in estimates of ocean warming. Observations of ocean warming are consistent with climate model simulations that include anthropogenic and volcanic forcings but are inconsistent with simulations that exclude anthropogenic forcings. Simulations that include both anthropogenic and natural forcings have decadal variability that is consistent with observations. These results are a major advance on AR4. 	0
There has been a strengthening of the evidence for human influence on temperature extremes since the AR4 and IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation  reports. It is very likely that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to the observed changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century. Attribution of changes in temperature extremes to anthropogenic influence is robustly seen in independent analyses using different methods and different data sets. It is likely that human influence has substantially increased the probability of occurrence of heatwaves in some locations. 	0
The extended record of observed climate change has allowed a better characterization of the basic properties of the climate system that have implications for future warming. New evidence from 21st century observations and stronger evidence from a wider range of studies have strengthened the constraint on the transient climate response  which is estimated with high confidence to be likely between 1C and 2.5C and extremely unlikely to be greater than 3C. The Transient Climate Response to Cumulative CO2 Emissions  is estimated with high confidence to be likely between 0.8C and 2.5C per 1000 PgC for cumulative CO2 emissions less than about 2000 PgC until the time at which temperatures peak. Estimates of the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity  based on multiple and partly independent lines of evidence from observed climate change indicate that there is high confidence that ECS is extremely unlikely to be less than 1C and medium confidence that the ECS is likely to be between 1.5C and 4.5C and very unlikely greater than 6C. These assessments are consistent with the overall assessment in Chapter 12, where the inclusion of additional lines of evidence increases confidence in the assessed likely range for ECS. 	0
It is likely that human influence has altered sea level pressure patterns globally. Detectable anthropogenic influence on changes in sea level pressure patterns is found in several studies. Changes in atmospheric circulation are important for local climate change since they could lead to greater or smaller changes in climate in a particular region than elsewhere. There is medium confidence that stratospheric ozone depletion has contributed to the observed poleward shift of the southern Hadley Cell border during austral summer. There are large uncertainties in the magnitude of this poleward shift. It is likely that stratospheric ozone depletion has contributed to the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode seen in austral summer since the mid20th century which corresponds to sea level pressure reductions over the high latitudes and an increase in the subtropics. There is medium confidence that GHGs have also played a role in these trends of the southern Hadley Cell border and the Southern Annular Mode in Austral summer. 	0
Human influence has been detected in the major assessed components of the climate system. Taken together, the combined evidence increases the level of confidence in the attribution of observed climate change, and reduces the uncertainties associated with assessment based on a single climate variable. From this combined evidence it is virtually certain that human influence has warmed the global climate system. Anthropogenic influence has been identified in changes in temperature near the surface of the Earth, in the atmosphere and in the oceans, as well as changes in the cryosphere, the water cycle and some extremes. There is strong evidence that excludes solar forcing, volcanoes and internal variability as the strongest drivers of warming since 1950. 	0
Evidence of a human influence on climate has grown stronger over the period of the four previous assessment reports of the IPCC. There was little observational evidence for a detectable human influence on climate at the time of the First IPCC Assessment Report. By the time of the second report there was sufficient additional evidence for it to conclude that `the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate'. The Third Assessment Report found that a distinct greenhouse gas  signal was robustly detected in the observed temperature record and that `most of the observed warming over the last fifty years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.'	0
bution, in which it is necessary to partition the response of the climate system to different forcings, most CMIP5 models include simulations of the response to natural forcings only, and the response to increases in well mixed GHGs only . The advances enabled by this greater wealth of observational and model data are assessed in this chapter. In this assessment, there is increased focus on the extent to which the climate system as a whole is responding in a coherent way across a suite of climate variables such as surface mean temperature, temperature extremes, ocean heat content, ocean salinity and precipitation change. There is also a global to regional perspective, assessing the extent to which not just global mean changes but also spatial patterns of change across the globe can be attributed to anthropogenic and natural forcings.	0
10.2.1 With the additional evidence available by the time of the Fourth Assessment Report, the conclusions were further strengthened. This evidence included a wider range of observational data, a greater variety of more sophisticated climate models including improved representations of forcings and processes and a wider variety of analysis techniques. This enabled the AR4 report to conclude that `most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations'. The AR4 also concluded that `discernible human influences now extend to other aspects of climate, including ocean warming, continental-average temperatures, temperature extremes and wind patterns.' A number of uncertainties remained at the time of AR4. For example, the observed variability of ocean temperatures appeared inconsistent with climate models, thereby reducing the confidence with which observed ocean warming could be attributed to human influence. Also, although observed changes in global rainfall patterns and increases in heavy precipitation were assessed to be qualitatively consistent with expectations of the response to anthropogenic forcings, detection and attribution studies had not been carried out. Since the AR4, improvements have been made to observational data sets, taking more complete account of systematic biases and inhomogeneities in observational systems, further developing uncertainty estimates, and correcting detected data problems . A new set of simulations from a greater number of AOGCMs have been performed as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 . These new simulations have several advantages over the CMIP3 simulations assessed in the AR4 . They incorporate some moderate increases in resolution, improved parameterizations, and better representation of aerosols . Importantly for attri-	0
In IPCC Assessments, detection and attribution involve quantifying the evidence for a causal link between external drivers of climate change and observed changes in climatic variables. It provides the central, although not the only  line of evidence that has supported statements such as `the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate' or `most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.' The definition of detection and attribution used here follows the terminology in the IPCC guidance paper . `Detection of change is defined as the process of demonstrating that climate or a system affected by climate has changed in some defined statistical sense without providing a reason for that change. An identified change is detected in observations if its likelihood of occurrence by chance due to internal variability alone is determined to be small' . Attribution is defined as `the process of evaluating the relative contributions of multiple causal factors to a change or event with an assignment of statistical confidence'. As this wording implies, attribution is more complex than detection, combining statistical analysis with physical understanding . In general, a component of an observed change is attributed to a specific causal factor if the observations can be shown to be consistent with results from a process-based model that includes the causal factor in question, and inconsistent with an alternate, otherwise identical, model that excludes this factor. The evaluation of this consistency in both of these cases takes into account internal chaotic variability and known uncertainties in the observations and responses to external causal factors.	0
Attribution does not require, and nor does it imply, that every aspect of the response to the causal factor in question is simulated correctly. Suppose, for example, the global cooling following a large volcano matches the cooling simulated by a model, but the model underestimates the magnitude of this cooling: the observed global cooling can still be attributed to that volcano, although the error in magnitude would suggest that details of the model response may be unreliable. Physical understanding is required to assess what constitutes a plausible discrepancy above that expected from internal variability. Even with complete consistency between models and data, attribution statements can never be made with 100% certainty because of the presence of internal variability. This definition of attribution can be extended to include antecedent conditions and internal variability among the multiple causal factors contributing to an observed change or event. Understanding the relative importance of internal versus external factors is important in the analysis of individual weather events , but the primary focus of this chapter will be on attribution to factors external to the climate system, like rising GHG levels, solar variability and volcanic activity. There are four core elements to any detection and attribution study: 1. Observations of one or more climate variables, such as surface temperature, that are understood, on physical grounds, to be relevant to the process in question 2. An estimate of how external drivers of climate change have evolved before and during the period under investigation, including both the driver whose influence is being investigated  and potential confounding influences  3. A quantitative physically based understanding, normally encapsulated in a model, of how these external drivers are thought to have affected these observed climate variables 4. An estimate, often but not always derived from a physically based model, of the characteristics of variability expected in these observed climate variables due to random, quasi-periodic and chaotic fluctuations generated in the climate system that are not due to externally driven climate change A climate model driven with external forcing alone is not expected to replicate the observed evolution of internal variability, because of the chaotic nature of the climate system, but it should be able to capture the statistics of this variability . The reliability of forecasts of short-term variability is also a useful test of the representation of relevant processes in the models used for attribution, but forecast skill is not necessary for attribution: attribution focuses on changes in the underlying moments of the `weather attractor', meaning the expected weather and its variability, while prediction focuses on the actual trajectory of the weather around this attractor. In proposing that `the process of attribution requires the detection of a change in the observed variable or closely associated variables' (Hegerl	0
et al., 2010), the new guidance recognized that it may be possible, in some instances, to attribute a change in a particular variable to some external factor before that change could actually be detected in the variable itself, provided there is a strong body of knowledge that links a change in that variable to some other variable in which a change can be detected and attributed. For example, it is impossible in principle to detect a trend in the frequency of 1-in-100-year events in a 100-year record, yet if the probability of occurrence of these events is physically related to large-scale temperature changes, and we detect and attribute a large-scale warming, then the new guidance allows attribution of a change in probability of occurrence before such a change can be detected in observations of these events alone. This was introduced to draw on the strength of attribution statements from, for example, time-averaged temperatures, to attribute changes in closely related variables. Attribution of observed changes is not possible without some kind of model of the relationship between external climate drivers and observable variables. We cannot observe a world in which either anthropogenic or natural forcing is absent, so some kind of model is needed to set up and evaluate quantitative hypotheses: to provide estimates of how we would expect such a world to behave and to respond to anthropogenic and natural forcings . Models may be very simple, just a set of statistical assumptions, or very complex, complete global climate models: it is not necessary, or possible, for them to be correct in all respects, but they must provide a physically consistent representation of processes and scales relevant to the attribution problem in question. One of the simplest approaches to detection and attribution is to compare observations with model simulations driven with natural forcings alone, and with simulations driven with all relevant natural and anthropogenic forcings. If observed changes are consistent with simulations that include human influence, and inconsistent with those that do not, this would be sufficient for attribution providing there were no other confounding influences and it is assumed that models are simulating the responses to all external forcings correctly. This is a strong assumption, and most attribution studies avoid relying on it. Instead, they typically assume that models simulate the shape of the response to external forcings  correctly, but do not assume that models simulate the magnitude of the response correctly. This is justified by our fundamental understanding of the origins of errors in climate modelling. Although there is uncertainty in the size of key forcings and the climate response, the overall shape of the response is better known: it is set in time by the timing of emissions and set in space  by the geography of the continents and differential responses of land and ocean . So-called `fingerprint' detection and attribution studies characterize their results in terms of a best estimate and uncertainty range for `scaling factors' by which the model-simulated responses to individual forcings can be scaled up or scaled down while still remaining consistent with the observations, accounting for similarities between the patterns of response to different forcings and uncertainty due to internal climate variability. If a scaling factor is significantly larger than zero , then the response to that forcing, as simulated by 873	0
that model and given that estimate of internal variability and other potentially confounding responses, is detectable in these observations, whereas if the scaling factor is consistent with unity, then that model-simulated response is consistent with observed changes. Studies do not require scaling factors to be consistent with unity for attribution, but any discrepancy from unity should be understandable in terms of known uncertainties in forcing or response: a scaling factor of 10, for example, might suggest the presence of a confounding factor, calling into question any attribution claim. Scaling factors are estimated by fitting model-simulated responses to observations, so results are unaffected, at least to first order, if the model has a transient climate response, or aerosol forcing, that is too low or high. Conversely, if the spatial or temporal pattern of forcing or response is wrong, results can be affected: see Box 10.1 and further discussion in Section 10.3.1.1 and Hegerl and Zwiers  and Hegerl et al. . Sensitivity of results to the pattern of forcing or response can be assessed by comparing results across multiple models or by representing pattern uncertainty explicitly , but errors that are common to all models  will not be addressed in this way and are accounted for in this assessment by downgrading overall assessed likelihoods to be generally more conservative than the quantitative likelihoods provided by individual studies.	0
Attribution studies must compromise between estimating responses to different forcings separately, which allows for the possibility of different errors affecting different responses , and estimating responses to combined forcings, which typically gives smaller uncertainties because it avoids the issue of `degeneracy': if two responses have very similar shapes in space and time, then it may be impossible to estimate the magnitude of both from a single set of observations because amplification of one may be almost exactly compensated for by amplification or diminution of the other . Many studies find it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the responses to GHG and other anthropogenic forcings separately, particularly when spatial information is included. This is important, because it means the estimated response to GHG increase is not dependent on the uncertain magnitude of forcing and response due to aerosols . The simplest way of fitting model-simulated responses to observations is to assume that the responses to different forcings add linearly, so the response to any one forcing can be scaled up or down without affecting any of the others and that internal climate variability is independent of the response to external forcing. Under these conditions, attribution can be expressed as a variant of linear regression . The additivity assumption has been tested and found to hold for large-scale temperature changes  but it might not hold for other variables like precipitation , nor for regional temperature changes . In principle, additivity is not required for detection and attribution, but to date non-additive approaches have not been widely adopted. The estimated properties of internal climate variability play a central role in this assessment. These are either estimated empirically from the observations  or from paleoclimate reconstructions 874	0
  or derived from control simulations of coupled models . The majority of studies use modelled variability and routinely check that the residual variability from observations is consistent with modelled internal variability used over time scales shorter than the length of the instrumental record . Assessing the accuracy of model-simulated variability on longer time scales using paleoclimate reconstructions is complicated by the fact that some reconstructions may not capture the full spectrum of variability because of limitations of proxies and reconstruction methods, and by the unknown role of external forcing in the pre-instrumental record. In general, however, paleoclimate reconstructions provide no clear evidence either way whether models are over- or underestimating internal variability on time scales relevant for attribution .	0
Some studies attempt to distinguish between externally driven climate change and changes due to internal variability minimizing the use of climate models, for example, by separating signal and noise by time scale , spatial pattern  or both. Other studies use model control simulations to identify patterns of maximum predictability and contrast these with the forced component in climate model simulations : see Section 10.3.1. Conclusions of most studies are consistent with those based on fingerprint detection and attribution, while using a different set of assumptions . A number of studies have applied methods developed in the econometrics literature  to assess the evidence for a causal link between external drivers of climate and observed climate change, using the observations themselves to estimate the expected properties of internal climate variability . The advantage of these approaches is that they do not depend on the accuracy of any complex global climate model, but they nevertheless have to assume some kind of model, or restricted class of models, of the properties of the variables under investigation. Attribution is impossible without a model: although this model may be implicit in the statistical framework used, it is important to assess its physical consistency . Many of these time series methods can be cast in the overall framework of co-integration and error correction , which is an approach to analysing relationships between stationary and non-stationary time series. If there is a consistent causal relationship between two or more possibly non-stationary time series, then it should be possible to find a linear combination such that the residual is stationary  over time . Co-integration methods are thus similar in overall principle to regression-based approaches  to the extent that regression studies take into account the expected time series properties of the data--the example described in Box 10.1 might be characterized as looking for a linear combination of anthropogenic and natural forcings such that the observed residuals were consistent with internal climate variability as simulated by the CMIP5 models. Co-integration and error correction methods, however, generally make more explicit use of time	0
Box 10.1 | How Attribution Studies Work This box presents an idealized demonstration of the concepts underlying most current approaches to detection and attribution of climate change and how these relate to conventional linear regression. The coloured dots in Box 10.1a, Figure 1 show observed annual GMST from 1861 to 2012, with warmer years coloured red and colder years coloured blue. Observations alone indicate, unequivocally, that the Earth has warmed, but to quantify how different external factors have contributed to this warming, studies must compare such observations with the expected responses to these external factors. The orange line shows an estimate of the GMST response to anthropogenic  forcing obtained from the mean of the CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles, while the blue line shows the CMIP3/CMIP5 ensemble mean response to natural  forcing. In statistical terms, attribution involves finding the combination of these anthropogenic and natural responses that best fits these observations: this is shown by the black line in panel . To show how this fit is obtained in non-technical terms, the data are plotted against model-simulated anthropogenic warming, instead of time, in panel . There is a strong correlation between observed temperatures and model-simulated anthropogenic warming, but because of the presence of natural factors and internal climate variability, correlation alone is not enough for attribution. To quantify how much of the observed warming is attributable to human influence, panel  shows observed temperatures plotted against the model-simulated response to anthropogenic forcings in one direction and natural forcings in the other. Observed temperatures increase with both natural and anthropogenic model-simulated warming: the warmest years are in the far corner of the box. A flat surface through these points , indicated by the coloured mesh, slopes up away from the viewer.	0
The orientation of this surface indicates how model-simulated responses to natural and anthropogenic forcing need to be scaled to reproduce the observations. The best-fit gradient in the direction of anthropogenic warming  is 0.9, indicating the CMIP3/CMIP5 ensemble average overestimates the magnitude of the observed response to anthropogenic forcing by about 10%. The best-fit gradient in the direction of natural changes  is 0.7, indicating that the observed response to natural forcing is 70% of the average model-simulated response. The black line shows the points on this flat surface that are directly above or below the observations: each `pin' corresponds to a different year. When re-plotted against time, indicated by the years on the rear left face of the box, this black line gives the black line previously seen in panel . The length of the pins indicates `residual' temperature fluctuations due to internal variability. The timing of these residual temperature fluctuations is unpredictable, representing an inescapable source of uncertainty. We can quantify this uncertainty by asking how the gradients of the best-fit surface might vary if El Nino events, for example, had occurred in different years in the observed temperature record. To do this, we repeat the analysis in panel , replacing observed temperatures with samples of simulated internal climate variability from control runs of coupled climate models. Grey diamonds in panel  show the results: these gradients cluster around zero, because control runs have no anthropogenic or natural forcing, but there is still some scatter. Assuming that internal variability in global temperature simply adds to the response to external forcing, this scatter provides an estimate of uncertainty in the gradients, or scaling factors, required to reproduce the observations, shown by the red cross and ellipse. The red cross and ellipse are clearly separated from the origin, which means that the slope of the best-fit surface through the observations cannot be accounted for by internal variability: some climate change is detected in these observations. Moreover, it is also separated from both the vertical and horizontal axes, which means that the responses to both anthropogenic and natural factors are individually detectable. The magnitude of observed temperature change is consistent with the CMIP3/CMIP5 ensemble average response to anthropogenic forcing  but is significantly lower than the model-average response to natural forcing . There are, however, reasons why these models may be underestimating the response to volcanic forcing , so this discrepancy does not preclude detection and attribution of both anthropogenic and natural influence, as simulated by the CMIP3/CMIP5 ensemble average, in the observed GMST record. The top axis in panel  indicates the attributable anthropogenic warming over 1951-2010, estimated from the anthropogenic warming in the CMIP3/CMIP5 ensemble average, or the gradient of the orange line in panel  over this period. Because the model-simulated responses have been scaled to fit the observations, the attributable anthropogenic warming in this example is 0.6C to 0.9C and does not depend on the magnitude of the raw model-simulated changes. Hence an attribution statement based on such an analysis, 	0
such as `most of the warming over the past 50 years is attributable to anthropogenic drivers', depends only on the shape, or time history, not the size, of the model-simulated warming, and hence does not depend on the models' sensitivity to rising GHG levels. Formal attribution studies like this example provide objective estimates of how much recent warming is attributable to human influence. Attribution is not, however, a purely statistical exercise. It also requires an assessment that there are no confounding factors that could have caused a large part of the `attributed' change. Statistical tests can be used to check that observed residual temperature fluctuations ) are consistent with internal variability expected from coupled models, but ultimately these tests must complement physical arguments that the combination of responses to anthropogenic and natural forcing is the only available consistent explanation of recent observed temperature change. This demonstration assumes, for visualization purposes, that there are only two candidate contributors to the observed warming, anthropogenic and natural, and that only GMST is available. More complex attribution problems can be undertaken using the same principles, such as aiming to separate the response to GHGs from other anthropogenic factors by also including spatial information. These require, in effect, an extension of panel , with additional dimensions corresponding to additional causal factors, and additional points corresponding to temperatures in different regions.	0

All of these approaches are subject to the issue of confounding factors identified by Hegerl and Zwiers . For example, Beenstock et al.  fail to find a consistent co-integrating relationship between atmospheric carbon dioxide  concentrations and GMST using polynomial cointegration tests, but the fact that CO2 concentrations are derived from different sources in different periods  makes it difficult to assess the physical significance of their result, particularly in the light of evidence for co-integration between temperature and radiative forcing  reported by Kaufmann et al.  using tests of linear cointegration, and also the results of Gay-Garcia et al. , who find evidence for external forcing of climate using time series properties.	0
e xternal drivers, including spatial information, and the properties of internal climate variability. This can help to separate patterns of forced change both from each other and from internal variability. The price, however, is that results depend to some degree on the accuracy of the shape of model-simulated responses to external factors , which is assessed by comparing results obtained with expected responses estimated from different climate models. When the signal-to-noise  ratio is low, as can be the case for some regional indicators and some variables other than temperature, the accuracy of the specification of variability becomes a central factor in the reliability of any detection and attribution study. Many studies of such variables inflate the variability estimate from models to determine if results are sensitive to, for example, doubling of variance in the control , although Imbers et al.  note that errors in the spectral properties of simulated variability may also be important.	0
The assumptions of the statistical model employed can also influence results. For example, Schlesinger and Ramankutty  and Zhou and Tung  show that GMST are consistent with a linear anthropogenic trend, enhanced variability due to an approximately 70-year Atlantic Meridional Oscillation  and shorter-term variability. If, however, there are physical grounds to expect a nonlinear anthropogenic trend , the assumption of a linear trend can itself enhance the variance assigned to a low-frequency oscillation. The fact that the AMO index is estimated from detrended historical temperature observations further increases the risk that its variance may be overestimated, because regressors and regressands are not independent. Folland et al. , using a physically based estimate of the anthropogenic trend, find a smaller role for the AMO in recent warming.	0
A full description of optimal fingerprinting is provided in Appendix 9.A of Hegerl et al.  and further discussion is to be found in Hasselmann , Allen and Tett , Allen et al. , and Hegerl and Zwiers . Box 10.1 provides a simple example of `fingerprinting' based on GMST alone. In a typical fingerprint analysis, model-simulated spatio-temporal patterns of response to different combinations of external forcings, including segments of control integrations with no forcing, are `observed' in a similar manner to the historical record . The magnitudes of the model-simulated responses are then estimated in the observations using a variant of linear regression, possibly allowing for signals being contaminated by internal variability  and structural model uncertainty .	0
Time series methods ultimately depend on the structural adequacy of the statistical model employed. Many such studies, for example, use models that assume a single exponential decay time for the response to both external forcing and stochastic fluctuations. This can lead to an overemphasis on short-term fluctuations, and is not consistent with the response of more complex models . Smirnov and Mokhov  propose an alternative characterization that allows them to distinguish a `long-term causality' that focuses on low-frequency changes. Trends that appear significant when tested against an AR model may not be significant when tested against a process that supports this `long-range dependence' . Although the evidence for long-range dependence in global temperature data remains a topic of debate  , it is generally desirable to explore sensitivity of results to the specification of the statistical model, and also to other methods of estimating the properties of internal variability, such as more complex climate models, discussed next. For example, Imbers et al.  demonstrate that the detection of the influence of increasing GHGs in the global temperature record is robust to the assumption of a Fractional Differencing  model of internal variability, which supports long-range dependence.	0
In `optimal' fingerprinting, model-simulated responses and observations are normalized by internal variability to improve the S/N ratio. This requires an estimate of the inverse noise covariance estimated from the sample covariance matrix of a set of unforced  simulations , or from variations within an initial-condition ensemble. Because these control runs are generally too short to estimate the full covariance matrix, a truncated version is used, retaining only a small number, typically of order 10 to 20, of high-variance principal components. Sensitivity analyses are essential to ensure results are robust to this, relatively arbitrary, choice of truncation . Ribes et al.  use a regularized estimate of the covariance matrix, meaning a linear combination of the sample covariance matrix and a unit matrix that has been shown  to provide a more accurate estimate of the true covariance, thereby avoiding dependence on truncation. Optimization of S/N ratio is not, however, essential for many attribution results  and uncertainty analysis in conventional optimal fingerprinting does not require the covariance matrix to be inverted, so although regularization may help in some cases, it is not essential. Ribes et al.  also propose a hybrid of the model-based optimal fingerprinting and time series approaches, referred to as `temporal optimal detection', under which each signal is assumed to consist of a single spatial pattern modulated by a smoothly varying time series estimated from a climate model .	0
The final statistical step in an attribution study is to check that the residual variability, after the responses to external drivers have been estimated and removed, is consistent with the expected properties of internal climate variability, to ensure that the variability used for uncertainty analysis is realistic, and that there is no evidence that a potentially confounding factor has been omitted. Many studies use a standard F-test of residual consistency for this purpose . Ribes et al.  raise some issues with this test, but key results are not found to be sensitive to different formulations. A more important issue is that the F-test is relatively weak , so `passing' this test is not a safeguard against unrealistic variability, which is why estimates of internal variability are discussed in detail in this chapter and in Chapter 9.	0
reported that the response to anthropogenic GHG increase is very likely greater than half the total observed warming, it means that the null hypothesis that the GHG-induced warming is less than half the total can be rejected with the data available at the 10% significance level. Expert judgment is required in frequentist attribution assessments, but its role is limited to the assessment of whether internal variability and potential confounding factors have been adequately accounted for, and to downgrade nominal significance levels to account for remaining uncertainties. Uncertainties may, in some cases, be further reduced if prior expectations regarding attribution results themselves are incorporated, using a Bayesian approach, but this not currently the usual practice.	0
A further consistency check often used in optimal fingerprinting is whether the estimated magnitude of the externally driven responses are consistent between model and observations : if they are not, attribution is still possible provided the discrepancy is explicable in terms of known uncertainties in the magnitude of either forcing or response. As is emphasized in Section 10.2.1 and Box 10.1, attribution is not a purely statistical assessment: physical judgment is required to assess whether the combination of responses considered allows for all major potential confounding factors and whether any remaining discrepancies are consistent with a physically based understanding of the responses to external forcing and internal climate variability.	0
This traditional emphasis on single-step studies and placing lower bounds on the magnitude of signals under investigation means that, very often, the communication of attribution results tends to be conservative, with attention focussing on whether or not human influence in a particular variable might be zero, rather than the upper end of the confidence interval, which might suggest a possible response much bigger than current model-simulated changes. Consistent with previous Assessments and the majority of the literature, this chapter adopts this conservative emphasis. It should, however, be borne in mind that this means that positive attribution results will tend to be biased towards well-observed, well-modelled variables and regions, which should be taken into account in the compilation of global impact assessments .	0
10.3.1.1 Surface  To address attribution questions for variables for which these conditions are not satisfied, Hegerl et al.  introduced the notation of `multi-step attribution', formalizing existing practice . In a multi-step attribution study, the attributable change in a variable such as large-scale surface temperature is estimated with a single-step procedure, along with its associated uncertainty, and the implications of this change are then explored in a further  modelling step. Overall conclusions can only be as robust as the least certain link in the multi-step procedure. As the focus shifts towards more noisy regional changes, it can be difficult to separate the effect of different external forcings. In such cases, it can be useful to detect the response to all external forcings, and then determine the most important factors underlying the attribution results by reference to a closely related variable for which a full attribution analysis is available . Attribution results are typically expressed in terms of conventional `frequentist' confidence intervals or results of hypothesis tests: when it is 878	0
10.3.1.1.1 Observations of surface temperature change GMST warmed strongly over the period 1900-1940, followed by a period with little trend, and strong warming since the mid-1970s . Almost all observed locations have warmed since 1901 whereas over the satellite period since 1979 most regions have warmed while a few regions have cooled . Although this picture is supported by all available global near-surface temperature data sets, there are some differences in detail between them, but these are much smaller than both interannual variability and the long-term trend . Since 1998 the trend in GMST has been small . Urbanization is unlikely to have caused more than 10% of the measured centennial trend in land mean surface temperature, though it may have contributed substantially more to regional mean surface temperature trends in rapidly developing regions .	0

because climate sensitivity is not a strong function of the bias in GMST in the CMIP5 models . Simulations with GHG changes only, and no changes in aerosols or other forcings, tend to simulate more warming than observed , as expected. Better agreement between models and observations when the models include anthropogenic forcings is also seen in the CMIP3 simulations . RF in the simulations including anthropogenic and natural forcings differs considerably among models , and forcing differences explain much of the differences in temperature response between models over the historical period . Differences between observed GMST based on three observational data sets are small compared to forced changes .	0
As discussed in Section 10.2, detection and attribution assessments are more robust if they consider more than simple consistency arguments. Analyses that allow for the possibility that models might be consistently over- or underestimating the magnitude of the response to climate forcings are assessed in Section 10.3.1.1.3, the conclusions from which are not affected by evidence that model spread in GMST in CMIP3, is smaller than implied by the uncertainty in RF . Although there is evidence that CMIP3 models with a higher climate sensitivity tend to have a smaller increase in RF over the historical period , no such relationship was found in CMIP5  which	0
may explain the wider spread of the CMIP5 ensemble compared to the CMIP3 ensemble . Climate model parameters are typically chosen primarily to reproduce features of the mean climate and variability , and CMIP5 aerosol emissions are standardized across models and based on historical emissions , rather than being chosen by each modelling group independently . Figure 10.2a shows the pattern of annual mean surface temperature trends observed over the period 1901-2010, based on Hadley Centre/ Climatic Research Unit gridded surface temperature data set 4 . Warming has been observed at almost all locations with sufficient observations available since 1901. Rates of warming are generally higher over land areas compared to oceans, as is also apparent over the 1951-2010 period , which simulations indicate is due mainly to differences in local feedbacks and a net anomalous heat transport from oceans to land under GHG forcing, rather than differences in thermal inertia . Figure 10.2e demonstrates that a similar pattern of warming is simulated in the CMIP5 simulations with natural and anthropogenic forcing over the 1901-2010 period. Over most regions, observed trends fall between the 5th and 95th percentiles of simulated trends, and van Oldenborgh et al.  find that over the 1950-2011 period the pattern of observed grid cell trends agrees with CMIP5 simulated trends to within a combination of	0

Over the period 1979-2010 most observed regions exhibited warming , but much of the eastern Pacific and Southern Oceans cooled. These regions of cooling are not seen in the simulated trends over this period in response to anthropogenic and natural forcing , which show significantly more warming in much of these regions . This cooling and reduced warming in observations over the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes over the 1979-2010 period can also be seen in the zonal mean trends , which also shows that the models tend to warm too much in this region over this period. However, there is no discrepancy in zonal mean temperature trends over the longer 1901-2010 period in this region , suggesting that the discrepancy over the 1979-2010 period either may be an unusually strong manifestation of internal variability in the observations or relate to regionally important forcings over the past three decades which are not included in most CMIP5 simulations, such as sea salt aerosol increases due to strengthened high latitude winds , or sea ice extent increases driven by freshwater input from ice shelf melting . Except at high latitudes, zonal mean trends over the 1901-2010 period in all three data sets are inconsistent with naturally forced trends, indicating a detectable anthropogenic signal in most zonal means over this period . McKitrick and Tole  find that few CMIP3 models have significant explanatory power when fitting the spatial pattern of 1979-2002 trends in surface temperature over land, by which they mean that these models add little or no skill to a fit including the spatial pattern of tropospheric temperature trends as well as the major atmospheric oscillations. This is to be expected, as temperatures in the troposphere are well correlated in the vertical, and local temperature trends over so short a period are dominated by internal variability.	0
model spread and internal variability. Areas of disagreement over the 1901-2010 period include parts of Asia and the Southern Hemisphere  mid-latitudes, where the simulations warm less than the observations, and parts of the tropical Pacific, where the simulations warm more than the observations . Stronger warming in observations than models over parts of East Asia could in part be explained by uncorrected urbanization influence in the observations , or by an overestimate of the response to aerosol increases. Trends simulated in response to natural forcings only are generally close to zero, and inconsistent with observed trends in most locations  . Trends simulated in response to GHG changes only over the 1901-2010 period are larger than those observed at most locations, and in many cases significantly so . This is expected because these simulations do not include the cooling effects of aerosols. Differences in patterns of simulated and observed seasonal mean temperature trends and possible causes are considered in more detail in Box 11.2.	0

all these results support the AR4 assessment that GHG increases very likely caused most  of the observed GMST increase since the mid-20th century . The results of multiple regression analyses of observed temperature changes onto the simulated responses to GHG, other anthropogenic and natural forcings are shown in Figure 10.4 . The results, based on HadCRUT4 and a multi-model average, show robustly detected responses to GHG in the observational record whether data from 1861-2010 or only from 1951-2010 are analysed . The advantage of analysing the longer period is that more information on observed and modelled changes is included, while a disadvantage is that it is difficult to validate climate models' estimates of internal variability over such a long period. Individual model results exhibit considerable spread among scaling factors, with estimates of warming attributable to each forcing sensitive to the model used for the analsys (Figure 10.4; Gillett	0
et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013; Ribes and Terray, 2013), the period over which the analysis is applied , and the Empirical Orthogonal Function  truncation or degree of spatial filtering . In some cases the GHG response is not detectable in regressions using individual models , or a residual test is failed , indicating a poor fit between the simulated response and observed changes. Such cases are probably due largely to errors in the spatio-temporal pattern of responses to forcings simulated in individual models , although observational error and internal variability errors could also play a role. Nonetheless, analyses in which responses are averaged across multiple models generally show much less sensitivity to period and EOF trucation , and more consistent residuals , which may be because model response errors are smaller in a multi-model mean.	0

We derive assessed ranges for the attributable contributions of GHGs, other anthropogenic forcings and natural forcings by taking the smallest ranges with a precision of one decimal place that span the 5 to 95% ranges of attributable trends over the 1951-2010 period from the Jones et al.  weighted multi-model analysis and the Gillett et al.  multi-model analysis considering observational uncertainty . The assessed range for the attributable contribution of combined anthropogenic forcings was derived in the same way from the Gillett et al.  multi-model attributable trend and shown in Figure 10.4c. We moderate our likelihood assessment and report likely ranges rather than the very likely ranges directly implied by these studies in order to account for residual sources of uncertainty including sensitivity to EOF truncation and analysis period . In this context, GHGs means well-mixed greenhouse gases , other anthropogenic forcings means aerosol changes, and in most models ozone changes and land use changes, and natural forcings means solar irradiance changes and volcanic aerosols. Over the 1951-2010 period, the observed GMST increased by approximately 0.6C. GHG increases likely contributed 0.5C to 1.3C, other anthropogenic forcings likely contributed -0.6C to 0.1C and natural forcings likely contributed -0.1C to 0.1C to observed GMST trends over this period. Internal variability likely contributed -0.1C to 0.1C to observed trends over this period . This assessment is shown schematically in Figure 10.5. The assessment is supported additionally by a complementary analysis in which the parameters of an Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity  were constrained using observations of near-surface temperature and ocean heat content, as well as prior information on the magnitudes of forcings, and which concluded that GHGs have caused 0.6C to 1.1C  warming since the mid-20th century ; an analysis by Wigley and Santer , who used an energy balance model and RF and climate sensitivity estimates from AR4, and they concluded that there was about a 93% chance that GHGs caused a warming greater than observed over the 1950-2005 period; and earlier detection and attribution studies assessed in the AR4 . The inclusion of additional data to 2010 ) helps to better constrain the magnitude of the GHG-attributable warming , as does the inclusion of spatial information , though Ribes and Terray  caution that in some cases there are inconsistencies between observed spatial patterns of response and those simulated in indvidual models. While Hegerl et al.  assessed that a significant cooling of about 0.2 C was attributable to natural forcings over the 1950-1999 period, the temperature trend attributable to natural forcings over the 1951-2010 period is very small . This is because, while Mt Pinatubo cooled global temperatures in the early 1990s, there have been no large volcanic eruptions since, resulting in small simulated trends in response to natural forcings over the 1951-2010 period . Regression coefficients for natural forcings tend to be smaller than one, suggesting that the response to natural forcings may be overestimated by the CMIP5 models on average . Attribution of observed changes is robust to observational uncertainty which is comparably important to internal climate variability as a source of uncertainty in	0
GHG-attributable warming and aerosol-attributable cooling . The response to GHGs was detected using Hadley Centre new Global Environmental Model 2-Earth System , Canadian Earth System Model 2  and other CMIP5 models except for Goddard Institute for Space Studies-E2-H  . However, the influence of other anthropogenic forcings was detected only in some CMIP5 models . This lack of detection of other anthropogenic forcings compared to detection of an aerosol response using four CMIP3 models over the period 1900-1999  does not only relate to the use of data to 2010 rather than 2000 , although this could play a role . Whether it is associated with a cancellation of aerosol cooling by ozone and black carbon  warming in the CMIP5 simulations, making the signal harder to detect, or by some aspect of the response to other anthropogenic forcings that is less realistic in these models is not clear. Although closely constraining the GHG and other anthropogenic contributions to observed warming remains challenging owing to their degeneracy and sensitivity to methodological choices , a total anthropogenic contribution to warming can be much more robustly constrained by a regression of observed temperature changes onto the simulated responses to all anthropogenic forcings and natural forcings . Robust detection of anthropogenic influence is also found if a new optimal detection methodology, the Regularised Optimal Fingerprint approach , is applied . A better constrained estimate of the total anthropogenic contribution to warming since the mid-20th century than the GHG contribution is also found by Wigley and Santer . Knutson et al.  demonstrate that observed trends in GMST are inconsistent with the simulated response to natural forcings alone, but consistent with the simulated response to natural and anthropogenic forcings for all periods beginning between 1880 and 1990 and ending in 2010, which they interpret as evidence that warming is in part attributable to anthropogenic influence over these periods. Based on the well-constrained attributable anthropogenic trends shown in Figure 10.4 we assess that anthropogenic forcings likely contributed 0.6C to 0.8C to the observed warming over the 1951-2010 period . There are some inconsistencies in the simulated and observed magnitudes of responses to forcing for some CMIP5 models ; for example, CanESM2 has a GHG regression coefficient significantly less than 1 and a regression coefficient for other anthropogenic forcings also significantly less than 1 , indicating that this model overestimates the magnitude of the response to GHGs and to other anthropogenic forcings. Averaged over the ensembles of models considered by Gillett et al.  and Jones et al. , the best-estimate GHG and OA scaling factors are less than 1 , indicating that the model mean GHG and OA responses should be scaled down to best match observations. The best-estimate GHG scaling factors are larger than the best-estimate OA scaling factors, although the discrepancy from 1 is not significant in either case and the ranges of the GHG 883	0
10 and OA scaling factors are overlapping. Overall there is some evidence that some CMIP5 models have a higher transient response to GHGs and a larger response to other anthropogenic forcings  than the real world . Inconsistencies between simulated and observed trends in GMST were also identified in several CMIP3 models by Fyfe et al.  after removing volcanic, El Nino-Southern Oscillation , and Cold Ocean/ Warm Land pattern  signals from GMST, although uncertainties may have been underestimated because residuals were modelled by a first-order autoregressive processes. A longer observational record and a better understanding of the temporal changes in forcing should make it easier to identify discrepancies between the magnitude of the observed response to a forcing, and the magnitude of the response simulated in individual models. To the extent that inconsistencies between simulated and observed changes are independent between models, this issue may be addressed by basing our assessment on attribution analyses using the mean response from multiple models, and by accounting for model uncertainty when making such assessments. In conclusion, although some inconsistencies in the forced responses of individual models and observations have been identified, the detection of the global temperature response to GHG increases using average responses from multiple models is robust to observational uncertainty and methodological choices. It is supported by basic physical arguments. We conclude, consistent with Hegerl et al. , that more than half of the observed increase in GMST from 1951 to 2010 is very likely due to the observed anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations. The influence of BC aerosols  has been detected in the recent global temperature record in one analysis, although the warming attributable to BC by Jones et al.  is small compared to that attributable to GHG increases. This warming is 884	0
s imulated mainly over the Northern Hemisphere  with a sufficiently distinct spatio-temporal pattern that it could be separated from the response to other forcings in this study. Several recent studies have used techniques other than regression-based detection and attribution analyses to address the causes of recent global temperature changes. Drost and Karoly  demonstrated that observed GMST, land-ocean temperature contrast, meridional temperature gradient and annual cycle amplitude exhibited trends over the period 1956-2005 that were outside the 5 to 95% range of simulated internal variability in eight CMIP5 models, based on three different observational data sets. They also found that observed trends in GMST and land-ocean temperature contrast were larger than those simulated in any of 36 CMIP5 simulations with natural forcing only. Drost et al.  found that 1961-2010 trends in GMST and land-ocean temperature contrast were significantly larger than simulated internal variability in eight CMIP3 models. By comparing observed GMST with simple statistical models, Zorita et al.  concluded that there is a very low probability that observed clustering of very warm years in the last decade occurred by chance. Smirnov and Mokhov , adopting an approach that allowed them to distinguish between conventional Granger causality and a `long-term causality' that focuses on low-frequency changes , found that increasing CO2 concentrations are the principal determining factor in the rise of GMST over recent decades. Sedlacek and Knutti  found that the spatial patterns of sea surface temperature  trends from simulations forced with increases in GHGs and other anthropogenic forcings agree well with observations but differ from warming patterns associated with internal variability. Several studies that have aimed to separate forced surface temperature variations from those associated with internal variability have identified the North Atlantic as a dominant centre of multi-decadal	0
internal variability, and in particular modes of variability related to the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation . The AMO index is defined as an area average of North Atlantic SSTs, and it has an apparent period of around 70 years, which is long compared to the length of observational record making it difficult to deduce robust conclusions about the role of the AMO from only two cycles. Nevertheless, several studies claim a role for internal variability associated with the AMO in driving enhanced warming in the 1980s and 1990s as well as the recent slow down in warming , while attributing long-term warming to anthropogenically forced variations either by analysing time series of GMST, forcings and indices of the AMO  or by analysing both spatial and temporal patterns of temperature . Studies based on global mean time series could risk falsely attributing variability to the AMO when variations in external forcings, for example, associated with aerosols, could also cause similar variability. In contrast, studies using space-time patterns seek to distinguish the spatial structure of temperature anomalies associated with the AMO from those associated with forced variability. Unforced climate simulations indicate that internal multi-decadal variability in the Atlantic is characterized by surface anomalies of the same sign from the equator to the high latitudes, with maximum amplitudes in subpolar regions  while the net response to anthropogenic and natural forcing over the 20th century, such as observed temperature change, is characterized by warming nearly everywhere on the globe, but with minimum warming or even cooling in the subpolar regions of the North Atlantic .	0
Some studies implicate tropospheric aerosols in driving decadal variations in Atlantic SST , and temperature variations in eastern North America . Booth et al.  find that most multi-decadal variability in North Atlantic SSTs is simulated in one model mainly in response to aerosol variations, although its simulated changes in North Atlantic ocean heat content and salinity have been shown to be inconsistent with observations . To the extent that climate models simulate realistic internal variability in the AMO , AMO variability is accounted for in uncertainty estimates from regression-based detection and attribution studies . To summarize, recent studies using spatial features of observed temperature variations to separate AMO variability from externally forced changes find that detection of external influence on global temperatures is not compromised by accounting for AMO-congruent variability . There remains some uncertainty about how much decadal variability of GMST that is attributed to AMO in some studies is actually related to forcing, notably from aerosols. There is agreement among studies that the contribution of the AMO to global warming since 1951 is very small  and given that observed warming since 1951 is very large compared to climate model estimates of internal variability , which are assessed to be adequate at global scale , we conclude that it is virtually certain that internal variability alone cannot account for the observed global warming since 1951.	0
Box 10.2 | The Sun's Influence on the Earth's Climate A number of studies since AR4 have addressed the possible influences of long-term fluctuations of solar irradiance on past climates, particularly related to the relative warmth of the Medieval Climate Anomaly  and the relative coolness in the Little Ice Age . There is medium confidence that both external solar and volcanic forcing, and internal variability, contributed substantially to the spatial patterns of surface temperature changes between the MCA and the LIA, but very low confidence in quantitative estimates of their relative contributions . The combined influence of volcanism, solar forcing and a small drop in greenhouse gases  likely contributed to Northern Hemisphere cooling during the LIA . Solar radiative forcing  from the Maunder Minimum  to the satellite era  has been estimated to be +0.08 to +0.18 W m-2 . This may have contributed to early 20th century warming . More recently, it is extremely unlikely that the contribution from solar forcing to the observed global warming since 1950 was larger than that from GHGs . It is very likely that there has been a small decrease in solar forcing of -0.04  W m-2 over a period with direct satellite measurements of solar output from 1986 to 2008 . There is high confidence that changes in total solar irradiance have not contributed to global warming during that period. Since AR4, there has been considerable new research that has connected solar forcing to climate. The effect of solar forcing on GMST trends has been found to be small, with less than 0.1C warming attributable to combined solar and volcanic forcing over the 1951- 2010 period , although the 11-year cycle of solar variability has been found to have some influence on GMST variability over the 20th century. GMST changes between solar maxima and minima are estimated to be of order 0.1C from some regression studies of GMST and forcing estimates , although several studies have suggested these results may be too large owing to issues including degeneracy between forcing and with internal variability, overfitting of forcing indices and underestimated uncertainties in responses . Climate models generally show less than half this variability . 	0
Variability associated with the 11-year solar cycle has also been shown to produce measurable short-term regional and seasonal climate anomalies  particularly in the Indo-Pacific, Northern Asia and North Atlantic regions . For example, studies have suggested an 11-year solar response in the Indo-Pacific region in which the equatorial eastern Pacific sea surface temperatures  tend to be below normal, the sea level pressure  in the Gulf of Alaska and the South Pacific above normal, and the tropical convergence zones on both hemispheres strengthened and displaced polewards under solar maximum conditions, although it can be difficult to discriminate the solar-forced signal from the El Nino-Southern Oscillation  signal . For northern summer, there is evidence that for peaks in the 11-year solar cycle, the Indian monsoon is intensified , with solar variability affecting interannual connections between the Indian and Pacific sectors due to a shift in the location of the descending branch of the Walker Circulation . In addition, model sensitivity experiments  suggest that the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation  is more prevalent during solar minima and there is some evidence of this in observations, including an indication of increased frequency of high-pressure `blocking' events over Europe in winter . Two mechanisms have been identified in observations and simulated with climate models that could explain these low amplitude regional responses . These mechanisms are additive and may reinforce one another so that the response to an initial small change in solar irradiance is amplified regionally . The first mechanism is a top-down mechanism first noted by Haigh  where greater solar ultraviolet radiation  in peak solar years warms the stratosphere directly via increased radiation and indirectly via increased ozone production. This can result in a chain of processes that influences deep tropical convection . In addition, there is less heating than average in the tropical upper stratosphere under solar minimum conditions which weakens the equator-to-pole temperature gradient. This signal can propagate downward to weaken the tropospheric mid-latitude westerlies, thus favoring a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation  or NAO. This response has been shown in several models  though there is no significant AO or NAO response to solar irradiance variations on average in the CMIP5 models .	0
The second mechanism is a bottom-up mechanism that involves coupled air-sea radiative processes in the tropical and subtropical Pacific that also influence convection in the deep tropics . Such mechanisms have also been shown to influence regional temperatures over longer time scales , and can help explain patterns of regional temperature changes seen in paleoclimate data  although they have little effect on global or hemispheric mean temperatures at either short or long time scales. A possible amplifying mechanism linking solar variability and the Earth's climate system via cosmic rays has been postulated. It is proposed that variations in the cosmic ray flux associated with changes in solar magnetic activity affect ion-induced aerosol nucleation and cloud condensation nuclei  production in the troposphere . A strong solar magnetic field would deflect cosmic rays and lead to fewer CCN and less cloudiness, thereby allowing for more solar energy into the system. Since AR4, there has been further evidence to disprove the importance of this amplifying mechanism. Correlations between cosmic ray flux and observed aerosol or cloud properties are weak and local at best, and do not prove to be robust on the regional or global scale . Although there is some evidence that ionization from cosmic rays may enhance aerosol nucleation in the free troposphere, there is medium evidence and high agreement that the cosmic ray-ionization mechanism is too weak to influence global concentrations of CCN or their change over the last century or during a solar cycle in any climatically significant way . The lack of trend in cosmic ray intensity over the 1960-2005 period  provides another argument against the hypothesis of a major contribution of cosmic ray variations to the observed warming over that period given the existence of short time scales in the climate system response. Thus, although there is medium confidence that solar variability has made contributions to past climate fluctuations, since the mid20th century there has been little trend in solar forcing. There are at least two amplifying mechanisms that have been proposed and simulated in some models that could explain small observed regional and seasonal climate anomalies associated with the 11-year solar cycle, mostly in the Indo-Pacific region and northern mid to high latitudes. Regarding possible future influences of the sun on the Earth's climate, there is very low confidence in our ability to predict future solar output, but there is high confidence that the effects from solar irradiance variations will be much smaller than the projected climate changes from increased RF due to GHGs . 886	0
Based on a range of detection and attribution analyses using multiple solar irradiance reconstructions and models, Hegerl et al.  concluded that it is very likely that GHGs caused more global warming than solar irradiance variations over the 1950-1999 period. Detection and attribution analyses applied to the CMIP5 simulations  indicate less than 0.1C temperature change attributable to combined solar and volcanic forcing over the 1951-2010 period. Based on a regression of paleo temperatures onto the response to solar forcing simulated by an energy balance model, Scafetta and West  find that up to 50% of the warming since 1900 may be solar-induced, but Benestad and Schmidt  show this conclusion is not robust, being based on disregarding forcings other than solar in the preindustrial period, and assuming a high and precisely known value for climate sensitivity. Despite claims that more than half the warming since 1970 can be ascribed to solar variability  , a conclusion based on an incorrect assumption of no anthropogenic influence before 1950 and a 60-year solar cycle influence on global temperature , several studies show that solar variations cannot explain global mean surface warming over the past 25 years, because solar irradiance has declined over this period . Lean and Rind  conclude that solar forcing explains only 10% of the warming over the past 100 years, while contributing a small cooling over the past 25 years. Thus while there is some evidence for solar influences on regional climate variability  solar forcing has only had a small effect on GMST. Overall, we conclude that it is extremely unlikely that the contribution from solar forcing to the warming since 1950 was larger than that from GHGs. A range of studies have used statistical methods to separate out the influence of known sources of internal variability, including ENSO and, in some cases, the AMO, from the response to external drivers, including volcanoes, solar variability and anthropogenic influence, in the recent GMST record: see, for example, Lockwood , Lean and Rind , Folland et al. , Foster and Rahmstorf  and Kaufmann et al. . Representative results, as summarized in Imbers et al. , are shown in Figure 10.6. These consistently attribute most of the warming over the past 50 years to anthropogenic influence, even allowing for potential confounding factors like the AMO. While results of such statistical approaches are sensitive to assumptions regarding the properties of both responses to external drivers and internal variability , they provide a complementary approach to attribution studies based on global climate models. Overall, given that the anthropogenic increase in GHGs likely caused 0.5C to 1.3C warming over 1951-2010, with other anthropogenic forcings probably contributing counteracting cooling, that the effects of natural forcings and natural internal variability are estimated to be small, and that well-constrained and robust estimates of net anthropogenic warming are substantially more than half the observed warming  we conclude that it is extremely likely that human activities caused more than half of the observed increase in GMST from 1951 to 2010. The early 20th century warming The instrumental GMST record shows a pronounced warming during the first half of the 20th century . Correction of residual	0
biases in SST observations leads to a higher estimate of 1950s temperatures, but does not substantially change the warming between 1900 and 1940 . The AR4 concluded that `the early 20th century warming is very likely in part due to external forcing' , and that it is likely that anthropogenic forcing contributed to this warming. This assessment was based on studies including Shiogama et al.  who find a contribution from solar and volcanic forcing to observed warming to 1949, and Min and Hense , who find strong evidence for a forced  contribution to global warming from 1900 to 1949. Ring et al.  estimate, based on time series analysis, that part of the early 20th century warming was due to GHG increases , but find a dominant contribution by internal variability. CMIP5 model simulations of the historical period show forced warming over the early 20th century , consistent with earlier detection and attribution analyses highlighted in the AR4 and TAR. The early 20th century contributes to the detection of external forcings over the 20th century estimated by detection and attribution results  and to the detected change over the last millennium to 1950 . The pattern of warming and residual differences between models and observations indicate a role for circulation changes as a contributor to early 20th cenury warming , and the contribution of internal variability to the early 20th century warming has been analysed in several publications since the AR4. Crook and Forster  find that the observed 1918-1940 warming was significantly greater than that simulated by most of the CMIP3 models. A distinguishing feature of the early 20th century warming is its pattern  which shows the most pronounced warming in the Arctic during the cold season, followed by North America during the warm season, the North Atlantic Ocean and the tropics. In contrast, there was no unusual warming in Australia among other regions . Such a pronounced pattern points to a role for circulation change as a contributing factor to the regional anomalies contributing to this warming. Some studies have suggested that the warming is a response to the AMO , or a large but random expression of internal variability . Knight et al.  diagnose a shift from the negative to the positive phase of the AMO from 1910 to 1940, a mode of circulation that is estimated to contribute approximately 0.1C, trough to peak, to GMST . Nonetheless, these studies do not challenge the AR4 assessment that external forcing very likely made a contribution to the warming over this period. In conclusion, the early 20th century warming is very unlikely to be due to internal variability alone. It remains difficult to quantify the contribution to this warming from internal variability, natural forcing and anthropogenic forcing, due to forcing and response uncertainties and incomplete observational coverage. Year-to-year and decade-to-decade variability of global mean surface temperature Time series analyses, such as those shown in Figure 10.6, seek to partition the variability of GMST into components attributable to anthropogenic and natural forcings and modes of internal variability such as ENSO and the AMO.

First, the relative contribution of internal variability compared to the forced response to observed changes tends to be larger on smaller scales, as spatial differences in internal variations are averaged out in large-scale means. Second, because the patterns of response to climate forcings tend to be large scale, there is less spatial information to help distinguish between the responses to different forcings when attention is restricted to a sub-global area. Third, forcings omitted in some global climate model simulations may be important on regional scales, such as land use change or BC aerosol. Lastly, simulated internal variability and responses to forcings may be less reliable on smaller scales than on the global scale. Knutson et al.  find a tendency for CMIP5 models to overestimate decadal variability in the NH extratropics in individual grid cells and underestimate it elsewhere, although Karoly and Wu  and Wu and Karoly  find that variability is not generally underestimated in earlier generation models. Based on several studies, Hegerl et al.  concluded that `it is likely that there has been a substantial anthropogenic contribution	0
to surface temperature increases in every continent except Antarctica since the middle of the 20th century'. Figure 10.7 shows comparisons of observed continental scale temperatures  with CMIP5 simulations including both anthropogenic and natural forcings  and including just natural forcings . Observed temperatures are largely within the range of simulations with anthropogenic forcings for all regions and outside the range of simulations with only natural forcings for all regions except Antarctica . Averaging over all observed locations, Antarctica has warmed over the 1950-2008 period , even though some individual locations have cooled, particularly in summer and autumn, and over the shorter 1960-1999 period . When temperature changes associated with changes in the Southern Annular Mode are removed by regression, both observations and model simulations indicate warming at all observed locations except the South Pole over the 1950-1999 period . An analysis of Antarctic land temperatures over the period 1950-1999 889	0
detected separate natural and anthropogenic responses of consistent magnitude in simulations and observations . Thus anthropogenic influence on climate has now been detected on all seven continents. However the evidence for human influence on Antarctic temperature is much weaker than for the other six continental regions. There is only one attribution study for this region, and there is greater observational uncertainty than the other regions, with very few data before 1950, and sparse coverage that is mainly limited to the coast and the Antarctic Peninsula. As a result of the observational uncertainties, there is low confidence in Antarctic region land surface air temperatures changes  and we conclude for Antarctica there is low confidence that anthropogenic influence has contributed to the observed warming averaged over available stations.	0
Since the publication of the AR4 several other studies have applied attribution analyses to continental and sub-continental scale regions. Min and Hense  applied a Bayesian decision analysis technique to continental-scale temperatures using the CMIP3 multi-model ensemble and concluded that forcing combinations including GHG increases provide the best explanation of 20th century observed changes in temperature on every inhabited continent except Europe, where the observational evidence is not decisive in their analysis. Jones et al.  detected anthropogenic influence on summer temperatures over all NH continents and in many subcontinental NH land regions in an optimal detection analysis that considered the temperature responses to anthropogenic and natural forcings. Christidis et al.  used a multi-model ensemble constrained by global-scale observed temperature changes to estimate the changes in probability of occurrence of warming or cooling trends over the 1950-1997 period over various sub-continental scale regions. They concluded that the probability of occurrence of warming trends had been at least doubled by anthropogenic forcing over all such regions except Central North America. The estimated distribution of warming trends over the Central North America region was approximately centred on the observed trend, so no inconsistency between simulated and observed trends was identified there. Knutson et al.  demonstrated that observed temperature trends from the beginning of the observational record to 2010 averaged over Europe, Africa, Northern Asia, Southern Asia, Australia and South America are all inconsistent with the simulated response to natural forcings alone, and consistent with the simulated response to combined natural and anthropogenic forcings in the CMIP5 models. They reached a similar conclusion for the major ocean basins with the exception of the North Atlantic, where variability is high. Several recent studies have applied attribution analyses to specific sub-continental regions. Anthropogenic influence has been found in winter minimum temperature over the western USA , a conclusion that is found to be robust to weighting models according to various aspects of their climatology ; anthropogenic influence has been found in temperature trends over New Zealand  after circulation-related variability is removed as in Gillett et al. ; and anthropogenic influence has been found in temperature trends over France, using a first-order autoregressive model of internal variability . Increases in anthropogenic GHGs were found to be the main driver of the 20th-century SST increases in both Atlantic and Pacific tropical cyclogenesis regions . Over both 890	0
regions, the response to anthropogenic forcings is detected when the response to natural forcings is also included in the analysis . Knutson et al.  detect an anthropogenic influence over Canada, but not over the continental USA, Alaska or Mexico. Gillett et al.  detect anthropogenic influence on near-surface Arctic temperatures over land, with a consistent magnitude in simulations and observations. Wang et al.  also find that observed Arctic warming is inconsistent with simulated internal variability. Both studies ascribe Arctic warmth in the 1930s and 1940s largely to internal variability. Shindell and Faluvegi  infer a large contribution to both mid-century Arctic cooling and late century warming from aerosol forcing changes, with GHGs the dominant driver of long-term warming, though they infer aerosol forcing changes from temperature changes using an inverse approach which may lead to some changes associated with internal variability being attributed to aerosol forcing. We therefore conclude that despite the uncertainties introduced by limited observational coverage, high internal variability, modelling uncertainties  and poorly understood local forcings, such as the effect of BC on snow, there is sufficiently strong evidence to conclude that it is likely that there has been an anthropogenic contribution to the very substantial warming in Arctic land surface temperatures over the past 50 years. Some attribution analyses have considered temperature trends at the climate model grid box scale. At these spatial scales robust attribution is difficult to obtain, since climate models often lack the processes needed to simulate regional details realistically, regionally important forcings may be missing in some models and observational uncertainties are very large for some regions of the world at grid box scale . Nevertheless an attribution analysis has been carried out on Central England temperature, a record that extends back to 1659 and is sufficiently long to demonstrate that the representation of multi-decadal variability in the single grid box in the model used, Hadley Centre climate prediction model 3  is adequate for detection . The observed trend in Central England Temperature is inconsistent with either internal variability or the simulated response to natural forcings, but is consistent with the simulated response when anthropogenic forcings are included . Observed 20th century grid cell trends from Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit gridded surface temperature data set 2v  are inconsistent with simulated internal variability at the 10% significance level in around 80% of grid cells even using HadCM2 which was found to overestimate variability in 5-year mean temperatures at most latitudes . Sixty percent of grid cells were found to exhibit significant warming trends since 1951, a much larger number than expected by chance , and similar results apply when circulation-related variability is first regressed out . However, as discussed in the AR4 , when a global field significance test is applied, this becomes a global detection study; since not all grid cells exhibit significant warming trends the overall interpretation of the results in terms of attribution at individual locations remains problematic. Mahlstein et al.  find significant changes in summer season temperatures in about 40% of low-latitude and about 20% of	0
extratropical land grid cells with sufficient observations, when testing against the null hypothesis of no change in the distribution of summer temperatures. Observed grid cell trends are compared with CMIP5 simulated trends in Figure 10.2i, which shows that in the great majority  of grid cells with sufficient observational coverage, observed trends over the 1901-2010 period are inconsistent with a combination of simulated internal variability and the response to natural forcings . Knutson et al.  find some deficiencies in the simulation of multi-decadal variability at the grid cell scale in CMIP5 models, but demonstrate that trends at more than 75% of individual grid cells with sufficient observational coverage in HadCRUT4 are inconsistent with the simulated response to natural forcings alone, and consistent or larger than the simulated response to combined anthropogenic and natural forcings in CMIP5 models. In summary, it is likely that anthropogenic forcing has made a substantial contribution to the warming of each of the inhabited continents since 1950. For Antarctica large observational uncertainties result in low confidence that anthropogenic influence has contributed to the observed warming averaged over available stations. Anthropogenic influence has likely contributed to temperature change in many sub-continental regions. Detection and attribution of climate change at continental and smaller scales is more difficult than at the global scale due to the greater contribution of internal variability, the greater difficulty of distinguishing between different causal factors, and greater errors in climate models' representation of regional details. Nevertheless, statistically significant warming trends are observed at a majority of grid cells, and the observed warming is inconsistent with estimates of possible warming due to natural causes at the great majority of grid cells with sufficient observational coverage.	0
10.3.1.2 Atmosphere This section presents an assessment of the causes of global and regional temperature changes in the free atmosphere. In AR4, Hegerl et al.  concluded that `the observed pattern of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling is very likely due to the influence of anthropogenic forcing, particularly greenhouse gases and stratospheric ozone depletion.' Since AR4, insight has been gained into regional aspects of free tropospheric trends and the causes of observed changes in stratospheric temperature. Atmospheric temperature trends through the depth of the atmosphere offer the possibility of separating the effects of multiple climate forcings, as climate model simulations indicate that each external forcing produces a different characteristic vertical and zonal pattern of temperature response . GHG forcing is expected to warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. Stratospheric ozone depletion cools the stratosphere, with the cooling being most pronounced in the polar regions. Its effect on tropospheric temperatures is small, which is consistent with a small estimated RF of stratospheric ozone changes . Tropospheric ozone increase, on the other hand, causes tropospheric warming. Reflective aerosols like sulphate cool the troposphere while absorbing aerosols like BC have a warming effect. Free atmosphere temperatures are also affected by natural forcings: solar	0
10.3.1.2.1 Tropospheric temperature change Chapter 2 concludes that it is virtually certain that globally the troposphere has warmed since the mid-twentieth century with only medium  to low confidence  in the rate and vertical structure of these changes. During the satellite era CMIP3 and CMIP5 models tend to warm faster than observations specifically in the tropics ; however, because of the large uncertainties in observed tropical temperature trends ; Figures 2.26 and Figure 2.27) there is only low confidence in this assessment . Outside the tropics, and over the period of the radiosonde record beginning in 1961, the discrepancy between simulated and observed trends is smaller . Specifically there is better agreement between observed trends and CMIP5 model trends for the NH extratropics . Factors other than observational uncertainties that contribute to inconsistencies between observed and simulated free troposphere warming include specific manifestation of natural variability in the observed coupled atmosphere-ocean system, forcing errors incorporated in the historical simulations and model response errors . Utilizing a subset of CMIP5 models with single forcing experiments extending until 2010, Lott et al.  detect influences of both human induced GHG increase and other anthropogenic forcings  in the spatio-temporal changes in tropospheric temperatures from 1961 to 2010 estimated from radiosonde observations. Figure 10.8 illustrates that a subsample of CMIP5 models  forced with both anthropogenic and natural climate drivers  exhibit trends that are consistent with radiosonde records in the troposphere up to about 300 hPa, albeit with a tendency for this subset of models to warm more than the observations. This finding is seen in near-globally averaged data  , as well as in latitudinal bands of the SH extratropics , tropics  and the NH extratropics . Figure 10.8 also illustrates that it is very unlikely that natural forcings alone could have caused the observed warming of tropospheric temperatures . The ensembles with both anthropogenic and natural forcings  and with GHG forcings only  are not clearly separated. This could be due to cancellation of the effects of increases in reflecting aerosols, which cool the troposphere, and absorbing aerosol  and tropospheric ozone, which both warm the troposphere. Above 300 hPa the three radiosonde data sets exhibit a larger spread as a result of larger uncertainties in the observational record . In this region of the upper troposphere simulated CMIP5 temperature trends tend to be more positive than observed trends . Further, an assessment of causes of observed trends in the upper troposphere is less confident than an assessment of overall atmospheric temperature changes because of observational uncertainties and potential remain891	0
ing systematic biases in observational data sets in this region . An analysis of contributions of natural and anthropogenic forcings to more recent trends from 1979 to 2010  is less robust because of increased uncertainty in observed trends ) as well as decreased capability to separate between individual forcings ensembles. One approach to identify a climate change signal in a time series is the analysis of the ratio between the amplitude of the observed signal of change divided by the magnitude of internal variability, in other words the S/N ratio of the data record. The S/N ratio represents the result of a non-optimal fingerprint analysis . For changes in the lower stratospheric temperature between 1979 and 2011, S/N ratios vary from 26 to 36, depending on the choice of observational data set. In the lower troposphere, the fingerprint strength in observations is smaller, but S/N ratios are still significant at the 1% level or better, and range from 3 to 8. There is no evidence that these ratios are spuriously inflated by model variability errors. After all global mean signals are removed, model fingerprints remain identifiable in 70% of the tests involving tropospheric temperature changes . Hegerl et al.  concluded that increasing GHGs are the main cause for warming of the troposphere. This result is supported by a 892	0
10.3.1.2.2 Stratospheric temperature change Lower stratospheric temperatures have not evolved uniformly over the period since 1958 when the stratosphere has been observed with sufficient regularity and spatial coverage. A long-term global cooling trend is interrupted by three 2-year warming episodes following large volcanic eruptions . During the satellite period the cooling evolved mainly in two steps occurring in the aftermath of the El Chichon eruption in 1982 and the Mt Pinatubo eruption of 1991, with each cooling transition being followed by a period of relatively steady temperatures . Since the mid1990s little net change has occurred in lower stratospheric temperatures . Since AR4, progress has been made in simulating the observed evolution of global mean lower stratospheric temperature. On the one hand, this has been achieved by using models with an improved	0
representation of stratospheric processes . It is found that in these models which have an upper boundary above the stratopause with an altitude of about 50 km  and improved stratospheric physics, variability of lower stratosphere climate in general is well simulated  whereas in so-called low-top models  it is generally underestimated . On the other hand, CMIP5 models all include changes in stratospheric ozone  whereas only about half of the models participating in CMIP3 include stratospheric ozone changes . A comparison of a low-top and high-top version of the HadGEM2 model shows detectable differences in modelled temperature changes, particularly in the lower tropical stratosphere, with the high-top version's simulation of temperature trends in the tropical troposphere in better agreement with radiosondes and reanalyses over 1981-2010 . CMIP5 models forced with changes in WMGHGs and stratospheric ozone as well as with changes in solar irradiance and volcanic aerosol forcings simulate the evolution of observed global mean lower stratospheric temperatures over the satellite era reasonably well although they tend to underestimate the long-term cooling trend . Compared with radiosonde data the cooling trend is also underestimated in a subset of CMIP5 simulations over the period 1961-2010  and in CMIP3 models over the 1958-1999 period . Potential causes for biases in lower stratosphere temperature trends are observational uncertainties  and forcing errors related to prescribed stratospheric aerosol loadings and stratospheric ozone changes affecting the tropical lower stratosphere . Since AR4, attribution studies have improved our knowledge of the role of anthropogenic and natural forcings in observed lower stratospheric temperature change. Gillett et al.  use the suite of chemistry climate model simulations carried out as part of the Chemistry Climate Model Validation  activity phase 2 for an attribution study of observed changes in stratospheric zonal mean temperatures. Chemistry-climate models prescribe changes in ozone-depleting substances  and ozone changes are calculated interactively. Gillett et al.  partition 1979-2005 Microwave Sounding Unit  lower stratospheric temperature trends into ODS-induced and GHG-induced changes and find that both ODSs and natural forcing contributed to the observed stratospheric cooling in the lower stratosphere with the impact of ODS dominating. The influence of GHGs on stratospheric temperature could not be detected independently of ODSs. The step-like cooling of the lower stratosphere can only be explained by the combined effects of changes in both anthropogenic and natural factors . Although the anthropogenic factors  cause the overall cooling, the natural factors  modulate the evolution of the cooling  with temporal variability of global mean ozone contributing to the step-like temperature evolution .	0
Models disagree with observations for seasonally varying changes in the strength of the Brewer-Dobson circulation in the lower stratosphere  which has been linked to zonal and seasonal patterns of changes in lower stratospheric temperatures . One robust feature is the observed cooling in spring over the Antarctic, which is simulated in response to stratospheric ozone depletion in climate models , although this has not been the subject of a formal detection and attribution study. Since AR4, progress has been made in simulating the response of global mean lower stratosphere temperatures to natural and anthropogenic forcings by improving the representation of climate forcings and utilizing models that include more stratospheric processes. New detection and attribution studies of lower stratospheric temperature changes made since AR4 support an assessment that it is very likely that anthropogenic forcing, dominated by stratospheric ozone depletion due to ozone-depleting substances, has led to a detectable cooling of the lower stratosphere since 1979.	0
10.3.1.2.3 Overall atmospheric temperature change When temperature trends from the troposphere and stratosphere are analysed together, detection and attribution studies using CMIP5 models show robust detections of the effects of GHGs and other anthropogenic forcings on the distinctive fingerprint of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling seen since 1961 in radiosonde data . Combining the evidence from free atmosphere changes from both troposphere and stratosphere shows an increased confidence in the attribution of free atmosphere temperature changes compared to AR4 owing to improved understanding of stratospheric temperature changes. There is therefore stronger evidence than at the time of AR4 to support the conclusion that it is very likely that anthropogenic forcing, particularly GHGs and stratospheric ozone depletion, has led to a detectable observed pattern of tropospheric warming and lower stratospheric cooling since 1961.	0
FAQ 10.1 | Climate Is Always Changing. How Do We Determine the Causes of Observed Changes? The causes of observed long-term changes in climate  are assessed by determining whether the expected `fingerprints' of different causes of climate change are present in the historical record. These fingerprints are derived from computer model simulations of the different patterns of climate change caused by individual climate forcings. On multi-decade time scales, these forcings include processes such as greenhouse gas increases or changes in solar brightness. By comparing the simulated fingerprint patterns with observed climate changes, we can determine whether observed changes are best explained by those fingerprint patterns, or by natural variability, which occurs without any forcing. The fingerprint of human-caused greenhouse gas increases is clearly apparent in the pattern of observed 20th century climate change. The observed change cannot be otherwise explained by the fingerprints of natural forcings or natural variability simulated by climate models. Attribution studies therefore support the conclusion that `it is extremely likely that human activities have caused more than half of the observed increase in global mean surface temperatures from 1951 to 2010.' The Earth's climate is always changing, and that can occur for many reasons. To determine the principal causes of observed changes, we must first ascertain whether an observed change in climate is different from other fluctuations that occur without any forcing at all. Climate variability without forcing--called internal variability--is the consequence of processes within the climate system. Large-scale oceanic variability, such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation  fluctuations in the Pacific Ocean, is the dominant source of internal climate variability on decadal to centennial time scales.	0
Climate change can also result from natural forcings external to the climate system, such as volcanic eruptions, or changes in the brightness of the sun. Forcings such as these are responsible for the huge changes in climate that are clearly documented in the geological record. Human-caused forcings include greenhouse gas emissions or atmospheric particulate pollution. Any of these forcings, natural or human caused, could affect internal variability as well as causing a change in average climate. Attribution studies attempt to determine the causes of a detected change in observed climate. Over the past century we know that global average temperature has increased, so if the observed change is forced then the principal forcing must be one that causes warming, not cooling. Formal climate change attribution studies are carried out using controlled experiments with climate models. The model-simulated responses to specific climate forcings are often called the fingerprints of those forcings. A climate model must reliably simulate the fingerprint patterns associated with individual forcings, as well as the patterns of unforced internal variability, in order to yield a meaningful climate change attribution assessment. No model can perfectly reproduce all features of climate, but many detailed studies indicate that simulations using current models are indeed sufficiently reliable to carry out attribution assessments. FAQ 10.1, Figure 1 illustrates part of a fingerprint assessment of global temperature change at the surface during the late 20th century. The observed change in the latter half of the 20th century, shown by the black time series in the left panels, is larger than expected from just internal variability. Simulations driven only by natural forcings  fail to reproduce late 20th century global warming at the surface with a spatial pattern of change  completely different from the observed pattern of change . Simulations including both natural and human-caused forcings provide a much better representation of the time rate of change  and spatial pattern  of observed surface temperature change. Both panels on the left show that computer models reproduce the naturally forced surface cooling observed for a year or two after major volcanic eruptions, such as occurred in 1982 and 1991. Natural forcing simulations capture the short-lived temperature changes following eruptions, but only the natural + human caused forcing simulations simulate the longer-lived warming trend. A more complete attribution assessment would examine temperature above the surface, and possibly other climate variables, in addition to the surface temperature results shown in FAQ 10.1, Figure 1. The fingerprint patterns associated with individual forcings become easier to distinguish when more variables are considered in the assessment. 	0
Overall, FAQ 10.1, Figure 1 shows that the pattern of observed temperature change is significantly different than the pattern of response to natural forcings alone. The simulated response to all forcings, including human-caused forcings, provides a good match to the observed changes at the surface. We cannot correctly simulate recent observed climate change without including the response to human-caused forcings, including greenhouse gases, stratospheric ozone, and aerosols. Natural causes of change are still at work in the climate system, but recent trends in temperature are largely attributable to human-caused forcing.	0

cited in this section, use less formal detection and attribution criteria than are often used for assessments of temperature change, owing to difficulties defining large-scale fingerprint patterns of hydrologic change in models and isolating those fingerprints in data. For example, correlations between observed hydrologic changes and the patterns of change in models forced by increasing GHGs can provide suggestive evidence towards attribution of change. Since the publication of AR4, in situ hydrologic data sets have been reanalysed with more stringent quality control. Satellite-derived data records of worldwide water vapour and precipitation variations have 895	0
In situ surface humidity measurements have been reprocessed since AR4 to create new gridded analyses for climatic research, as discussed in Chapter 2. The HadCRUH Surface Humidity data set  indicates significant increases in surface specific humidity between 1973 and 2003 averaged over the globe, the tropics, and the NH, with consistently larger trends in the tropics and in the NH during summer, and negative or non significant trends in relative humidity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the distribution of relative humidity should remain roughly constant under climate change . Simulations of the response to historical anthropogenic and natural forcings robustly generate an increase in atmospheric humidity consistent with observations . A recent cessation of the upward trend in specific humidity is observed over multiple continental areas in HadCRUH and is also found in the European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecast  interim reanalysis of the global atmosphere and surface conditions . This change in the specific humidity trend is temporally correlated with a levelling off of global ocean temperatures following the 1997-1998 El Nino event . The anthropogenic water vapour fingerprint simulated by an ensemble of 22 climate models has been identified in lower tropospheric moisture content estimates derived from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager  data covering the period 1988-2006 . Santer et al.  find that detection of an anthropogenic response in column water vapour is insensitive to the set of models used. They rank models based on their ability to simulate the observed mean total column water vapour, and its annual cycle and variability associated with ENSO. They report no appreciable differences between the fingerprints or detection results derived from the best or worst performing models, and so conclude that attribution of water vapour changes to anthropogenic forcing is not sensitive to the choice of models used for the assessment. In summary, an anthropogenic contribution to increases in specific humidity at and near the Earth's surface is found with medium confidence. Evidence of a recent levelling off of the long-term surface atmospheric moistening trend over land needs to be better understood and simulated as a prerequisite to increased confidence in attribution studies of water vapour changes. Length and quality of observational humidity data sets, especially above the surface, continue to limit detection and attribution studies of atmospheric water vapour.	0
identified from CMIP3 models . The AR4 concluded that `the latitudinal pattern of change in land precipitation and observed increases in heavy precipitation over the 20th century appear to be consistent with the anticipated response to anthropogenic forcing'. Detection and attribution of regional precipitation changes generally focuses on continental areas using in situ data because observational coverage over oceans is limited to a few island stations  , although model-data comparisons over continents also illustrate large observational uncertainties . Available satellite data sets that could supplement oceanic studies are short and their long-term homogeneity is still unclear ; hence they have not yet been used for detection and attribution of changes. Continuing uncertainties in climate model simulations of precipitation make quantitative model/data comparisons difficult , which also limits confidence in detection and attribution. Furthermore, sparse observational coverage of precipitation across much of the planet makes the fingerprint of precipitation change challenging to isolate in observational records . Considering just land regions with sufficient observations, the largest signal of differences between models with and without anthropogenic forcings is in the high latitudes of the NH, where increases in precipitation are a robust feature of climate model simulations . Such increases have been observed  in several different observational data sets , although high-latitude trends vary between data sets and with coverage . Attribution of zonally averaged precipitation trends has been attempted using different observational products and ensembles of forced simulations from both the CMIP3 and CMIP5 archives, for annual-averaged  and season-specific  results . Zhang et al.  identify the fingerprint of anthropogenic changes in observed annual zonal mean precipitation averaged over the periods 1925-1999 and 1950-1999, and separate the anthropogenic fingerprint from the influence of natural forcing. The fingerprint of external forcing is also detected in seasonal means for boreal spring in all data sets assessed by Noake et al. , and in all but one data set assessed by Polson et al.  , and in boreal winter in all but one data set , over the period 1951-1999 and to 2005. The fingerprint features increasing high-latitude precipitation, and decreasing precipitation trends in parts of the tropics that are reasonably robustly observed in all four data sets considered albeit with large observational uncertainties north of 60N . Detection of seasonal-average precipitation change is less convincing for June, July, August  and September, October, November  and results vary with observation data set . Although Zhang et al.  detect anthropogenic changes even if a separate fingerprint for natural forcings is considered, Polson et al.  find that this result is sensitive to the data set used and that the fingerprints can be separated robustly only for the data set most closely constrained by station data. The analysis also finds that model simulated precipitation variability is smaller than observed variability in the tropics (Zhang et al., 2007;	0
are expressed as a percentage of climatological precipitation and that the observed and simulated changes are largely consistent between CMIP5 models and observations given data uncertainty. Use of additional data sets illustrates remaining observational uncertainty in high latitudes of the NH . Regional-scale attribution of precipitation change is still problematic although regional climate models have yielded simulations consistent with observed wintertime changes for northern Europe . Precipitation change over ocean has been attributed to human influence by Fyfe et al.  for the high-latitude SH in austral summer, where zonally averaged precipitation has declined around 45S and increased around 60S since 1957, consistent with CMIP5 historical simulations, with the magnitude of the half-century trend outside the range of simulated natural variability. Confidence in this attribution result, despite limitations in precipitation observations, is enhanced by its consistency with trends in large-scale sea level pressure data .	0

This subsection assesses recent research on detection and attribution of long-term changes in continental surface hydrologic variables, including soil moisture, evapotranspiration and streamflow. Streamflows are often subject to large non-climatic human influence, such as diversions and land use changes, that must be accounted for in order to attribute detected hydrologic changes to climate change. Cryospheric aspects of surface hydrology are discussed in Section 10.5; extremes in surface hydrology  and precipitation are covered in Section 10.6.1. The variables discussed here are subject to large modeling uncertainties  and observational challenges , which in combination place severe limits on climate change detection and attribution. Direct observational records of soil moisture and surface fluxes tend to be sparse and/or short, thus limiting recent assessments of change in these variables . Assimilated land surface data sets and new satellite observations  are promising tools, but assessment of past and future climate change of these variables  is still generally carried out on derived quantities such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index, as discussed more fully in Section 10.6.1. Recent observations  show regional trends towards drier soils. An optimal detection analysis of reconstructed evapotranspiration identifies the effects of anthropogenic forcing on evapotranspiration, with the Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques -CM5 model simulating changes consistent with those estimated to have occurred . 897	0

The atmospheric circulation is driven by various processes including the uneven heating of the Earth's surface by solar radiation, land-sea contrast and orography. The circulation transports heat from warm to cold regions and thereby acts to reduce temperature contrasts. Thus, changes in circulation and in patterns of variability are of critical importance for the climate system, influencing regional climate and regional climate variability. Any such changes are important for local climate change because they could act to reinforce or counteract the effects of external forcings on climate in a particular region. Observed changes in atmospheric circulation and patterns of variability are assessed in Section 2.7.5. Although new and improved data sets are now available, changes in patterns of variability remain difficult to detect because of large variability on interannual to decadal time scales . Since AR4, progress has been made in understanding the causes of changes in circulation-related climate phenomena and modes of variability such as the width of the tropical circulation, and the Southern Annular Mode . For other climate phenomena, such as ENSO, Indian Ocean Dipole , Pacific Decadal Oscillation , and monsoons, there are large observational and modelling uncertainties , and there is low confidence that changes in these phenomena, if observed, can be attributed to human-induced influence.	0
is greater than determined from CMIP3 and CMIP5 simulations . The causes as to why models underestimate the observed poleward expansion of the tropical belt are not fully understood. Potential factors are lack of understanding of the magnitude of natural variability as well as changes in observing systems that also affect reanalysis products . Climate model simulations suggest that Antarctic ozone depletion is a major factor in causing poleward expansion of the southern Hadley cell during austral summer over the last three to five decades with GHGs also playing a role . In reanalysis data a detectable signal of ozone forcing is separable from other external forcing including GHGs when utilizing both CMIP5 and CMIP3 simulations combined . An analysis of CMIP3 simulations suggests that BC aerosols and tropospheric ozone were the main drivers of the observed poleward expansion of the northern Hadley cell in boreal summer . It is found that global greenhouse warming causes increase in static stability, such that the onset of baroclinicity is shifted poleward, leading to poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation . Tropical SST increase may also contribute to a widening of the Hadley circulation . Althoughe some Atmospheric General Circulation Model  simulations forced by observed time-varying SSTs yield a widening by about 1 in latitude over 1979-2002 , other simulations suggest that SST changes have little effect on the tropical expansion when based on the tropopause metric of the tropical width . However, it is found that the tropopause metric is not	0

The NAO, which exhibited a positive trend from the 1960s to the 1990s, has since exhibited lower values, with exceptionally low anomalies in the winters of 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 . This means that the positive trend in the NAO discussed in the AR4 has considerably weakened when evaluated up to 2011. Similar results apply to the closely related Northern Annular Mode , with its upward trend over the past 60 years in the 20th Century Reanalysis  and in Hadley Centre Sea Level Pressure data set 2r  not being significant compared to internal variability . An analysis of CMIP5 models shows that they simulate positive trends in NAM in the DJF season over this period, albeit not as large as those observed which are still within the range of natural internal variability . Other work  demonstrates that while the NAM is largely barotropic in structure, the simulated response to anthropogenic forcing has a strong baroclinic component, with an opposite geopotential height trends in the mid-troposphere compared to the surface in many models. Thus while the circulation response to anthropogenic forcing may project onto the NAM, it is not entirely captured by the NAM index. Consistent with previous findings , Gillett and Fyfe  find that GHGs tend to drive a positive NAM response in the CMIP5 models. Recent modelling work also indicates that ozone changes drive a small positive NAM response in spring .	0
10.3.3.3 Southern Annular Mode The Southern Annular Mode  index has remained mainly positive since the publication of the AR4, although it has not been as strongly positive as in the late 1990s. Nonetheless, an index of the SAM shows a significant positive trend in most seasons and data sets over the 1951-2011 period . Recent modelling studies confirm earlier findings that the increase in GHG concentrations tends to lead to a strengthening and poleward shift of the SH eddy-driven polar jet  which projects onto the positive phase of the SAM. Stratospheric ozone depletion also induces a strengthening and poleward shift of the polar jet in models, with the largest response in austral summer (Karpechko et al., 2008; Son et al., 2008, 2010; McLandress 900	0

Sigmond et al.  find approximately equal contributions to simulated annual mean SAM trends from GHGs and stratospheric ozone depletion up to the present.

Roscoe and Haigh  apply a regression-based approach and find that stratospheric ozone changes are the primary driver of observed trends in the SAM. Observed trends are also consistent with CMIP3 simulations including stratospheric ozone changes in all seasons, though in MAM observed trends are roughly twice as large as those simulated .

10.3.3.4 Change in Global Sea Level Pressure Patterns A number of studies have applied formal detection and attribution studies to global fields of atmospheric SLP finding detection of human influence on global patterns of SLP . Analysing the contributions of different forcings to observed changes in SLP, Gillett and Stott  find separately detectable influences of anthropogenic and natural forcings in zonal mean seasonal mean SLP, strengthening evidence for a human influence on SLP. Based on the robustness of the evidence from multiple models we conclude that it is likely that human influence has altered SLP patterns globally since 1951.	0
The oceans are a key part of the Earth's energy balance . Observational studies continue to demonstrate that the ocean heat content has increased in the upper layers of the ocean during the second half of the 20th century and early 21st century , and that this increase is consistent with a net positive radiative imbalance in the climate system. It is of significance that this heat content increase is an order of magnitude larger than the increase in energy content of any other component of the Earth's ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere system and accounts for more than 90% of the Earth's energy increase between 1971 and 2010 . Despite the evidence for anthropogenic warming of the ocean, the level of confidence in the conclusions of the AR4 report--that the warming of the upper several hundred meters of the ocean during the second half of the 20th century was likely to be due to anthropogenic forcing--reflected the level of uncertainties at that time. The major uncertainty was an apparently large decadal variability  in the observational estimates that was not simulated by climate models . The large decadal variability in observations raised concerns about the capacity of climate models to simulate observed variability. There were also lingering concerns about the presence of non-climate-related biases in the observations of ocean heat content	0
change . After the IPCC AR4 report in 2007, time-and depth-dependent systematic errors in bathythermograph temperatures were discovered . Bathythermograph data account for a large fraction of the historical temperature observations and are therefore a source of bias in ocean heat content studies. Bias corrections were then developed and applied to observations. With the newer bias-corrected estimates , it became obvious that the large decadal variability in earlier estimates of global upper-ocean heat content was an observational artefact . The interannual to decadal variability of ocean temperature simulated by the CMIP3 models agrees better with observations when the model data is sampled using the observational data mask . In the upper 700 m, CMIP3 model simulations agreed more closely with observational estimates of global ocean heat content based on bias-corrected ocean temperature data, both in terms of the decadal variability and multi-decadal trend  when forced with the most complete set of natural and anthropogenic forcings . For the simulations with the most complete set of forcings, the multi-model ensemble mean trend was only 10% smaller than observed for 1961-1999. Model simulations that included only anthropogenic forcing  significantly overestimate the multi-decadal trend and underestimate decadal variability. This overestimate of the trend is partially caused by the ocean's response to volcanic eruptions, which results in rapid cooling followed by decadal or longer time variations during the recovery phase. Although it has been suggested  that the cooling trend from successive volcanic events is an artefact because models were not spun up with volcanic forcing, this discrepancy is not expected to be as significant in the upper ocean as in the deeper layers where longer term adjustments take place . Thus for the upper ocean, there is high confidence that the more frequent eruptions during the second half of the 20th century have caused a multi-decadal cooling that partially offsets the anthropogenic warming and contributes to the apparent decadal variability . Gleckler et al.  examined the detection and attribution of upperocean warming in the context of uncertainties in the underlying observational data sets, models and methods. Using three bias-corrected observational estimates of upper-ocean temperature changes  and models from the CMIP3 multi-model archive, they found that multi-decadal trends in the observations were best understood by including contributions from both natural and anthropogenic forcings. The anthropogenic fingerprint in observed upper-ocean warming, driven by global mean and basin-scale pattern changes, was also detected. The strength of this signal  crossed the 5% and 1% significance threshold in 1980 and progressively becomes more strongly detected for longer trend periods , for all ocean heat content time series. This stronger detection for longer periods occurs because the noise (standard deviation of trends in the unforced chang901	0

Attribution to anthropogenic warming from recent detection and attribution studies  have made use of new bias-corrected observations and have systematically explored methodological uncertainties, yielding more confidence in the results. With greater consistency and agreement across observational data sets and resolution of structural issues, the major uncertainties at the time of AR4 have now largely been resolved. The high levels of confidence and the increased understanding of the contributions from both natural and anthropogenic sources across the many studies mean that it is very likely that the increase in global ocean heat content observed in the upper 700 m since the 1970s has a substantial contribution from anthropogenic forcing.	0
Although there is high confidence in understanding the causes of global heat content increases, attribution of regional heat content changes are less certain. Earlier regional studies used a fixed depth data and only considered basin-scale averages . At regional scales, however, changes in advection of ocean heat are important and need to be isolated from changes due to air-sea heat fluxes . Their fixed isotherm  approach to optimal detection analysis, in addition to being largely insensitive to observational biases, is designed to separate the ocean's response to air-sea flux changes from advective changes. Air- sea fluxes are the primary mechanism by which the oceans are expected to respond to externally forced anthropogenic and natural volcanic influences. The finer temporal resolution of the analysis allowed Palmer et al.  to attribute distinct short-lived cooling episodes to major volcanic eruptions while, at multi-decadal time scales, a more spatially uniform near-surface  warming pattern was detected across all ocean basins  and attributed to anthropogenic causes at the 5% significance level. Considering that individual ocean basins are affected by different observational and modelling uncertainties and that internal variability is larger at smaller scales, detection of significant anthropogenic forcing through space and time studies  provides more compelling evidence of human influence at regional scales of near-surface ocean warming observed during the second half of the 20th century.	0
The 50-year trends in surface salinity show that there is a strong positive correlation between the mean climate of the surface salinity and its temporal changes from 1950 to 2000 . The correlation between the climate and the trends in surface salinity of 0.7 implies that fresh surface waters get fresher, and salty waters get saltier . Such patterns of surface salinity change are also found in Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models  simulations both for the 20th century and projected future changes into the 21st century . The pattern of temporal change in observations from CMIP3 simulations is particularly strong for those projections using Special Report on Emission Scenarios  with larger global warming changes . For the period 1950-2000 the observed amplification of the surface salinity is 16  10% per C of warming and is twice the simulated surface salinity change in CMIP3 models. This difference between the surface salinity amplification is plausibly caused by the tendency of CMIP3 ocean models mixing surface salinity into deeper layers and consequently surface salinity increases at a slower rate than observed . Although there are now many established observed long-term trends of salinity change at the ocean surface and within the interior ocean at regional and global scales , there are relatively few studies that attribute these changes formally to anthropogenic forcing. Analysis at the regional scale of the observed recent surface salinity increases in the North Atlantic  show a small signal that could be attributed to anthropogenic forcings but for this ocean is not significant compared with internal variability . On a larger spatial scale, the surface salinity patterns in the band from 30S to 50N show anthropogenic contributions that are larger than the 5 to 95% uncertainty range . The strongest signals that can be attributed to anthropogenic forcing are in the tropics  and the western Pacific. These results also show the salinity contrast between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans is also enhanced with significant contributions from anthropogenic forcing. 903	0

On a global scale surface and subsurface salinity changes  over the upper 250 m of the water column cannot be explained by natural variability  . However, the observed salinity changes match the model distribution of forced changes , with the observations typically falling between the 25th and 75th percentile of the model distribution at all depth levels for salinity . Natural external variability taken from the simulations with just solar and volcanic variations in forcing do not match the observations at all, thus excluding the hypothesis that observed trends can be explained by just solar or volcanic variations. The results from surface salinity trends and changes are consistent with the results from studies of precipitation over the tropical ocean from the shorter satellite record . These surface salinity results are also consistent with our understanding of the thermodynamic response of the atmosphere to warming  and the amplification of the water cycle. The large number of studies showing patterns of change consistent with amplification of the water cycle, and the detection and attribution studies for the tropical oceans  and the global pattern of ocean salinity change , when combined with our understanding of the physics of the water cycle and estimates of internal climate variability, give high confidence in our understanding of the drivers of surface and near surface salinity changes. It is very likely that these salinity changes have a discernable contribution from anthropogenic forcing since the 1960s.	0
At the time of the AR4, the historical sea level rise budget had not been closed , and there were few studies quantifying the contribution of anthropogenic forcing to the observed sea level rise and glacier melting. Relying on expert assessment, the AR4 had concluded based on modelling and ocean heat content studies that ocean warming and glacier mass loss had very likely contributed to sea level rise during the latter half of the 20th century. The AR4 had reported that climate models that included anthropogenic and natural forcings simulated the observed thermal expansion since 1961 reasonably well, and that it is very unlikely that the warming during the past half century is due only to known natural causes . Since the AR4, corrections applied to instrumental errors in ocean temperature measurements have considerably improved estimates of upper-ocean heat content , and therefore ocean thermal expansion. Closure of the global mean sea level rise budget as an evolving time series since the early1970s  indicates that the two major contributions to the rate of global mean sea level rise have been thermal expansion and glacier melting with additional contributions from Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Observations since 1971 indicate with high confidence that thermal expansion and glaciers  explain 75% of the observed rise . Ice sheet contributions remain the greatest source of uncertainty over this period and on longer time scales. Over the 20th century, the global mean sea level rise budget  has been another important step in understanding the relative contributions of different drivers.	0
The observed contribution from thermal expansion is well captured in climate model simulations with historical forcings as are contributions from glacier melt when simulated by glacier models driven by climate model simulations of historical climate . The model results indicate that most of the variation in the contributions of thermal expansion and glacier melt to global mean sea level is in response to natural and anthropogenic RFs . The strong physical relationship between thermosteric sea level and ocean heat content  means that the anthropogenic ocean warming  has contributed to global sea level rise over this period through thermal expansion. As Section 10.5.2 concludes, it is likely that the observed substantial mass loss of glaciers is due to human influence and that it is likely that anthropogenic forcing and internal variability are both contributors to recent observed changes on the Greenland ice sheet. The causes of recently observed Antarctic ice sheet contribution to sea level are less clear due to the short observational record and incomplete understanding of natural variability. Taking the causes of Greenland ice sheet melt and glacier mass loss together , it is concluded with high confidence that it is likely that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to sea level rise from melting glaciers and ice sheets. Combining the evidence from ocean warming and mass loss of glaciers we conclude that it is very likely that there is a substantial contribution from anthropogenic forcing to the global mean sea level rise since the 1970s. On ocean basin scales, detection and attribution studies do show the emergence of detectable signals in the thermosteric component of sea level that can be largely attributed to human influence . Regional changes in sea level at the subocean basin scales and finer exhibit more complex variations associated with natural  modes of climate variability . In some regions, sea level trends have been observed to differ significantly from global mean trends. These have been related to thermosteric changes in some areas and in others to changing wind fields and resulting changes in the ocean circulation . The regional variability on decadal and longer time scales can be quite large  compared to secular changes in the winds that influence sea level. Detection of human influences on sea level at the regional scale  is currently limited by the relatively small anthropogenic contributions compared to natural variability  and the need for more sophisticated approaches than currently available.	0
Mecking et al., 2006; Nakanowatari et al., 2007; Brandt et al., 2010) they all show a pattern of change consistent with the known ocean circulation and surface ventilation. A recent global analysis of oxygen data from the 1960s to 1990s for change confirm these earlier results and extends the spatial coverage from local to global scales . The strongest decreases in oxygen occur in the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, near regions where there is strong water renewal and exchange between the ocean interior and surface waters. The attribution study of oxygen decreases using two Earth System Models  concluded that observed changes for the Atlantic Ocean are `indistinguishable from natural internal variability'; however, the changes of the global zonal mean to external forcing  has a detectable influence at the 10% significance level . The chief sources of uncertainty are the paucity of oxygen observations, particularly in time, the precise role of the biological pump and changes in ocean productivity in the models , and model circulation biases particularly near the oxygen minimum zone in tropical waters . These results of observed changes in oxygen and the attribution studies of oxygen changes , along with the attribution of human influences on the physical factors that affect oxygen in the oceans such as surface temperatures changes , increased ocean heat content  and observed increased in ocean stratification  provides evidence for human influence on oxygen. When these lines of evidence are taken together it is concluded that with medium confidence or about as likely as not that the observed oxygen decreases can be attributed in part to human influences. The observed trends  for ocean acidification and its cause from rising CO2 concentrations is discussed in Section 3.8.2 . There is very high confidence that anthropogenic CO2 has resulted in the acidification of surface waters of between -0.0015 and -0.0024 pH units per year.	0
10.5.1 Sea Ice 10.5.1.1 Arctic and Antarctic Sea Ice The Arctic cryosphere shows large observed changes over the last decade as noted in Chapter 4 and many of these shifts are indicators of major regional and global feedback processes . An assessment of sea ice models` capacity to simulate Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent is given in Section 9.4.3. Of principal importance is `Arctic Amplification'  where surface temperatures in the Arctic are increasing faster than elsewhere in the world. The rate of decline of Arctic sea ice thickness and September sea ice extent has increased considerably in the first decade of the 21st century 	0
Based on a sea ice reanalysis and verified by ice thickness estimates from satellite sensors, it is estimated that three quarters of summer Arctic sea ice volume has been lost since the 1980s . There was also a rapid reduction in ice extent, to 37% less in September 2007 and to 49% less in September 2012 relative to the 1979-2000 climatology . Unlike the loss record set in 2007 that was dominated by a major shift in climatological winds, sea ice loss in 2012 was more due to a general thinning of the sea ice . All recent years have ice extents that fall at least two standard deviations below the long-term sea ice trend. The amount of old, thick multi-year sea ice in the Arctic has decreased by 50% from 2005 through 2012 . Sea ice has also become more mobile . We now have seven years of data that show sea ice conditions are substantially different to that observed prior to 2006. The relatively large increase in the percentage of first year sea ice across the Arctic basin can be considered `a new normal.' Confidence in detection of change comes in part from the consistency of multiple lines of evidence. Since AR4, evidence has continued to accumulate from a range of observational studies that systematic changes are occurring in the Arctic. Persistent trends in many Arctic variables, including sea ice, the timing of spring snow melt, increased shrubbiness in tundra regions, changes in permafrost, increased area of forest fires, changes in ecosystems, as well as Arctic-wide increases in air temperatures, can no longer be associated solely with the dominant climate variability patterns such as the Arctic Oscillation, Pacific North American pattern or Atlantic Meridional Oscillation  . Duarte et al.  completed a meta-analysis showing evidence from multiple indicators of detectable climate change signals in the Arctic. The increase in the magnitude of recent Arctic temperature and decrease in sea ice volume and extent are hypothesized to be due to coupled Arctic amplification mechanisms . These feedbacks in the Arctic climate system suggest that the Arctic is sensitive to external forcing . Historically, changes were damped by the rapid formation of sea ice in autumn causing a negative feedback and a rapid seasonal cooling. But recently, the increased mobility and loss of multiyear sea ice, combined with enhanced heat storage in the sea ice-free regions of the Arctic Ocean form a connected set of processes with positive feedbacks causing an increase in Arctic temperatures and a decrease in sea ice extent  . In addition to the well known ice albedo feedback where decreased sea ice cover decreases the amount of insolation reflected from the surface, there is a late summer/early autumn positive ice insulation feedback due to additional ocean heat storage in areas previously covered by sea ice	0
. Arctic amplification may also have a contribution from poleward heat transport in the atmosphere and ocean . It appears that recent Arctic changes are in response to a combination of global-scale warming, from warm anomalies from internal climate variability on different time scales, and are amplified from the multiple feedbacks described above. For example, when the 2007 sea ice minimum occurred, Arctic temperatures had been rising and sea ice extent had been decreasing over the previous two decades . Nevertheless, it took unusually persistent southerly winds along the dateline over the summer months to initiate the sea ice loss event in 2007 . Similar southerly wind patterns in previous years did not initiate major reductions in sea ice extent because the sea ice was too thick to respond . Increased oceanic heat transport through the Barents Sea in the first decade of the 21st century and the AMO on longer time scales may also have played a role in determining sea ice anomalies in the Atlantic Arctic  . Based on the evidence in the previous paragraphs there is high confidence that these Arctic amplification mechanisms are currently affecting regional Arctic climate. But it also suggests that the timing of future major sea ice loss events will be difficult to project. There is evidence therefore that internal variability of climate, long-term warming, and Arctic Amplification feedbacks have all contributed to recent decreases in Arctic sea ice . Turning to model-based attribution studies, Min et al.  compared the seasonal evolution of Arctic sea ice extent from observations with those simulated by multiple General Circulation Models  for 1953-2006. Comparing changes in both the amplitude and shape of the annual cycle of the sea ice extent reduces the chance of spurious detection due to coincidental agreement between the response to anthropogenic forcing and other factors, such as slow internal variability. They found that human influence on the sea ice extent changes has been robustly detected since the early 1990s. The anthropogenic signal is also detectable for individual months from May to December, suggesting that human influence, strongest in late summer, now also extends into colder seasons. Kay et al. , Jahn et al.  and Schweiger et al.  used the Community Climate System Model 4  to investigate the influence of anthropogenic forcing on late 20th century and early 21st century Arctic sea ice extent and volume trends. On all time scales examined , the most extreme negative extent trends observed in the late 20th century cannot be explained by modeled internal variability alone. Comparing trends from the CCSM4 ensemble to observed trends suggests that internal variability could account for approximately half of the observed 1979-2005 September Arctic sea ice extent loss. Attribution of anthropogenic forcing is also shown by comparing September sea ice extent as projected by seven models from the set of CMIP5 models' hindcasts to control runs without anthropogenic forcing . The mean of sea ice extents in seven models' ensemble members are below the level of their control runs by about 1995, similar to the result of Min et al. .	0
A question as recently as 6 years ago was whether the recent Arctic warming and sea ice loss was unique in the instrumental record and whether the observed trend would continue . Arctic temperature anomalies in the 1930s were apparently as large as those in the 1990s and 2000s. There is still considerable discussion of the ultimate causes of the warm temperature anomalies that occurred in the Arctic in the 1920s and 1930s . The early 20th century warm period, while reflected in the hemispheric average air temperature record , did not appear consistently in the mid-latitudes nor on the Pacific side of the Arctic . Polyakov et al.  argued that the Arctic air temperature records reflected a natural cycle of about 50 to 80 years. However, many authors  instead link the 1930s temperatures to internal variability in the North Atlantic atmospheric and ocean circulation as a single episode that was sustained by ocean and sea ice processes in the Arctic and north Atlantic. The Arctic-wide increases of temperature in the last decade contrast with the episodic regional increases in the early 20th century, suggesting that it is unlikely that recent increases are due to the same primary climate process as the early 20th century. In the case of the Arctic we have high confidence in observations since 1979, from models , and from physical understanding of the dominant processes; taking these three factors together it is very likely that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to the observed decreases in Arctic sea ice since 1979. Whereas sea ice extent in the Arctic has decreased, sea ice extent in the Antarctic has very likely increased . Sea ice extent across the SH over the year as a whole increased by 1.3 to 1.67% per decade from 1979 to 2012, with the largest increase in the Ross Sea during the autumn, while sea ice extent decreased in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea . The observed upward trend in Antarctic sea ice extent is found to be inconsistent with internal variability based on the residuals from a linear trend fitted to the observations, though this approach could underestimate multi-decadal variability . The CMIP5 simulations on average simulate a decrease in Antarctic sea ice extent , though Turner et al.  find that approximately 10% of CMIP5 simulations exhibit an increasing trend in Antarctic sea ice extent larger than observed over the 1979-2005 period. However, Antarctic sea ice extent variability appears on average to be too large in the CMIP5 models . Overall, the shortness of the observed record and differences in simulated and observed variability preclude an assessment of whether or not the observed increase in Antarctic sea ice extent is inconsistent with internal variability. Based on Figure 10.16b and Meehl et al. , the trend of Antarctic sea ice loss in simulations due to changes in forcing is weak  and the internal variability is high, and thus the time necessary for detection is longer than in the Arctic.	0

10.5.2.1 Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are important to regional and global climate because  they cause a polar amplification of surface temperatures, a source of fresh water to the ocean, and represent a source of potentially irreversible change to the state of the Earth system . These two ice sheets are important contributors to sea level rise representing two-thirds of the contributions from all ice covered regions . Observations of surface mass balance  are dealt with in Section 4.4.3 and ice sheet models are discussed in Sections 13.3 and 13.5. Attribution of change is difficult as ice sheet and glacier changes are local and ice sheet processes are not generally well represented in climate models thus precluding formal single-step detection and attribution studies. However, Greenland observational records show large recent changes. Section 13.3 concludes that regional models for Greenland can reproduce trends in the surface mass balance loss quite well if they are forced with the observed meteorological record, but not with forcings from a Global Climate Model. Regional model simulations  show that Greenland surface melt increases nonlinearly with rising temperatures due to the positive feedback between surface albedo and melt. There have been exceptional changes in Greenland since 2007 marked by record-setting high air temperatures, ice loss by melting and marine-terminating glacier area loss . Along Greenland's west coast temperatures in 2010 and 2011were the warmest since record keeping began in 1873 resulting in the highest observed melt rates in this region since 1958 . The annual rate of area loss in marine-terminating glaciers was 3.4 times that of the previous 8 years, when regular observations became available. In 2012, a new record for summertime ice mass loss was two standard deviations below the 2003-2012 mean, as estimated from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment  satellite . The trend of summer mass change during 2003-2012 is rather uniform over this period at -29  11 Gt yr-1. Record surface melts during 2007-2012 summers are linked to persistent atmospheric circulation that favored warm air advection over Greenland. These persistent events have changed in frequency since the beginning of the 2000s . Hanna et al.  show a weak relation of Greenland temperatures and ice sheet runoff with the AMO; they more strongly correlate with a Greenland atmospheric blocking index. Overland et al.  and Francis and Vavrus  suggest that the increased frequency of the Greenland blocking pattern is related to broader scale Arctic changes. Since 2007, internal variability is likely to have further enhanced the	0
melt over Greenland. Mass loss and melt is also occurring in Greenland through the intrusion of warm water into the major glaciers such as Jacobshaven Glacier . Hanna et al.  attribute increased Greenland runoff and melt since 1990 to global warming; southern Greenland coastal and NH summer temperatures were uncorrelated between the 1960s and early 1990s but correlated significantly positively thereafter. This relationship was modulated by the NAO, whose summer index significantly negatively correlated with southern Greenland summer temperatures until the early 1990s but not thereafter. Regional modelling and observations tell a consistent story of the response of Greenland temperatures and ice sheet runoff to shifts in recent regional atmospheric circulation associated with larger scale flow patterns and global temperature increases. It is likely that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet since 1993. There is clear evidence that the West Antarctic ice sheet is contributing to sea level rise . Estimates of ice mass in Antarctic since 2000 show that the greatest losses are at the edges . An analysis of observations underneath a floating ice shelf off West Antarctica shows that ocean warming and more transport of heat by ocean circulation are largely responsible for increasing melt rates . Antarctica has regionally dependent decadal variability in surface temperature with variations in these trends depending on the strength of the SAM climate pattern. Recent warming in continental west Antarctica has been linked to SST changes in the tropical Pacific . As with Antarctic sea ice, changes in Antarctic ice sheets have complex causes . The observational record of Antarctic mass loss is short and the internal variability of the ice sheet is poorly understood. Due to a low level of scientific understanding there is low confidence in attributing the causes of the observed loss of mass from the Antarctic ice sheet since 1993. Possible future instabilities in the west Antarctic ice sheet cannot be ruled out, but projection of future climate changes over West Antarctica remains subject to considerable uncertainty .	0
10.5.2.2 Glaciers In the 20th century, there is robust evidence that large-scale internal climate variability governs interannual to decadal variability in glacier mass  and, along with glacier dynamics, impacts glacier length as well . On time periods longer than years and decades, there is now evidence of recent ice loss  due to increased ambient temperatures and associated regional moisture changes. However, few studies evaluate the direct attribution of the current observed mass loss to anthropogenic forcing, owing to the difficulty associated with contrasting scales between glaciers and the large-scale atmospheric circulation . Reichert et al.  show for two sample sites at mid and high latitude that internal climate variability over multiple millennia as represented in a GCM would not result in such short glacier lengths as observed in the 20th century. For a sample site at low latitude using 909	0
multi-step attribution, Molg et al.   found a close relation between glacier mass loss and the externally forced atmosphere-ocean circulation in the Indian Ocean since the late 19th century. A second, larger group of studies makes use of century-scale glacier records  to extract evidence for external drivers. These include local and regional changes in precipitation and air temperature, and related parameters  estimated from the observed change in glaciers. In general these studies show that the glacier changes reveal unique departures since the 1970s, and that the inferred climatic drivers in the 20th century and particularly in most recent decades, exceed the variability of the earlier parts of the records . These results underline the contrast to former centuries where observed glacier fluctuations can be explained by internal climate variability . Anthropogenic land cover change is an unresolved forcing, but a first assessment suggests that it does not confound the impacts of recent temperature and precipitation changes if the land cover changes are of local nature . The robustness of the estimates of observed mass loss since the 1960s , the confidence we have in estimates of natural variations and internal variability from long-term glacier records, and our understanding of glacier response to climatic drivers provides robust evidence and, therefore, high confidence that a substantial part of the mass loss of glaciers is likely due to human influence.	0
10.5.3 Snow Cover Both satellite and in situ observations show significant reductions in the NH snow cover extent  over the past 90 years, with most reduction occurring in the 1980s . Formal detection and attribution studies have indicated anthropogenic influence on NH SCE  and western USA snow water equivalent . Pierce et al.  detected anthropogenic influence in the ratio of 1 April SWE over October to March precipitation over the period 1950-1999. These reductions could not be explained by natural internal climate variability alone, nor by changes in solar and volcanic forcing. In their analysis of NH SCE using 13 CMIP5 simulations over the 1922-2005 period, Rupp et al.  showed that some CMIP5 simulations with natural external and anthropogenic forcings could explain the observed decrease in spring SEC though the CMIP5 simulations with all forcing as a whole could only explain half of the magnitude of decrease, and that volcanic and solar variations  were inconsistent with observations. We conclude with high confidence in the observational and modelling evidence that the decrease in NH snow extent since the 1970s is likely to be caused by all external forcings and has an anthropogenic contribution .	0
Relatively warm seasonal mean temperatures  have seen a rapid increase in frequency for many regions worldwide  and an increase in the occurrence frequencies of unusually warm seasonal and annual mean temperatures has been attributed in part to human influence . A large amount of evidence supports changes in daily data based temperature extreme indices consistent with warming, despite different data sets or different methods for data processing having been used . The effects of human influence on daily temperature extremes is suggested by both qualitative and quantitative comparisons between observed and CMIP3 based modelled values of warm days and warm nights  and cold days and cold nights . Trends in temperature extreme indices computed for Australia  and the USA  using observations and simulations of the 20th century with nine GCMs that include both anthropogenic and natural forcings are found to be consistent. Both observations and model simulations show a decrease in the number of frost days, and an increase in the growing season length, heatwave duration and TN90p in the second half of the 20th century. Two of the models  with simulations that include only anthropogenic or only natural forcings	0
indicate that the observed changes are simulated with anthropogenic forcings, but not with natural forcings . Morak et al.  found that over many sub-continental regions, the number of warm nights  shows detectable changes over the second half of the 20th century that are consistent with model simulated changes in response to historical external forcings. They also found detectable changes in indices of temperature extremes when the data were analysed over the globe as a whole. As much of the long-term change in TN90p can be predicted based on the interannual correlation of TN90p with mean temperature, Morak et al.  conclude that the detectable changes are attributed in a multi-step approach  in part to GHG increases. Morak et al.  have extended this analysis to TX10p, TN10p, TX90p as well as TN90p, using fingerprints from HadGEM1 and find detectable changes on global scales and in many regions . Human influence has also been detected in two different measures of the intensity of extreme daily temperatures in a year. Zwiers et al.  compared four extreme temperature variables including warmest daily maximum and minimum temperatures (annual m  aximum	0
daily maximum and minimum temperatures, referred to as TXx, TNx) and coldest daily maximum and minimum temperatures  from observations and from simulations with anthropogenic forcing or anthropogenic and natural external forcings from seven GCMs. They consider these extreme daily temperatures to follow generalized extreme value  distributions with location, shape and scale parameters. They fit GEV distributions to the observed extreme temperatures with location parameters as linear functions of signals obtained from the model simulation. They found that both anthropogenic influence and combined influence of anthropogenic and natural forcing can be detected in all four extreme temperature variables at the global scale over the land, and also regionally over many large land areas . In a complementary study, Christidis et al.  used an optimal fingerprint method to compare observed and modelled time-varying location parameters of extreme temperature distributions. They detected the effects of anthropogenic forcing on warmest daily temperatures in a single fingerprint analysis, and were able to separate the effects of natural from anthropogenic forcings in a two fingerprint analysis.	0

The left side of each panel shows scaling factors and their 90% confidence intervals for intensity of annual extreme temperatures in response to external forcings for the period 1951-2000. TNn and TXn represent coldest daily minimum and maximum temperatures, respectively, while TNx and TXx represent warmest daily minimum and maximum temperatures . Fingerprints are based on simulations of climate models with both anthropogenic and natural forcings. Right-hand sides of each panel show scaling factors and their 90% confidence intervals for changes in the frequency of temperature extremes for winter , and summer half years.

TN90p and TX90p are the frequency of warm nights and days  with fingerprints based on simulations of Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model 1  with both anthropogenic and natural forcings. Detection is claimed at the 5% significance level if the 90% confidence interval of a scaling factor is entirely above the zero line. Grey represents regions with insufficient data.	0
Human influence on annual extremes of daily temperatures may be detected separately from natural forcing at the global scale  and also at continental and sub-continental scales . Over China, Wen et al.  showed that anthropogenic influence may be separately detected from that of natural forcing in daily extreme temperatures , although the influence of natural forcing is not detected, and they also showed that the influence of GHGs in these indices may be separately detected from other anthropogenic forcings. Christidis et al.  found that on a quasi-global scale, the cooling effect due to the decrease in tree cover and increase in grass cover since pre-industrial times as simulated by one ESM is detectable in the observed change of warm extremes. Urbanization may have also affected extreme temperatures in some regions; for example Zhou and Ren  found that extreme temperature warms more in rural stations than in urban sites in China. The effect of land use change and urban heat Island is found to be small in GMST . Consequently, this effect on extreme temperature is also expected to be small in the global average.	0
These new studies show that there is stronger evidence for anthropogenic forcing on changes in extreme temperatures than at the time of the SREX assessment. New evidence since SREX includes the separation of the influence of anthropogenic forcings from that of natural forcings on extreme daily temperatures at the global scale and to some extent at continental and sub-continental scales in some regions. These new results suggest more clearly the role of anthropogenic forcing on temperature extremes compared to results at the time of the SREX assessment. We assess that it is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century.	0
10.6.1.2 Precipitation Extremes Observations have showed a general increase in heavy precipitation at the global scale. This appears to be consistent with the expected response to anthropogenic forcing as a result of an enhanced moisture content in the atmosphere but a direct cause-and-effect relationship between changes in external forcing and extreme precipitation had not been established at the time of the AR4. As a result, the AR4 concluded that increases in heavy precipitation were more likely than not consistent with anthropogenic influence during the latter half of the 20th century . Extreme precipitation is expected to increase with warming. A combination of evidence leads to this conclusion though by how much remains uncertain and may vary with time scale . Observations and model projected future changes both indicate increase in extreme precipitation associated with warming. Analysis of observed annual maximum 1-day precipitation  over global land areas with sufficient data smaples indicates a significant increase in extreme percipitation globally, with a median increase about 7% C-1 GMST increase . CMIP3 and CMIP5 simulations project an increase in the globally averaged 20-year return values of annual maximum 24-hour precipitation amounts of about 6 to 7% with each degree Celsius of global mean warming, with the bulk of models simulating values in the range of 4 to 10% C-1. Anthropogenic influence has been detected on various 912	0
aspects of the global hydrological cycle , which is directly relevant to extreme precipitation changes. An anthropogenic influence on increasing atmospheric moisture content has been detected . A higher moisture content in the atmosphere would be expected to lead to stronger extreme precipitation as extreme precipitation typically scales with total column moisture if circulation does not change. An observational analysis shows that winter maximum daily precipitation in North America has statistically significant positive correlations with local atmospheric moisture . There is only a modest body of direct evidence that natural or anthropogenic forcing has affected global mean precipitation , despite a robust expectation of increased precipitation  and precipitation extremes . However, mean precipitation is expected to increase less than extreme precipitation because of energy constraints . A perfect model analysis with an ensemble of GCM simulations shows that anthropogenic influence should be detectable in precipitation extremes in the second half of the 20th century at global and hemispheric scales, and at continental scale as well but less robustly , see also Hegerl et al. . One study has also linked the observed intensification of precipitation extremes ) over NH land areas to human influence using a limited set of climate models and observations . However, the detection was less robust if using the fingerprint for combined anthropogenic and natural influences compared to that for anthropogenic influences only, possibly due to a number of factors including weak S/N ratio and uncertainties in observation and model simulations. Also, models still have difficulties in simulating extreme daily precipitation directly comparable with those observed at the station level, which has been addressed to some extent by Min et al.  by independently transforming annual precipitation extremes in models and observations onto a dimensionless scale that may be more comparable between the two. Detection of anthropogenic influence on smaller spatial scales is more difficult due to the increased level of noise and uncertainties and confounding factors on local scales. Fowler and Wilby  suggested that there may have only been a 50% likelihood of detecting anthropogenic influence on UK extreme precipitation in winter at that time, and a very small likelihood of detecting it in other seasons. Given the evidence of anthropogenic influence on various aspects of the global hydrological cycle that implies that extreme precipitation would be expected to have increased and some limited direct evidence of anthropogenic influence on extreme precipitation, but given also the difficulties in simulating extreme precipitation by climate models and limited observational coverage, we assess, consistent with SREX  that there is medium confidence that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to a global scale intensification of heavy precipitation over the second half of the 20th century in land regions where observational coverage is sufficient for assessment.	0
20th century. This assessment was based on one detection study that identified an anthropogenic fingerprint in a global Palmer Drought Severity Index  data set  and studies of some regions which indicated that droughts in those regions were linked to SST changes or to a circulation response to anthropogenic forcing. SREX  assessed that there was medium confidence that anthropogenic influence has contributed to some changes in the drought patterns observed in the second half of the 20th century based on attributed impact of anthropogenic forcing on precipitation and temperature changes, and that there was low confidence in the assessment of changes in drought at the level of single regions.	0
10.6.1.4 Extratropical Cyclones Drought is a complex phenomenon that is affected by precipitation predominantly, as well as by other climate variables including temperature, wind speed and solar radiation . It is also affected by non-atmospheric conditions such as antecedent soil moisture and land surface conditions. Trends in two important drought-related climate variables  are consistent with the expected responses to anthropogenic forcing over the globe. However, there is large uncertainty in observed changes in drought  and its attribution to causes globally. The evidence for changes in soil moisture indices and drought indices over the period since 1950 globally is conflicting , possibly due to the examination of different time periods, different forcing fields used to drive land surface models and uncertainties in land surface models . In a recent study, Sheffield et al.  identify the representation of potential evaporation as solely dependent on temperature  as a possible explanation for their finding that PDSI-based estimates might overestimate historical drought trends. This stands in partial contradiction to previous assessments suggesting that using a more sophisticated formulation  for potential evaporation did not affect the results of respective PDSI trends . Sheffield et al.  argue that issues with the treatment of spurious trends in atmospheric forcing data sets and/or the choice of calibration periods explain these conflicting results. These conflicting results point out the challenges in quantitatively defining and detecting long-term changes in a multivariable phenomenon such as drought. Recent long-term droughts in western North America cannot definitively be shown to lie outside the very large envelope of natural precipitation variability in this region , particularly given new evidence of the history of high-magnitude natural drought and pluvial episodes suggested by palaeoclimatic reconstructions . Low-frequency tropical ocean temperature anomalies in all ocean basins appear to force circulation changes that promote regional drought . Uniform increases in SST are not particularly effective in this regard . Therefore, the reliable separation of natural variability and forced climate change will require simulations that accurately reproduce changes in largescale SST gradients at all time scales. In summary, assessment of new observational evidence, in conjunction with updated simulations of natural and forced climate varia-	0
AR4 concluded that an anthropogenic influence on extratropical cyclones was not formally detected, owing to large internal variability and problems due to changes in observing systems. Although there is evidence that there has been a poleward shift in the storm tracks , various causal factors have been cited including oceanic heating  and changes in large-scale circulation due to effects of external forcings . Increases in mid-latitude SST gradients generally lead to stronger storm tracks that are shifted poleward and increases in subtropical SST gradients may lead to storm tracks shifting towards the equator . However, changes in storm-track intensity are much more complicated, as they are sensitive to the competing effects of changes in temperature gradients and static stability at different levels and are thus not linked to GMST in a simple way . Overall global average cyclone activity is expected to change little under moderate GHG forcing , although in one study, human influence has been detected in geostrophic wind energy and ocean wave heights derived from sea level pressure data .	0
10.6.1.5 Tropical Cyclones AR4 concluded that `anthropogenic factors more likely than not have contributed to an increase in tropical cyclone intensity' . Evidence that supports this assessment was the strong correlation between the Power Dissipation Index  and tropical Atlantic SSTs  and the association between Atlantic warming and the increase in GMST . Observations suggest an increase globally in the intensities of the strongest tropical cyclones  but it is difficult to attribute such changes to particular causes . The US Climate Change Science Program  discussed human contributions to recent hurricane activity based on a two-step attribution approach. They concluded merely that it is very likely  that human-induced increase in GHGs has contributed to the increase in SSTs in the hurricane formation regions and that over the past 50 years there has been a strong statistical connection between tropical Atlantic SSTs and Atlantic hurricane activity as measured by the PDI. Knutson et al. , assessed that `...it remains uncertain whether past changes in tropical cyclone activity have exceeded the variability expected from natural causes.' Senevi913	0
Studies that directly attribute tropical cyclone activity changes to anthropogenic GHG emission are lacking. Among many factors that may affect tropical cyclone activity, tropical SSTs have increased and this increase has been attributed at least in part to anthropogenic forcing . However, there are diverse views on the connection between tropical cyclone activity and SST . Strong correlation between the PDI and tropical Atlantic SSTs  would suggest an anthropogenic influence on tropical cyclone activity. However, recent studies also suggest that regional potential intensity correlates with the difference between regional SSTs and spatially averaged SSTs in the tropics  and projections are uncertain on whether the relative SST will increase over the 21st century under GHG forcing  . Analyses of CMIP5 simulations suggest that while PDI over the North Atlantic is projected to increase towards late 21st century no detectable change in PDI should be present in the 20th century  . On the other hand, Emanuel et al.  point out that while GCM hindcasts indeed predict little change over the 20th century, downscaling driving by reanalysis data that incorporate historical observations are in much better accord with observations and do indicate a late 20th century increase. Some recent studies suggest that the reduction in the aerosol forcing  over the Atlantic since the 1970s may have contributed to the increase in tropical cyclone activity in the region , and similarly that aerosols may have acted to reduce tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic in earlier years when aerosol forcing was increasing . However, there are different views on the relative contribution of aerosols and decadal natural variability of the climate system to the observed changes in Atlantic tropical cyclone activity among these studies. Some studies indicate that aerosol changes have been the main driver . Other studies infer the influence of natural variability to be as large as or larger than that from aerosols . Globally, there is low confidence in any long-term increases in tropical cyclone activity  and we assess that there is low confidence in attributing global changes to any particular cause. In the North Atlantic region there is medium confidence that a reduction in aerosol forcing over the North Atlantic has contributed at least in part to the observed increase in tropical cyclone activity since the 1970s. There remains substantial disagreement on the relative importance of internal variability, GHG forcing and aerosols for this observed trend. It remains uncertain whether past changes in tropical cyclone activity are outside the range of natural internal variability.	0
Since many of the impacts of climate change are likely to manifest themselves through extreme weather, there is increasing interest in quantifying the role of human and other external influences on climate in specific weather events. This presents particular challenges for both science and the communication of results. It has so far been attempted for a relatively small number of specific events  although Peterson et al.  attempt, for the first time, a coordinated assessment to place different high-impact weather events of the previous year in a climate perspective. In this assessment, selected studies are used to illustrate the essential principles of event attribution: see Stott et al.  for a more exhaustive review. Two distinct ways have emerged of framing the question of how an external climate driver like increased GHG levels may have contributed to an observed weather event. First, the `attributable risk' approach considers the event as a whole, and asks how the external driver may have increased or decreased the probability of occurrence of an event of comparable magnitude. Second, the `attributable magnitude' approach considers how different external factors contributed to the event or, more specifically, how the external driver may have increased the magnitude of an event of comparable occurrence probability. Hoerling et al.  uses both methods to infer changes in magnitude and likelihood of the 2011 Texas heat wave. Quantifying the absolute risk or probability of an extreme weather event in the absence of human influence on climate is particularly challenging. Many of the most extreme events occur because a self-reinforcing process that occurs only under extreme conditions amplifies an initial anomaly . Hence the probability of occurrence of such events cannot, in general, be estimated simply by extrapolating from the distribution of less extreme events that are sampled in the historical record. Proxy records of pre-industrial climate generally do not resolve high-frequency weather, so inferring changes in probabilities requires a combination of hard-to-test distributional assumptions and extreme value theory. Quantifying absolute probabilities with climate models is also difficult because of known biases in their simulation of extreme events. Hence, with only a couple of exceptions , studies have focussed on how risks have changed or how different factors have contributed to an observed event, rather than claiming that the absolute probability of occurrence of that event would have been extremely low in the absence of human influence on climate. Even without considering absolute probabilities, there remain considerable uncertainties in quantifying changes in probabilities. The assessment of such changes will depend on the selected indicator, time period and spatial scale on which the event is analysed, and the way in which the event-attribution question is framed can substantially affect apparent conclusions . If an event occurs in the tail of the distribution, then a small shift in the distribution as a whole can result in a large increase in the probability of an event of a given magnitude: hence it is possible for the same event to be both `mostly natural' in terms of attributable magnitude  and `mostly anthropogenic' in terms of	0

attributable risk . These issues are discussed further using the example of the 2010 Russian heat wave below. The majority of studies have focussed on quantifying attributable risk. Formally, risk is a function of both hazard and vulnerability , although most studies attempting to quantify risk in the context of extreme weather do not explicitly use this definition, which is discussed further in Chapter 19 of WGII, but use the term as a shorthand for the probability of the occurrence of an event of a given magnitude. Any assessment of change in risk depends on an assumption of `all other things being equal', including natural drivers of climate change and vulnerability. Given this assumption, the change in hazard is proportional to the change in risk, so we will follow the published literature and continue to refer to Fraction Attributable Risk, defined as FAR = 1 - P0/P1, P0 being the probability of an event occurring in the absence of human influence on climate, and P1 the corresponding probability in a world in which human influence is included. FAR is thus the fraction of the risk that is attributable to human influence  and does not require knowledge of absolute values of P0 and P1, only their ratio. For individual events with return times greater than the time scale over which the signal of human influence is emerging , it is impossible to observe a change in occurrence frequency directly because of the shortness of the observed record, so attribution is necessarily a multi-step procedure. Either a trend in occurrence frequency of more frequent events is attributed to human influence and a statistical model is then used to extrapolate to the implications for P0 and P1; or an	0
attributable trend is identified in some other variable, such as surface temperature, and a physically based weather model is used to assess the implications for extreme weather risk. Neither approach is free of assumptions: no atmospheric model is perfect, but statistical extrapolation may also be misleading for reasons given above. Pall et al.  provide an example of multi-step assessment of attributable risk using a physically based model, applied to the floods that occurred in the UK in the autumn of 2000, the wettest autumn to have occurred in England and Wales since records began. To assess the contribution of the anthropogenic increase in GHGs to the risk of these floods, a several thousand member ensemble of atmospheric models with realistic atmospheric composition, SST and sea ice boundary conditions imposed was compared with a second ensemble with composition and surface temperatures and sea ice boundary conditions modified to simulate conditions that would have occurred had there been no anthropogenic increase in GHGs since 1900. Simulated daily precipitation from these two ensembles was fed into an empirical rainfall-runoff model and daily England and Wales runoff used as a proxy for flood risk. Results  show that including the influence of anthropogenic greenhouse warming increases flood risk at the threshold relevant to autumn 2000 by around a factor of two in the majority of cases, but with a broad range of uncertainty: in 10% of cases the increase in risk is less than 20%. Kay et al. , analysing the same ensembles but using a more sophisticated hydrological model found a reduction in the risk of snow melt-induced flooding in the spring season  which, aggregated over the entire year, largely compensated for the increased risk of precipitation-induced flooding in autumn. This illustrates an 915	0
important general point: even if a particular flood event may have been made more likely by human influence on climate, there is no certainty that all kinds of flood events in that location, country or region have been made more likely. Rahmstorf and Coumou  provide an example of an empirical approach to the estimation of attributable risk applied to the 2010 Russian heat wave. They fit a nonlinear trend to central Russian temperatures and show that the warming that has occurred in this region since the 1960s has increased the risk of a heat wave of the magnitude observed in 2010 by around a factor of 5, corresponding to an FAR of 0.8. They do not address what has caused the trend since 1960, although they note that other studies have attributed most of the large-scale warming over this period to the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations.	0
Dole et al.  take a different approach to the 2010 Russian heat wave, focussing on attributable magnitude, analysing contributions from various external factors, and conclude that this event was `mainly natural in origin'. First, observations show no evidence of a trend in occurrence frequency of hot Julys in western Russia, and despite the warming that has occurred since the 1960s, mean July temperatures in that region actually display a  cooling trend over the century as a whole, in contrast to the case for central and southern European summer temperatures . Members of the CMIP3 multi-model ensemble likewise show no evidence of a trend towards warming summers in central Russia. Second, Dole et al.  note that the 2010 Russian event was associated with a strong blocking atmospheric flow anomaly, and even the complete 2010 boundary conditions are insufficient to increase the probability of a prolonged blocking event in this region, in contrast again to the situation in Europe in 2003. This anomaly in the large-scale atmospheric flow led to low-pressure systems being redirected around the blocking over Russia causing severe flooding in Pakistan which could so far not be attributed to anthropogenic causes , highlighting that a global perspective is necessary to unravel the different factors influencing individual extreme events . Otto et al.  argue that it is possible to reconcile the results of Rahmstorf and Coumou  with those of Dole et al.  by relating the attributable risk and attributable magnitude approaches to framing the event attribution question. This is illustrated in Figure 10.18c, which shows return times of July temperatures in western Russia in a large ensemble of atmospheric model simulations for the 1960s  and 2000s . The threshold exceeded in 2010 is shown by the solid horizontal line which is almost 6C above 1960s mean July temperatures, shown by the dashed line. The difference between the green and blue lines could be characterized as a 1.5C increase in the magnitude of a 30-year event . Rupp et al.  and Hoerling et al.  reach 916	0
similar conclusions about the 2011 Texas heat wave, both noting the importance of La Nina conditions in the Pacific, with anthropogenic warming making a relatively small contribution to the magnitude of the event, but a more substantial contribution to the risk of temperatures exceeding a high threshold. This shows that the quantification of attributable risks and and changes in magnitude are affected by modelling error  as they depend on the atmospheric model's ability to simulate the observed anomalies in the general circulation . Because much of the magnitude of these two heat waves is attributable to atmospheric flow anomalies, any evidence of a causal link between rising GHGs and the occurrence or persistence of flow anomalies such as blocking would have a very substantial impact on attribution claims. Pall et al.  argue that, although flow anomalies played a substantial role in the autumn 2000 floods in the UK, thermodynamic mechanisms were primarily responsible for the change in risk between their ensembles. Regardless of whether the statistics of flow regimes themselves have changed, observed temperatures in recent years in Europe are distinctly warmer than would be expected for analogous atmospheric flow regimes in the past, affecting both warm and cold extremes . In summary, increasing numbers of studies are finding that the probability of occurrence of events associated with extremely high temperatures has increased substantially due to the large-scale warming since the mid-20th century. Because most of this large-scale warming is very likely due to the increase in atmospheric GHG concentrations, it is possible to attribute, via a multi-step procedure, some of the increase in probability of these regional events to human influence on climate. Such an increase in probability is consistent with the implications of single-step attribution studies looking at the overall implications of increasing mean temperatures for the probabilities of exceeding temperature thresholds in some regions. We conclude that it is likely that human influence has substantially increased the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations. It is expected that attributable risks for extreme precipitation events are generally smaller and more uncertain, consistent with the findings in Kay et al.  and Pall et al. . The science of event attribution is still confined to case studies, often using a single model, and typically focussing on high-impact events for which the issue of human influence has already arisen. While the increasing risk of heat waves measured as the occurrence of a previous temperature record being exceeded can simply be explained by natural variability superimposed by globally increasing temperature, conclusions for holistic events including general circulation patterns are specific to the events that have been considered so far and rely on the representation of relevant processes in the model. Anthropogenic warming remains a relatively small contributor to the overall magnitude of any individual short-term event because its magnitude is small relative to natural random weather variability on short time scales . Because of this random variability, weather events continue to occur that have been made less likely by human influence on climate, such as extreme winter cold events , or whose probability of occurrence has not been significantly affected either way. Quantifying how different external factors contribute to current risks, and how risks are	0
changing, is possible with much higher confidence than quantifying absolute risk. Biases in climate models, uncertainty in the probability distribution of the most extreme events and the ambiguity of paleoclimatic records for short-term events mean that it is not yet possible to quantify the absolute probability of occurrence of any observed weather event in a hypothetical pristine climate. At present, therefore, the evidence does not support the claim that we are observing weather events that would, individually, have been extremely unlikely in the absence of human-induced climate change, although observed trends in the concurrence of large numbers of events  may be more easily attributable to external factors. The most important development since AR4 is an emerging consensus that the role of external drivers of climate change in specific extreme weather events, including events that might have occurred in a pre-industrial climate, can be quantified using a probabilistic approach.	0
Evaluating the causes of climate change before the 20th century is important to test and improve our understanding of the role of internal and forced natural climate variability for the recent past. This section draws on assessment of temperature reconstructions of climate change over the past millennium and their uncertainty in Chapter 5 , and on comparisons of models and data over the pre-instrumental period in Chapters 5 and 9 , and focuses on the evidence for the contribution by radiatively forced climate change to reconstructions and early instrumental records. In addition, the residual variability that is not explained by forcing from palaeoclimatic records provides a useful comparison to estimates of climate model internal variability. The model dependence of estimates of internal variability is an important uncertainty in detection and attribution results. The inputs for detection and attribution studies for periods covered by indirect, or proxy, data are affected by more uncertainty than those from the instrumental period , owing to the sparse data coverage, particularly further back in time, and uncertainty in the link between proxy data and, for example, temperature. Records of past radiative influences on climate are also uncertain . For the preindustrial part of the last millennium changes in solar, volcanic, GHG forcing, and land use change, along with a small orbital forcing are potentially important external drivers of climate change. Estimates of solar forcing  are uncertain, particularly in their amplitude, as well as in modelling, for example, of the influence of solar forcing on atmospheric circulation involving stratospheric dynamics . Estimates of past volcanism are reasonably well established in their timing, but the magnitude of the RF of individual eruptions is uncertain . It is possible that large eruptions had a more moderated climate effect than simulated by many climate models due to faster fallout associated with larger particle size , or increased amounts of injected water vapour . Reconstructed changes in land cover and its effect on climate are also uncertain . Forcing of WMGHGs shows only very subtle variations over the last millennium up to 1750. This includes a small drop and partial recovery	0
in the 17th century , followed by increases in GHG concentrations with industrialization since the middle of the 18th century . When interpreting reconstructions of past climate change with the help of climate models driven with estimates of past forcing, it helps that the uncertainties in reconstructions and forcing are independent from each other. Thus, uncertainties in forcing and reconstructions combined should lead to less, rather than more similarity between fingerprints of forced climate change and reconstructions, making it improbable that the response to external drivers is spuriously detected. However, this is the case only if all relevant forcings and their uncertainties are considered, reducing the risk of misattribution due to spurious correlations between external forcings, and if the data are homogeneous and statistical tests properly applied . Hence this section focuses on work that considers all relevant forcings simultaneously.	0
10.7.1.1 Role of External Forcing in the Last Millennium The AR4 concluded that `A substantial fraction of the reconstructed NH inter-decadal temperature variability of the seven centuries prior to 1950 is very likely attributable to natural external forcing'. The literature since the AR4, and the availability of more simulations of the last millennium with more complete forcing , including solar, volcanic and GHG influences, and generally also land use change and orbital forcing) and more sophisticated models, to a much larger extent coupled climate or coupled ESMs , some of them with interactive carbon cycle, strengthens these conclusions. Most reconstructions show correlations with external forcing that are similar to those found between pre-Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 3  simulations of the last millennium and forcing, suggesting an influence by external forcing . From a global scale average of new regional reconstructions, Past Global Changes 2k  Consortium  find that periods with strong volcanic and solar forcing combined occurring over the last millennium show significantly cooler conditions than randomly selected periods from the last two millennia. Detection analyses based on PMIP3 and CMIP5 model simulations for the years from 850 to 1950 and also from 850 to 1850 find that the fingerprint of external forcing is detectable in all reconstructions of NH mean temperature considered , but only in about half the cases considered does detection also occur prior to 1400. The authors find a smaller response to forcing in reconstructions than simulated, but this discrepancy is consistent with 917	0
uncertainties in forcing or proxy response to it, particularly associated with volcanism. The discrepancy is reduced when using more strongly smoothed data or omitting major volcanic eruptions from the analysis. The level of agreement between fingerprints from multiple models in response to forcing and reconstructions decreases earlier in time, and the forced signal is detected only in about half the cases considered when analysing the period 851 to 1401. This may be partly due to weaker forcing and larger forcing uncertainty early in the millennium and partly due to increased uncertainty in reconstructions. Detection results indicate a contribution by external drivers to the warm conditions in the 11th to 12th century, but cannot explain the warmth around the 10th century in some of the reconstructions . This detection of a role of external forcing extends work reported in AR4 back into to the 9th century CE.	0
Detection and attribution studies support results from modelling studies that infer a strong role of external forcing in the cooling of NH temperatures during the Little Ice Age . Both model simulations  and results from detection and attribution studies  suggest that a small drop in GHG concentrations may have contributed to the cool conditions during the 16th and 17th centuries. Note, however, that centennial variations of GHG during the late Holocene are very small relative to their increases since pre-industrial times . The role of solar forcing is less clear except for decreased agreement if using very large solar forcing . Palastanga et al.  demonstrate that neither a slowdown of the thermohaline circulation nor a persistently negative NAO alone can explain the reconstructed temperature pattern over Europe during the periods 1675-1715 and 1790-1820.	0
Figure 10.19 | The top panel compares the mean annual Northern Hemisphere  surface air temperature from a multi-model ensemble to several NH temperature reconstructions. These reconstructions are: CH-blend from Hegerl et al.  in purple, which is a reconstruction of 30N to 90N land only , plotted for the region 30N to 90N land and sea  and D'Arrigo et al.  in red, which is a reconstruction of 20N to 90N land only. The dotted coloured lines show the corresponding instrumental data. The multi-model mean for the reconstructed domain is scaled to fit each reconstruction in turn, using a total least squares  method. The best estimate of the detected forced signal is shown in orange  with light orange shading indicating the range expected if accounting for internal variability. The best fit scaling values for each reconstruction are given in the insert as well as the detection results for six other reconstructions ; AW ; Mo ; Ju ; CH ; CL  and inverse regressed onto the instrumental record CS; DA ; Fr . An asterisk next to the reconstruction name indicates that the residuals  are inconsistent with the internal variability generated by the combined control simulations of all climate models investigated . The ensemble average of a data-assimilation simulation  is plotted in blue, for the region 30N to 90N land and sea, with the error range shown in light blue shading. The bottom panel is similar to the top panel, but showing the European region, following Hegerl et al.  but using the simulations and method in Schurer et al. . The detection analysis is performed for the period 1500-1950 for two reconstructions: Luterbacher et al.  shown in red, and Mann et al.  , shown in green. As in the top panel, best fit estimates are shown in dark orange with uncertainty range due to internal variability shown in light orange. The data assimilation from Goosse et al. , constrained by the Mann et al.  reconstruction is shown in blue, with error range in light blue. All data are shown with respect to the mean of the period covered by the white part of the figure .	0
Data assimilation studies support the conclusion that external forcing, together with internal climate variability, provides a consistent explanation of climate change over the last millennium. Goosse et al.  select, from a very large ensemble with an EMIC, the individual simulations that are closest to the spatial reconstructions of temperature between 30N and 60N by Mann et al.  accounting for reconstruction uncertainties. The method also varies the external forcing within uncertainties, determining a combined realization of the forced response and internal variability that best matches the data. Results  show that simulations reproduce the target reconstruction within the uncertainty range, increasing confidence in the consistency of the reconstruction and the forcing. The results suggest that long-term circulation anomalies may help to explain the hemispheric warmth early in the millennium, although results vary dependent on input parameters of the method.	0
10.7.1.2 Role of Individual Forcings Volcanic forcing shows a detectable influence on large-scale temperature , and volcanic forcing plays an important role in explaining past cool episodes, for example, in the late 17th and early 19th centuries  . Schurer et al.  separately detect the response to GHG variations between 1400 and 1900 in most NH reconstructions considered, and that of solar and volcanic forcing combined in all reconstructions considered. Even the multi-century perspective makes it difficult to distinguish century-scale variations in NH temperature due to solar forcing alone from the response to other forcings, due to the few degrees of freedom constraining this forcing . Hegerl et al.  found solar forcing detectable in some cases. Simulations with higher than best guess solar forcing may reproduce the warm period around 1000 more closely, but the peak warming occurs about a century earlier in reconstructions than in solar forcing and with it model simulations . Even if solar forcing were on the high end of estimates for the last millennium, it would not be able to explain the recent warming according both to model simulations  and detection and attribution approaches that scale the temporal fingerprint of solar forcing to best match the data . Some studies suggest that particularly for millennial and multi-millenial time scales orbital forcing may be important globally  and for high-latitude trends  based on a comparison of the correspondence between long-term Arctic cooling in models and data though the last millennium up to about 1750 .	0
estimate of internal variability for NH mean temperature that is not directly derived from climate model simulation. This residual variability is somewhat larger than control simulation variability for some reconstructions if the comparison is extended to the full period since 850 CE , However, when extracting 50- and 60-year trends from this residual variability, the distribution of these trends is similar to the multi-model control simulation ensemble used in Schurer et al. . In all cases considered, the most recent 50-and 60-year trend from instrumental data is far outside the range of any 50-year trend in residuals from reconstructions of NH mean temperature of the past millennium.	0
Several reconstructions of European regional temperature variability are available . While Bengtsson et al.  emphasized the role of internal variability in pre-industrial European climate as reconstructed by Luterbacher et al. , Hegerl et al.  find a detectable response to external forcing in summer temperatures in the period 1500-1900, for winter temperatures during 1500-1950 and 1500-2000; and throughout the record for spring. The fingerprint of the forced response shows coherent time evolution between models and reconstructed temperatures over the entire analysed period . This suggests that the cold European winter conditions in the late 17th and early 19th century and the warming in between were at least partly externally driven. Data assimilation results focussing on the European sector suggests that the explanation of forced response combined with internal variability is self-consistent . The assimilated simulations reproduce the warmth of the MCA better than the forced only simulations do. The response to individual forcings is difficult to distinguish from each other in noisier regional reconstructions. An epoch analysis of years immediately following strong, largely tropical, volcanic eruptions shows that European summers show detectable fingerprints of volcanic response , while winters show a noisy response of warming in northern Europe and cooling in southern Europe . Landrum et al.  suggest similar volcanic responses for North America, with warming in the north of the continent and cooling in the south. There is also evidence for a decrease in SSTs following tropical volcanic forcing in tropical reconstructions over the past 450 years . There is also substantial literature suggesting solar influences on regional climate reconstructions, possibly due to circulation changes, for example, changes in Northern Annular Modes .	0
that the combination of internal variability and external forcing provides a consistent explanation of the last millennium and suggest that changes in circulation may have further contributed to climate anomalies. The role of external forcing extends to regional records, for example, European seasonal temperatures. In summary, it is very unlikely that NH temperature variations from 1400 to 1850 can be explained by internal variability alone. There is medium confidence that external forcing contributed to NH temperature variability from 850 to 1400. There is medium confidence that external forcing  contributed to European temperatures of the last five centuries.	0
Detection and Attribution results can be used to constrain predictions of future climate change  and key climate system properties. These properties include: the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity , which determines the long-term equilibrium warming response to stable atmospheric composition, but not accounting for vegetation or ice sheet changes ; the transient climate response , which is a measure of the magnitude of transient warming while the climate system, particularly the deep ocean, is not in equilibrium; and the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions , which is a measure of the transient warming response to a given mass of CO2 injected into the atmosphere, and combines information on both the carbon cycle and climate response. TCR is more tightly constrained by the observations of transient warming than ECS. The observational constraints on TCR, ECS and TCRE assessed here focus on information provided by recent observed climate change, complementing analysis of feedbacks and climate modelling information, which are assessed in Chapter 9. The assessment in this chapter also incorporates observational constraints based on palaeoclimatic information, building on Chapter 5, and contributes to the overall synthesis assessment in Chapter 12 . Because neither ECS nor TCR is directly observed, any inference about them requires some form of climate model, ranging in complexity from a simple zero-dimensional energy balance box model to OAGCMs . Constraints on estimates of long-term climate change and equilibrium climate change from recent warming hinge on the rate at which the ocean has taken up heat , and by the extent to which recent warming has been reduced by cooling from aerosol forcing. Therefore, attempts to estimate climate sensitivity  often also estimate the total aerosol forcing and the rate of ocean heat uptake, which are discussed in Section 10.8.3. The AR4 contained a detailed discussion on estimating quantities relevant for projections, and included an appendix with the relevant estimation methods. Here, we build on this assessment, repeating information and discussion only where necessary to provide context.	0
after 70 years) in a 1% yr-1 increasing CO2 experiment , but like ECS, it can also be thought of as a generic property of the climate system that determines the global temperature response T to any gradual increase in RF, F, taking place over an approximately 70-year time scale, normalized by the ratio of the forcing change to the forcing due to doubling CO2, F2xCO2: TCR = F2xCO2 T/F . This generic definition of the TCR has also been called the `Transient Climate Sensitivity' . TCR is related to ECS and the global energy budget as follows: ECS = F2xCO2/, where  is the sensitivity parameter representing the net increase in energy flux to space per degree of warming given all feedbacks operating on these time scales. Hence, by conservation of energy, ECS = F2xCO2 T/, where Q is the change in the rate of increase of climate system heat content in response to the forcing F. On these time scales, deep ocean heat exchange affects the surface temperature response as if it were an enhanced radiative damping, introducing a slow, or `recalcitrant', component of the response which would not be reversed for many decades even if it were possible to return RF to pre-industrial values : hence the difficulty of placing an upper bound on ECS from observed surface warming alone . Because Q is always positive at the end of a period of increasing forcing, before the climate system has re-equilibrated, TCR is always less than ECS, and since Q is uncertain, TCR is generally better constrained by observations of recent climate change than ECS. Because TCR focuses on the short- and medium-term response, constraining TCR with observations is a key step in narrowing estimates of future global temperature change in the relatively short term and under scenarios where forcing continues to increase or peaks and declines . After stabilization, the ECS eventually becomes the relevant climate system property. Based on observational constraints alone, the AR4 concluded that TCR is very likely to be larger than 1C and very unlikely to be greater than 3.5C . This supported the overall assessment that the transient climate response is very unlikely greater than 3C and very likely greater than 1C . New estimates of the TCR are now available. Scaling factors derived from detection and attribution studies  express how model responses to GHGs and aerosols need to be scaled to match the observations over the historical period. These scaled responses were used in AR4 to provide probabilistic projections of both TCR and future changes in global temperature in response to these forcings under various scenarios . Allen et al. , Frame et al.  and Kettleborough et al.  demonstrate a near linear relationship between 20th century warming, TCR and warming by the mid-21st century as parameters are varied in Energy Balance Models, justifying this approach. Forster et al.  show how the ratio T/ F does depend on the forcing history, with very rapid increases in forcing giving lower values: hence any inference from past attributable warming to future warming or TCR depends on a model  to relate these quantities. Such inferences also depend on forcing estimates and projections. Recent revisions to RF  suggest higher net anthropogenic forcing over the 20th century, and hence a smaller estimated	0
TCR. Stott et al.  demonstrated that optimal detection analysis of 20th century temperature changes  are able to exclude the very high and low temperature responses to aerosol forcing. Consequently, projected 21st century warming may be more closely constrained than if the full range of aerosol forcings is used . Stott and Forest  demonstrate that projections obtained from such an approach are similar to those obtained by constraining EMIC parameters from observations. Stott et al. , using HadGEM2-ES, and Gillett et al. , using CanESM2, both show that the inclusion of observations between 2000 and 2010 in such an analysis reduces the uncertainties in projected warming in the 21st century, and tends to constrain the maximum projected warming to below that projected using data to 2000 only . Such an improvement is consistent with prior expectations of how additional data will narrow uncertainties . TCR estimates have been derived using a variety of methods . Knutti and Tomassini  compare EMIC simulations with 20th century surface and ocean temperatures to derive a probability density function for TCR skewed slightly towards lower values with a 5 to 95% range of 1.1C to 2.3C. Libardoni and Forest  take a similar approach with a different EMIC and include atmospheric data and, under a variety of assumptions, obtain 5 to 95% ranges for TCR spanning 0.9C to 2.4C. Updating this study to include data to 2004 gives results that are essentially unchanged. Using a single model and observations from 1851 to 2010 Gillett et al.  derive a 5 to 95% range of 1.3C to 1.8C and using a single model, but using multiple sets of observations and analysis periods ending in 2010 and beginning in 1910 or earlier, Stott et al.  derive 5 to 95% ranges that were generally between 1C and 3C. Both Stott et al.  and Gillett et al.  find that the inclusion of data between 2000 and 2010 helps to constrain the upper bound of TCR. Gillett et al.  find that the inclusion of data prior to 1900 also helps to constrain TCR, though Stott et al.  do not. Gillett et al.  account for a broader range of model and observational uncertainties, in particular addressing the efficacy of non-CO2 gases, and find a range of 0.9C to 2.3C. Several of the estimates of TCR that were cited by Hegerl et al.  may have underestimated non-CO2 efficacies relative to the more recent estimates in Forster et al. . Because observationally constrained estimates of TCR are based on the ratio between past attributable warming and past forcing, this could account for a high bias in some of the inputs used for the AR4 TCR estimate. Held et al.  show that a two-box model originally proposed by Gregory , distinguishing the `fast' and `recalcitrant' responses, fits both historical simulations and instantaneous doubled CO2 simulations of the GFDL coupled model CM2.1. The fast response has a relaxation time of 3 to 5 years, and the historical simulation is almost completely described by this fast component of warming. Padilla et al.  use this simple model to derive an observationally constrained estimate of the TCR of 1.3C to 2.6C. Schwartz  uses this twotime scale formulation to obtain TCR estimates ranging from 0.9C to 1.9C, the lower values arising from higher estimates of forcing over the 20th century. Otto et al.  update the analysis of Gregory et al.  and Gregory and Forster  using forcing estimates from Forster et al.  to obtain a 5 to 95% range for TCR of 0.9C to 2.0C comparing the decade 2000-2009 with the period 1860-1879.	0
They note, however, the danger of overinterpreting a single, possibly anomalous, decade, and report a larger TCR range of 0.7C to 2.5C replacing the 2000s with the 40 years 1970-2009. Tung et al.  examine the response to the 11-year solar cycle using discriminant analysis, and find a high range for TCR: >2.5C to 3.6C However, this estimate may be affected by different mechanisms by which solar forcing affects climate . The authors attempt to minimize possible aliasing with the response to other forcings in the 20th century and with internal climate variability, although some influence by them cannot be ruled out. Rogelj et al.  take a somewhat different approach, using a simple climate model to match the distribution of TCR to observational constraints and a consensus distribution of ECS , following Meinshausen et al. . Harris et al.  estimate a distribution for TCR based on a large sample of emulated GCM equilibrium responses, constrained by multiannual mean observations of recent climate and adjusted to account for additional uncertainty associated with model structural deficiencies . The equilibrium responses are scaled by global temperature changes associated with the sampled model variants, reweighting the projections based on the likelihood that they correctly replicate observed historical changes in surface temperature, to predict the TCR distribution. Both of these studies represent a combination of multiple lines of evidence, although still strongly informed by recent observed climate change, and hence are assessed here for completeness. Based on this evidence, including the new 21st century observations that were not yet available to AR4, we conclude that, on the basis of constraints provided by recent observed climate change, TCR is likely to lie in the range 1C to 2.5C and extremely unlikely to be greater than 3C. This range for TCR is smaller than given at the time of AR4, due to the stronger observational constraints and the wider range of studies now available. Our greater confidence in excluding high values of TCR arises primarily from higher and more confident estimates of past forcing: estimates of TCR are not strongly dependent on observations of ocean heat uptake.	0
The equilibrium climate sensitivity  is defined as the warming in response to a sustained doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere relative to pre-industrial levels . The equilibrium to which the ECS refers to is generally assumed to be an equilibrium involving the ocean-atmosphere system, which does not include Earth system feedbacks such as long-term melting of ice sheets and ice caps, dust forcing or vegetation changes . The ECS cannot be directly deduced from transient warming attributable to GHGs, or from TCR, as the role of ocean heat uptake has to be taken into account . Estimating the ECS generally relies on the paradigm of a comparison of observed change with results from a physically based climate model, sometimes a very simple one, given uncertainty in the model, data, RF and due to internal variability. 921	0
As discussed in the AR4, the probabilistic estimates available in the literature for climate system parameters, such as ECS and TCR have all been based, implicitly or explicitly, on adopting a Bayesian approach and therefore, even if it is not explicitly stated, involve using some kind of prior information. The shape of the prior has been derived from expert judgement in some studies, observational or experimental evidence in others or from the distribution of the sample of models available. In all cases the constraint by data, for example, from transient warming, or observations related to feedbacks is fairly weak on the upper tail of ECS . Therefore, results are sensitive to the prior assumptions . When the prior distribution fails to taper off for high sensitivities, as is the case for uniform priors , this leads to long tails . Uniform priors have been criticized  since results assuming a uniform prior in ECS translates instead into a strongly structured prior on climate feedback parameter and vice versa . Objective Bayesian analyses attempt to avoid this paradox by using a prior distribution that is invariant to parameter transforms and rescaling, for example, a Jeffreys prior . Estimated probability densities based on priors that are strongly non-uniform in the vicinity of the best fit to the data, as is typically the case for the Jeffreys prior in this instance, can peak at values very different from the location of the best fit, and hence need to be interpreted carefully. To what extent results are sensitive to priors can be evaluated by using different priors, and this has been done more consistently in studies than at the time of AR4  and is assessed where available, illustrated in Figure 10.20. Results will also be sensitive to the extent to which uncertainties in forcing , models and observations and internal climate variability are taken into account, and can be acutely sensitive to relatively arbitrary choices of observation period, choice of truncation in estimated covariance matrices and so forth , illustrating the importance of sensitivity studies. Analyses that make a more complete effort to estimate all uncertainties affecting the model-data comparison lead to more trustworthy results, but end up with larger uncertainties . The detection and attribution chapter in AR4  concluded that `Estimates based on observational constraints indicate that it is very likely that the equilibrium climate sensitivity is larger than 1.5C with a most likely value between 2C and 3C'. The following sections discuss evidence since AR4 from several lines of evidence, followed by an overall assessment of ECS based on observed climate changes, and a subset of available new estimates is shown in Figure 10.20b. 922	0
10.8.2.1 Estimates from Recent Temperature Change As estimates of ECS based on recent temperature change can only sample atmospheric feedbacks that occur with presently evolving climate change, they provide information on the `effective climate sensitivity' . As discussed in AR4, analyses based on global scale data find that within data uncertainties, a strong aerosol forcing or a large ocean heat uptake might have masked a strong greenhouse warming . This is consistent with the finding that a set of models with a large range of ECS and aerosol forcing could be consistent with the observed warming . Consequently, such analyses find that constraints on aerosol forcing are essential to provide tighter constraints on future warming . Aldrin et al.  analyse the observed record from 1850 to 2007 for hemispheric means of surface temperature, and upper 700 m ocean heat content since 1955. The authors use a simple climate model and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian technique for analysis. The authors find a quite narrow range of ECS, which narrows further if using a uniform prior in 1/ECS rather than ECS . If observations are updated to 2010 and forcing estimates including further indirect aerosol effects are used , this yields a reduced upper tail . However, this estimate involves a rather simple model for internal variability, hence may underestimate uncertainties. Olson et al.  use similar global scale constraints and surface temperature to 2006, and ocean data to 2003 and arrive at a wide range if using a uniform prior in ECS, and a quite well constrained range if using a prior derived from current mean climate and Last Glacial Maximum  constraints . Some of the differences between Olson et al.  and Aldrin et al.  may be due to structural differences in the model used , some due to different statistical methods and some due to use of global rather than hemispheric temperatures in the latter work. An approach based on regressing forcing histories used in 20th century simulations on observed surface temperatures  estimates ranges of ECS that encompass the AR4 ranges if accounting for data uncertainty . Otto et al.  updated the Gregory et al.  global energy balance analysis , using temperature and ocean heat content data to 2009 and estimates of RF that are approximately consistent with estimates from Chapters 7 and 8, and ocean heat uptake estimates that are consistent with Chapter 3 and find that inclusion of recent deep ocean heat uptake and temperature data considerably narrow estimates of ECS compared to results using data to the less recent past. Estimates of ECS and TCR that make use of both spatial and temporal information, or separate the GHG attributable warming using fingerprint methods, can yield tighter estimates . The resulting GHG attributable warming tends to be reasonably robust to uncertainties in aerosol forcing . Forest et al.  have updated their earlier study using a newer version of the MIT model and five different surface temperature data sets . Correction of statistical errors in estimation procedure pointed out by Lewis  changes their result only slightly (Libardoni	0
and Forest, 2013). The overarching 5 to 95% range of effective climate sensitivity widens to 1.2C to 5.3C when all five data sets are used, and constraints on effective ocean diffusivity become very weak . Uncertainties would likely further increase if estimates of forcing uncertainty, for example, due to natural forcings, are also included . Lewis  reanalysed the data used in Forest et al.  using an objective Bayesian method . The author finds that use of a Jeffreys prior narrows the upper tail considerably, to 3.6C for the 95th percentile. When revising the method, omitting upper air data, and adding 6 more years of data a much reduced 5 to 95% range of 1.2C to 2.2C results , similar to estimates by Ring et al.  using data to 2008. Lewis's upper limit extends to 3.0C if accounting for forcing and surface temperature uncertainty . Lewis  also reports a range of 1.1C to 2.9C using his revised diagnostics and the Forest et al.  statistical method, whereas adding 9 more years to the Libardoni and Forest  corrected diagnostic , does not change results much . The differences between results reported in Forest et al. ; Libardoni and Forest ; Lewis ; Libardoni and Forest  are still not fully understood, but appear to be due to a combination of sensitivity of results to the choice of analysis period as well as differences in diagnostics and statistical approach. In summary, analyses that use the most recent decade find a tightening of the range of ECS based on a combination of recent heat uptake and surface temperature data. Results consistently give low probability to ECS values under 1.0C . The mode of the PDFs varies considerably with period considered as expected from the influence of internal variability on the single realization of observed climate change. Estimates including the most recent data tend to have reduced upper tails , although further uncertainty in statistical assumptions and structural uncertainties in simple models used, as well as neglected uncertainties, for example, in forcings, increase assessed uncertainty.	0
10.8.2.2 Estimates Based on Top of the Atmosphere Radiative Balance With the satellite era, measurements are now long enough to allow direct estimates of variations in the energy budget of the planet, although the measurements are not sufficiently accurate to determine absolute top of the atmosphere  fluxes or trends . Using a simple energy balance relationship between net energy flow towards the Earth, net forcing and a climate feedback parameter and the satellite measurements Murphy et al.  made direct estimates of the climate feedback parameter as the regression coefficient of radiative response against GMST. The feedback parameter in turn is inversely proportional to the ECS . Such regression based estimates are, however, subject to uncertainties . Lindzen and Choi  used data from the radiative budget and simple energy balance models over the tropics to investigate feedbacks in climate models. Their result suggests that climate models overestimate the outgoing shortwave	0
r adiation compared to Earth Radiation Budget Experiment  data, but this result was found unreliable owing to use of a limited sample of periods and of a domain limited to low latitudes . Lindzen and Choi  address some of these criticisms , but the results remains uncertain. For example, the lag-lead relationship between TOA balance and SST  is replicated by Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project  simulations where SST cannot respond . Hence, as discussed in Section 7.2.5.7, the influence of internal temperature variations on short time scales seriously affects such estimates of feedbacks. In addition, the energy budget changes that are used to derive feedbacks are also affected by RF, which Lindzen and Choi  do not account for. Murphy and Forster  further question if estimates of the feedback parameter are suitable to estimate the ECS, as multiple time scales are involved in feedbacks that contribute to climate sensitivity . Lin et al.  use data over the 20th century combined with an estimate of present TOA imbalance based on modelling  to estimate the energy budget of the planet and give a best estimate of ECS of 3.1C, but do not attempt to estimate a distribution that accounts fully for uncertainties. In conclusion, measurement and methodological uncertainties in estimates of the feedback parameter and the ECS from short-term variations in the satellite period preclude strong constraints on ECS. When accounting for these uncertainties, estimates of ECS based on the TOA radiation budget appear consistent with those from other lines of evidence within large uncertainties .	0
10.8.2.3 Estimates Based on Response to Volcanic Forcing or Internal Variability Some analyses used in AR4 were based on the well observed forcing and responses to major volcanic eruptions during the 20th century. The constraint is fairly weak because the peak response to short-term volcanic forcing depends nonlinearly on ECS . Recently, Bender et al.  re-evaluated the constraint and found a close relationship in 9 out of 10 AR4 models between the shortwave TOA imbalance, the simulated response to the eruption of Mt Pinatubo and the ECS. Applying the constraint from observations suggests a range of ECS of 1.7C to 4.1C. This range for ECS is subject to observational uncertainty and uncertainty due to internal climate variability, and is derived from a limited sample of models. Schwartz  tried to relate the ECS to the strength of natural variability using the fluctuation dissipation theorem but studies suggest that the observations are too short to support a well constrained and reliable estimate and would yield an underestimate of sensitivity ; and that assuming single time scales is too simplistic for the climate system  . Thus, credible estimates of ECS from the response to natural and internal variability do not disagree with other estimates, but at present cannot provide more reliable estimates of ECS.	0
on forcing and temperature changes. For periods of past climate, which were close to radiative balance or when climate was changing slowly, for example, the LGM, radiative imbalance and with it ocean heat uptake is less important than for the present . Treating the RF due to ice sheets, dust and CO2 as forcings rather than feedbacks implies that the corresponding RF contributions are associated with considerable uncertainties . Koehler et al.  used an estimate of LGM cooling along with its uncertainties together with estimates of LGM RF and its uncertainty to derive an overall estimate of climate sensitivity. This method accounts for the effect of changes in feedbacks for this very different climatic state using published estimates of changes in feedback factors . The authors find a best estimate of 2.4C and a 5 to 95% range of ECS from 1.4C to 5.2C, with sensitivities beyond 6C difficult to reconcile with the data. In contrast, Chylek and Lohmann  estimate the ECS to be 1.3C to 2.3C based on data for the transition from the LGM to the Holocene. However, the true uncertainties are likely larger due to uncertainties in relating local proxies to large-scale temperature change observed over a limited time . The authors also use an aerosol RF estimate that may be high . At the time of the AR4, several studies were assessed in which parameters in climate models had been perturbed systematically in order to estimate ECS, and further studies have been published since, some making use of expanded data for LGM climate change . Sometimes substantial differences between estimates based on similar data reflect not only differences in assumptions on forcing and use of data, but also structural model uncertainties, for example, in how feedbacks change between different climatic states . Holden et al.  analysed which versions of the EMIC Genie are consistent with LGM tropical SSTs and find a 90% range of 2.0C to 5.0C. Recently, new data synthesis products have become available for assessment with climate model simulations of the LGM which together with further data cover much more of the LGM ocean and land areas, although there are still substantial gaps and substantial data uncertainty . An analysis of the recent SST and land temperature reconstructions for the LGM compared to simulations with an EMIC suggests a 90% range of 1.4C to 2.8C for ECS, with SST data providing a narrower range and lower values than land data only . However, structural model uncertainty as well as data uncertainty may increase this range substantially . Hargreaves et al.  derived a relationship between ECS and LGM response for seven model simulations from PMIP2 simulations and found a linear relationship between tropical cooling and ECS  which has been used to derive an estimate of ECS ; and has been updated using PMIP3 simulations . However, uncertainties remain as the relationship is dependent on the ensemble of models used. Estimates of ECS from other, more distant paleoclimate periods  are difficult to directly compare, as climatic conditions were very 924	0
d ifferent from today and as climate sensitivity can be state dependent, as discussed above. Also, the response on very long time scales is determined by the Earth System Sensitivity, which includes very slow feedbacks by ice sheets and vegetation . Paleosens Members  reanalysed the relationship between RF and temperature response from paleoclimatic studies, considering Earth system feedbacks as forcings in order to derive an estimate of ECS that is limited to atmospheric feecbacks , and find that resulting estimates are reasonably consistent over the past 65 million years . They estimate a 95% range of 1.1C to 7.0C, largely based on the past 800,000 years. However, uncertainties in paleoclimate estimates of ECS are likely to be larger than from the instrumental record, for example, due to changes in feedbacks between different climatic states. In conclusion, estimates of ECS have continued to emerge from palaeoclimatic periods that indicate that ECS is very likely less than 6C and very likely greater than 1.0C .	0
10.8.2.5 Combining Evidence and Overall Assessment Most studies find a lower 5% limit for ECS between 1C and 2C . The combined evidence thus indicates that the net feedbacks to RF are significantly positive. At present, there is no credible individual line of evidence that yields very high or very low climate sensitivity as best estimate. Some recent studies suggest a low climate sensitivity . However, these are based on problematic assumptions, for example, about the climate's response time, the cause of climate fluctuations, or neglect uncertainty in forcing, observations and internal variability . In some cases the estimates of the ECS have been refuted by testing the method of estimation with a climate model of known sensitivity . Several authors  had proposed combining estimates of climate sensitivity from different lines of evidence by the time of AR4; these and recent work is shown in the panel `combined' in Figure 10.20. Aldrin et al.  combined the Hegerl et al.  estimate based on the last millennium with their estimate based on the 20th century; and Olson et al.  combined weak constraints from climatology and the LGM in their prior, updated by data on temperature changes. This approach is robust only if the lines of evidence used are truly independent. The latter is hard to evaluate when using prior distributions based on expert knowledge . If lines of evidence are not independent, overly confident assessments of equilibrium climate sensitivity may result . In conclusion, estimates of the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity  based on multiple and partly independent lines of evidence from observed climate change, including estimates using longer records of surface temperature change and new palaeoclimatic evidence, indicate that there is high confidence that ECS is extremely unlikely less than 1C and medium confidence that the ECS is likely between 1.5C and 4.5C and very unlikely greater than 6C. They complement the	0

Ranges that are assessed as being incomplete are marked by arrows; note that in contrast to the other estimates Schwartz , shows a sampling range and Chylek and Lohmann a 95% range. Estimates are based on changes over the instrumental period ; and changes from palaeoclimatic data . Studies that combine multiple lines of evidence are shown in the bottom panel. The boxes on the right-hand side indicate limitations and strengths of each line of evidence, for example, if a period has a similar climatic base state, if feedbacks are similar to those operating under CO2 doubling, if the observed change is close to equilibrium, if, between all lines of evidence plotted, uncertainty is accounted for relatively completely, and summarizes the level of scientific understanding of this line of evidence overall. A blue box indicates an overall line of evidence that is well understood, has small uncertainty, or many studies and overall high confidence. Pale yellow indicates medium, and dark red low, confidence . Where available, results are shown using several different prior distributions; for example for Aldrin et al.  solid shows the result using a uniform prior in ECS, which is shown as updated to 2010 in dash-dots; dashed: uniform prior in 1/ECS; and in bottom panel, result combining with Hegerl et al.  prior, For Lewis , dashed shows results using the Forest et al.  diagnostic and an objective Bayesian prior, solid a revised diagnostic. For Otto et al. , solid is an estimate using change to 1979-2009, dashed using the change to 2000-2009. Palaeoclimate: Hargreaves et al.  is shown in solid, with dashed showing an update based on PMIP3 simulations ; For Schmittner et al. , solid is land-and-ocean, dashed land-only, and dash-dotted is ocean-only diagnostic.	0
Some estimates of ECS also yield estimates of aerosol forcing that are consistent with observational records, which we briefly mention here. Note that the estimate will reflect any forcings with a time or time- space pattern resembling aerosol forcing that is not explicitly included in the overall estimate , for example, BC on snow; and should hence be interpreted as an estimate of aerosol plus neglected forcings. Estimates will also vary with the method applied and diagnostics used . Murphy et al.  use correlations between surface temperature and outgoing shortwave and longwave flux over the satellite period to estimate how much of the total recent forcing has been reduced by aerosol total reflection, which they estimate as -1.1  0.4 W m-2 from 1970 to 2000 , while Libardoni and Forest , see also Forest et al. , based on the 20th century, find somewhat lower estimates, namely a 90% bound of -0.83 to -0.19 W m-2 for the 1980s relative to preindustrial. Lewis , using similar diagnostics but an objective Bayesian method, estimates a total aerosol forcing of about -0.6 to -0.1W m-2 or -0.6 to 0.0 W m-2 dependent on diagnostic used. The range of the aerosol forcing estimates that are based on the observed climate change are in-line with the expert judgement of the effective RF by aerosol radiation and aerosol cloud interactions combined  of -0.9 W m-2 with a range from -1.9 to -0.1 W m-2 that has been guided by climate models that include aerosol effects on mixed-phase and convective clouds in addition to liquid clouds, satellite studies and models that allow cloud-scale responses . Several estimates of ECS also estimate a parameter that describe the efficiency with which the ocean takes up heat, e.g., effective global vertical ocean diffusivity . Forest and Reynolds  find that the effective global ocean diffusivity Kv in many of the CMIP3 models lies above the median value based on observational constraints, resulting in a positive bias in their ocean heat uptake. Lewis  similarly finds better agreement for small values of effective ocean diffusivity. However, such a finding was very sensitive to data sets used for surface temperature  and ocean data , is somewhat sensitive to the diagnostic applied , and limited by difficulties observing heat uptake in the deep ocean . Olson et al.  and Tomassini et al.  find that data over the historical period provide only a weak constraint on background ocean effective diffusivity. Comparison of the vertical profiles of temperature and of historical warming in models and observations suggests that the ocean heat uptake efficiency may be typically too large . If effective diffusivity were high in models this might lead to a tendency to bias ocean warming high relative to surface warming; but this uncertainty makes 926	0
A number of papers have found the global warming response to CO2 emissions to be determined primarily by total cumulative emissions of CO2, irrespective of the timing of those emissions over a broad range of scenarios , although Bowerman et al.  find that, when scenarios with persistent `emission floors' are included, the strongest predictor of peak warming is cumulative emissions to 2200. Moreover, the ratio of global warming to cumulative carbon emissions, known variously as the Absolute Global Temperature Change Potential  , the Cumulative Warming Commitment   or the Carbon Climate Response  , is approximately scenario-independent and constant in time. The ratio of CO2-induced warming realized by a given year to cumulative carbon emissions to that year is known as the Transient Climate Response to cumulative CO2 Emissions . TCRE depends on TCR and the Cumulative Airborne Fraction , which is the ratio of the increased mass of CO2 in the atmosphere to cumulative CO2 emissions  over a long period, typically since pre-industrial times : TCRE = TCR x CAF/C0, where C0 is the mass of carbon  in the pre-industrial atmosphere . Given estimates of CAF to the time of CO2 doubling of 0.4 to 0.7 , we therefore expect values of TCRE, if expressed in units of C per 1000 PgC, to be similar to or slightly lower than, and more uncertain than, values of TCR . TCRE may be estimated from observations by dividing an estimate of warming to date attributable to CO2 by historical cumulative carbon emissions, which gives a 5 to 95% range of 0.7C to 2.0C per 1000 PgC , 1.0C to 2.1C per 1000 PgC  or 1.4C to 2.5C per 1000 PgC , the higher range in the latter study reflecting a higher estimate of CO2-attributable warming to 2000. The peak warming induced by a given total cumulative carbon emission ) is less well constrained, since warming may continue even after a complete cessation of CO2 emissions, particularly in high-response models or scenarios. Using a combination of observations and models to constrain temperature and carbon cycle parameters in a simple climate-carbon-cycle model, , obtain a PRCE 5 to 95% confidence interval of 1.3C to 3.9C per 1000 PgC. They also report that  obtain a 5 to 95% range in PRCE of 1.1C to 2.7C per 1000 PgC using a Bayesian approach with a different simple model, with climate parameters constrained	0
The evidence has grown since the Fourth Assessment Report that widespread changes observed in the climate system since the 1950s are attributable to anthropogenic influences. This evidence is documented in the preceding sections of this chapter, including for near surface temperatures , free atmosphere temperatures , atmospheric moisture content , precipitation over land , ocean heat content , ocean salinity , sea level , Arctic sea ice , climate extremes  and evidence from the last millenium . These results strengthen the conclusion that human influence on climate has played the dominant role in observed warming since the 1950s. However, the approach taken so far in this chapter has been to examine each aspect of the climate system--the atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere, extremes, and from paleoclimate archives--separately in each section and sub-section. In this section we look across the whole climate system to assess the extent that a consistent picture emerges across sub-systems and climate variables.	0
Multi-variable studies provide one approach to gain a more comprehensive view across the climate system, although there have been relatively few applications of multi-variable detection and attribution studies in the literature. A combined analysis of near-surface temperature from weather stations and free atmosphere temperatures from radiosondes detected an anthropogenic influence on the joint changes in temperatures near the surface and aloft . In a Bayesian application of detection and attribution Schnur and Hasselmann  combined surface temperature, diurnal temperature range and precipitation into a single analysis and showed strong net evidence for detection of anthropogenic forcings despite low likelihood ratios for diurnal temperature range and precipitation on their own. Barnett et al.  applied a multi-variable approach in analysing changes in the hydrology of the Western United States . The potential for a multi-variable analysis to have greater power to discriminate between forced changes and internal variability has been demonstrated by Stott and Jones  and Pierce et al. . In the former case, they showed that a multi-variable fingerprint consisting of the responses of GMST and sub-tropical Atlantic salinity has a higher S/N ratio than the fingerprints of each variable separately. They found reduced detection times as a result of low correlations between the two variables in the control simulation although the detection result	0
depends on the ability of the models to represent the co-variability of the variables concerned. Multi-variable attribution studies potentially provide a stronger test of climate models than single variable attribution studies although there can be sensitivity to weighting of different components of the multi-variable fingerprint. In an analysis of ocean variables, Pierce et al.  found that the joint analysis of temperature and salinity changes yielded a stronger signal of climate change than `either salinity or temperature alone'. Further insights can be gained by considering a synthesis of evidence across the climate system. This is the subject of the next subsection.	0
To demonstrate how observed changes across the climate system can be understood in terms of natural and anthropogenic causes Figure 10.21 compares observed and modelled changes in the atmosphere, ocean and cryosphere. The instrumental records associated with each element of the climate system are generally independent , and consequently joint interpretations across observations from the main components of the climate system increases the confidence to higher levels than from any single study or component of the climate system. The ability of climate models to replicate observed changes  across a wide suite of climate indicators also builds confidence in the capacity of the models to simulate the Earth's climate. The coherence of observed changes for the variables shown in Figure 10.21 with climate model simulations that include anthropogenic and natural forcing is remarkable. Surface temperatures over land, SSTs and ocean heat content changes show emerging anthropogenic and natural signals with a clear separation between the observed changes and the alternative hypothesis of just natural variations . These signals appear not just in the global means, but also at continental and ocean basin scales in these variables. Sea ice emerges strongly from the range expected from natural variability for the Arctic and Antarctica remains broadly within the range of natural variability consistent with expectations from model simulations including anthropogenic forcings. Table 10.1 illustrates a larger suite of detection and attribution results across the climate system than summarized in Figure 10.21. These results include observations from both the instrumental record and paleo-reconstructions on a range of time scales ranging from daily extreme precipitation events to variability over millennium time scales. From up in the stratosphere, down through the troposphere to the surface of the Earth and into the depths of the oceans there are detectable signals of change such that the assessed likelihood of a detectable, and often quantifiable, human contribution ranges from likely to extremely likely for many climate variables . Indeed to successfully describe the observed warming trends in the atmosphere, ocean and at the surface over the past 50 years, contributions from both anthropogenic and natural forcings are required . This is consistent with anthropogenic forcings warming the surface of the Earth, troposphere and oceans superimposed with cooling events caused by the three large explosive volcanic eruptions since the 1960's. These two effects (anthropogenic warming and vol927	0
FAQ 10.2 | When Will Human Influences on Climate Become Obvious on Local Scales? Human-caused warming is already becoming locally obvious on land in some tropical regions, especially during the warm part of the year. Warming should become obvious in middle latitudes--during summer at first--within the next several decades. The trend is expected to emerge more slowly there, especially during winter, because natural climate variability increases with distance from the equator and during the cold season. Temperature trends already detected in many regions have been attributed to human influence. Temperature-sensitive climate variables, such as Arctic sea ice, also show detected trends attributable to human influence. Warming trends associated with global change are generally more evident in averages of global temperature than in time series of local temperature . This is because most of the local variability of local climate is averaged away in the global mean. Multi-decadal warming trends detected in many regions are considered to be outside the range of trends one might expect from natural internal variability of the climate system, but such trends will only become obvious when the local mean climate emerges from the `noise' of year-to-year variability. How quickly this happens depends on both the rate of the warming trend and the amount of local variability. Future warming trends cannot be predicted precisely, especially at local scales, so estimates of the future time of emergence of a warming trend cannot be made with precision. In some tropical regions, the warming trend has already emerged from local variability . This happens more quickly in the tropics because there is less temperature variability there than in other parts of the globe. Projected warming may not emerge in middle latitudes until the mid-21st century--even though warming trends there are larger--because local temperature variability is substantially greater there than in the tropics. On a seasonal basis, local temperature variability tends to be smaller in summer than in winter. Warming therefore tends to emerge first in the warm part of the year, even in regions where the warming trend is larger in winter, such as in central Eurasia in FAQ 10.2, Figure 1.	0
Variables other than land surface temperature, including some oceanic regions, also show rates of long-term change different from natural variability. For example, Arctic sea ice extent is declining very rapidly, and already shows a human influence. On the other hand, local precipitation trends are very hard to detect because at most locations the variability in precipitation is quite large. The probability of record-setting warm summer temperatures has increased throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere . High temperatures presently considered extreme are projected to become closer to the norm over the coming decades. The probabilities of other extreme events, including some cold spells, have lessened. In the present climate, individual extreme weather events cannot be unambiguously ascribed to climate change, since such events could have happened in an unchanged climate. However the probability of occurrence of such events could have changed significantly at a particular location. Human-induced increases in greenhouse gases are estimated to have contributed substantially to the probability of some heatwaves. Similarly, climate model studies suggest that increased greenhouse gases have contributed to the observed intensification of heavy precipitation events found over parts of the Northern Hemisphere. However, the probability of many other extreme weather events may not have changed substantially. Therefore, it is incorrect to ascribe every new weather record to climate change. The date of future emergence of projected warming trends also depends on local climate variability, which can temporarily increase or decrease temperatures. Furthermore, the projected local temperature curves shown in FAQ 10.2, Figure 1 are based on multiple climate model simulations forced by the same assumed future emissions scenario. A different rate of atmospheric greenhouse gas accumulation would cause a different warming trend, so the spread of model warming projections  would be wider if the figure included a spread of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The increase required for summer temperature change to emerge from 20th century local variability  is depicted on the central map in FAQ 10.2, Figure 1. A full answer to the question of when human influence on local climate will become obvious depends on the strength of evidence one considers sufficient to render something `obvious'. The most convincing scientific evidence for the effect of climate change on local scales comes from analysing the global picture, and from the wealth of evidence from across the climate system linking many observed changes to human influence. 	0
FAQ 10.2, Figure 1 | Time series of projected temperature change shown at four representative locations for summer  and winter . Each time series is surrounded by an envelope of projected changes  yielded by 24 different model simulations, emerging from a grey envelope of natural local variability simulated by the models using early 20th century conditions. The warming signal emerges first in the tropics during summer. The central map shows the global temperature increase  needed for temperatures in summer at individual locations to emerge from the envelope of early 20th century variability. Note that warm colours denote the smallest needed temperature increase, hence earliest time of emergence. All calculations are based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  global climate model simulations forced by the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5  emissions scenario. Envelopes of projected change and natural variability are defined as 2 standard deviations. 	0

canic eruptions) cause much of the observed response . Both natural and anthropogenic forcings are required to understand fully the variability of the Earth system during the past 50 years. Water in the free atmosphere is expected to increase, as a consequence of warming of the atmosphere , and atmospheric circulation controls the global distribution of precipitation and evaporation. Simulations show that GHGs increase moisture in the atmosphere and change its transport in such a way as to produce patterns of precipitation and evaporation that are quite distinct from the observed patterns of warming. Our assessment shows that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to observed increases in moisture content in the atmosphere , to global scale changes in precipitation patterns over land , to a global scale intensification of heavy precipitation in land regions where there observational coverage is sufficient to make an assessment , and to changes in surface and sub-surface ocean salinity . Combining evidence from both atmosphere and ocean that systematic changes in precipitation over land and ocean salinity can be attributed to human influence supports an assessment that it is likely that human influence has affected the global water cycle since 1960. Warming of the atmosphere and the oceans affects the cryosphere, and in the case of snow and sea ice warming leads to positive feedbacks that amplify the warming response in the atmosphere and oceans. Retreat of mountain glaciers has been observed with an anthropogenic influence detected , Greenland ice sheet has melted at the edges and accumulating snow at the higher elevations is consistent with GHG warming supporting an assessment for an anthropogenic influence on the negative surface mass balance of Greenland's ice sheet . Our level of scientific understanding is too low to provide a quantifiable explanation of the observed mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheet . Sea ice in the Arctic is decreasing rapidly and the changes now exceed internal variability and with an anthropogenic contribution detected . Antarctic sea ice extent has grown overall over the last 30 years but there is low scientific understanding of the spatial variability and changes in Antarctic sea ice extent . There is evidence for an anthropogenic component to observed reductions in NH snow cover since the 1970s .	0
that human influence has substantially increased the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations . An analysis of these results  shows that there is high confidence in attributing many aspects of changes in the climate system to human influence including from atmospheric measurements of temperature. Synthesizing the results in Table 10.1 shows that the combined evidence from across the climate system increases the level of confidence in the attribution of observed climate change to human influence and reduces the uncertainties associated with assessments based on a single variable. From this combined evidence, it is virtually certain that human influence has warmed the global climate system.	0
Anthropogenic forcing has also affected temperature on continental scales, with human influences having made a substantial contribution to warming in each of the inhabited continents , and having contributed to the very substantial Arctic warming over the past 50 years  while because of large observational uncertainties there is low confidence in attribution of warming averaged over available stations over Antarctica . There is also evidence that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to temperature change in many sub-continental regions  and that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century . Furthermore there is evidence 931	0
Observational uncertainties in radiosondes are now much better documented than at time of AR4. It is virtually certain that the troposphere has warmed since the mid-20th century but there is only medium confidence in the rate and vertical structure of those changes in the NH extratropical troposphere and low confidence elsewhere. Most, though not all, CMIP3 and CMIP5 models overestimate the observed warming trend in the tropical troposphere during the satellite period although observational uncertainties are large and outside the tropics and over the period of the radiosonde record beginning in 1961 there is better agreement between simulated and observed trends.  New generation of stratosphere resolving models appear to have adequate representation of lower stratospheric variability. Structure of stratospheric temperature trends and variations is reasonably well represented by models. CMIP5 models all include changes in stratospheric ozone while only about half of the models participating in CMIP3 include stratospheric ozone changes. 	0

Detectable anthropogenic influence on changes in sea level pressure patterns is found in several attribution studies that sample observational and modelling uncertainty. Observational uncertainties not fully sampled as results based largely on variants of one gridded data set although analyses based on reanalyses also support the finding of a detectable anthropogenic influence.  Consistent result of modelling studies is that the main aspect of the anthropogenically forced response on the DJF SAM is the impact of ozone depletion. The observational record is relatively short, observational uncertainties remain, and the DJF SAM trend since 1951 is only marginally inconsistent with internal variability in some data sets. 	0

Decadal Prediction The nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system imposes natural limits on the extent to which skilful predictions of climate statistics may be made. Model-based `predictability' studies, which probe these limits and investigate the physical mechanisms involved, support the potential for the skilful prediction of annual to decadal average temperature and, to a lesser extent precipitation. Predictions for averages of temperature, over large regions of the planet and for the global mean, exhibit positive skill when verified against observations for forecast periods up to ten years . Predictions of precipitation over some land areas also exhibit positive skill. Decadal prediction is a new endeavour in climate science. The level of quality for climate predictions of annual to decadal average quantities is assessed from the past performance of initialized predictions and non-initialized simulations. 	0
Projected Changes in Air Quality The range in projections of air quality  is driven primarily by emissions , rather than by physical climate change . The response of air quality to climate-driven changes is more uncertain than the response to emission-driven changes . Globally, warming decreases background surface O3 . High CH4 levels  can offset this decrease, raising 2100 background surface O3 on average by about 8 ppb  relative to scenarios with small CH4 changes  . On a continental scale, projected air pollution levels are lower under the new RCP scenarios than under the SRES scenarios because the SRES did not incorporate air quality legislation . 	0
This chapter describes current scientific expectations for `near-term' climate. Here `near term' refers to the period from the present to mid-century, during which the climate response to different emissions scenarios is generally similar. Greatest emphasis in this chapter is given to the period 2016-2035, though some information on projected changes before and after this period  is also assessed. An assessment of the scientific literature relating to atmospheric composition , which is addressed in Chapter 12) and air quality for the near-term and beyond to 2100 is also provided. This emphasis on near-term climate arises from  a recognition of its importance to decision makers in government and industry;  an increase in the international research effort aimed at improving our understanding of near-term climate; and  a recognition that nearterm projections are generally less sensitive to differences between future emissions scenarios than are long-term projections. Climate prediction on seasonal to multi-annual time scales require accurate estimates of the initial climate state with less dependence on changes in external forcing3 over the period. On longer time scales climate projections rely on projections of external forcing with little reliance on the initial state of internal variability. Estimates of near-term climate depend partly on the committed change , the time evolution of internally generated climate variability and the future path of external forcing. Near-term climate is sensitive to rapid changes in some short-lived climate forcing agents .	0
The need for near-term climate information has spawned a new field of climate science: decadal climate prediction . The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  experimental protocol includes a sequence of nearterm predictions  where observation-based information is used to initialize the models used to produce the forecasts. The goal is to exploit the predictability of internally generated climate variability as well as that of the externally forced component. The result depends on the ability of current models to reproduce the observed variability as well as on the accurate depiction of the initial state . Skilful multi-annual to decadal climate predictions  are being produced although technical challenges remain that need to be overcome in order to improve skill. These challenges are now being addressed by the scientific community. Climate change experiments with models that do not depend on initial condition but on the history and projection of climate forcings  are another component of CMIP5. Such projections have been the main focus of assessments of future climate in previous IPCC assessments and are considered in Chapters 12 to 14. The main focus of attention in past assessments has been on the properties of projections for the late 21st century and beyond. Projections also	0
p rovide valuable information on externally forced changes to nearterm climate, however, and are an important source of information that complements information from the predictions. Projections are also assessed in this chapter. The objectives of this chapter are to assess the state of the science concerning both near-term predictions and near-term projections. CMIP5 results are considered for the near term as are other published nearterm predictions and projections. The chapter consists of four major assessments: 1. The scientific basis for near-term prediction as reflected in estimates of predictability , and the dynamical and physical mechanisms underpinning predictability, and the processes that limit predictability . 2. The current state of knowledge in near-term prediction . Here the emphasis is placed on the results from the decadal  multi-model prediction experiments in the CMIP5 database. 3. The current state of knowledge in near-term projection . Here the emphasis is on what the climate in next few decades may look like relative to 1986-2005, based on near-term projections . The focus is on the `core' near-term period , but some information prior to this period and out to mid-century is also discussed. A key issue is when, where and how the signal of externally forced climate change is expected to emerge from the background of natural climate variability. 4. Projected changes in atmospheric composition and air quality, and their interactions with climate change during the near term and beyond, including new findings from the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison  initiative.	0
Box 11.1 | Climate Simulation, Projection, Predictability and Prediction This section outlines some of the ideas and the terminology used in this chapter. Internally generated and externally forced climate variability It is useful for purposes of analysis and description to consider the pre-industrial climate system as being in a state of climatic equilibrium with a fixed atmospheric composition and an unchanging Sun. In this idealized state, naturally occurring processes and interactions within the climate system give rise to `internally generated' climate variability on many time scales . Variations in climate may also result due to features `external' to this idealized system. Forcing factors, such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations, anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere, land use change etc., give rise to `externally forced' climate variations. In this sense climate system variables such as annual mean temperatures  may be characterized as a combination of externally forced and internally generated components with T = Tf + Ti. This separation of T, and other climate variables, into components is useful when analysing climate behaviour but does not, of course, mean that the climate system is linear or that externally forced and internally generated components do not interact. Climate simulation A climate simulation is a model-based representation of the temporal behaviour of the climate system under specified external forcing and boundary conditions. The result is the modelled response to the imposed external forcing combined with internally generated variability. The thin yellow lines in Box 11.1, Figure 1 represent an ensemble of climate simulations begun from pre-industrial conditions with imposed historical external forcing. The imposed external conditions are the same for each ensemble member and differences among the simulations reflect differences in the evolutions of the internally generated component. Simulations are not intended to be forecasts of the observed evolution of the system  but to be possible evolutions that are consistent with the external forcings. In practice, and in Box 11.1, Figure 1, the forced component of the temperature variation is estimated by averaging over the different simulations of T with Tf the component that survives ensemble averaging  while Ti averages to near zero for a large enough ensemble. The spread among individual ensemble members  and their behaviour with time provides some information on the statistics of the internally generated variability. 	0
Box 11.1, Figure 1 | The evolution of observation-based global mean temperature T  as the difference from the 1986-2005 average together with an ensemble of externally forced simulations to 2005 and projections based on the RCP4.5 scenario thereafter . The model-based estimate of the externally forced component Tf  is the average over the ensemble of simulations. To the extent that the red line correctly estimates the forced component, the difference between the black and red lines is the internally generated component Ti for global mean temperature. An ensemble of forecasts of global annual mean temperature, initialized in 1998, is plotted as thin purple lines and their average, the ensemble mean forecast, as the thick green line. The grey areas along the axis indicate the presence of external forcing associated with volcanoes.	0
Climate projection A climate projection is a climate simulation that extends into the future based on a scenario of future external forcing. The simulations in Box 11.1, Figure 1 become climate projections for the period beyond 2005 where the results are based on the RCP4.5 forcing scenario . Climate prediction, climate forecast A climate prediction or climate forecast is a statement about the future evolution of some aspect of the climate system encompassing both forced and internally generated components. Climate predictions do not attempt to forecast the actual day-to-day progression of the system but instead the evolution of some climate statistic such as seasonal, annual or decadal averages or extremes, which may be for a particular location, or a regional or global average. Climate predictions are often made with models that are the same as, or similar to, those used to produce climate simulations and projections . A climate prediction typically proceeds by integrating the governing equations forward in time from observation-based initial conditions. A decadal climate prediction combines aspects of both a forced and an initial condition problem as illustrated in Box 11.1, Figure 2. At short time scales the evolution is largely dominated by the initial state while at longer time scales the influence of the initial conditions decreases and the importance of the forcing increases as illustrated in Box 11.1, Figure 4. Climate predictions may also be made using statistical methods which relate current to future conditions using statistical relationships derived from past system behaviour. Because of the chaotic and nonlinear nature of the climate system small differences, in initial conditions or in the formulation of the forecast model, result in different evolutions of forecasts with time. This is illustrated in Box 11.1, Figure 1, which displays an ensemble of forecasts of global annual mean temperature  initiated in 1998. The individual forecasts are begun from slightly different initial conditions, which are observation-based estimates of the state of the climate system. The thick green line is the average of these forecasts and is an attempt to predict the most probable outcome and to maximize forecast skill. In this schematic example, the 1998 initial conditions for the forecasts are warmer than the average of the simulations. The individual and ensemble mean forecasts exhibit a decline in global temperature before beginning to rise again. In this case, initialization has resulted in more realistic values for the forecasts than for the corresponding simulation, at least for short lead times in the forecast. As the individual forecasts evolve they diverge from one another and begin to resemble the projection results. A probabilistic view of forecast behaviour is depicted schematically in Box 11.1, Figure 3. The probability distribution associated with the climate simulation of temperature evolves in response to external forcing. By contrast, the probability distribution associated with a climate forecast has a sharply peaked initial distribution representing the comparatively small uncertainty in the observation-based initial state. The forecast probability distribution broadens with time until, ultimately, it becomes indistinguishable from that of an uninitialized climate projection.	0
probability distribution  are indications of the system's predictability. If initially close states separate rapidly , the predictability of the system is low and vice versa. Formally, predictability in climate science is a feature of the physical system itself, rather than of our `ability to make skilful predictions in practice'. The latter depends on the accuracy of models and initial conditions and on the correctness with which the external forcing can be treated over the forecast period. Forecast quality, forecast skill Forecast  quality measures the success of a prediction against observation-based information. Forecasts made for past cases, termed retrospective forecasts or hindcasts, may be analysed to give an indication of the quality that may be expected for future forecasts for a particular variable at a particular location.	0

The global average of the correlation skill score of ensemble mean initialized forecasts are plotted as solid orange lines and the corresponding model-based predictability measure as dashed orange lines. The green lines are the same quantities but for uninitialized climate simulations. Results are for temperature averaged over periods from a month to a decade. Values plotted for the monthly average correspond to the first month, those for the annual average to the first year and so on up to the decadal average. 	0
Prognostic predictability studies analyse the behaviour of models integrated forward in time from perturbed initial conditions. The study of Griffies and Bryan  is one of the earliest studies of the predictability of internally generated decadal variability in a coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model. The study concentrates on the North Atlantic and the subsurface ocean temperature while the subsequent studies of Boer  and Collins  deal mainly with surface temperature. Long time scale temperature variability in the North Atlantic has received considerable attention together with its p ossible connection to the variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation  in predictability studies by Collins and Sinha , Collins et al. , Dunstone and Smith , Dunstone et al. , Grotzner et al. , Hawkins and Sutton , Latif et al. , )Msadek et al. , Persechino et al. , Pohlmann et al. , Swingedouw et al. , and Teng et al. . The predictability of the AMOC varies among models and, to some extent, with initial model states, ranging from several to 10 or more years. The predictability values are model-based and the realism of the simulated AMOC in the models cannot be easily judged in the absence of a sufficiently long record of observation-based AMOC values. Many predictability studies are based on perturbations to surface quantities but Sevellec and A. Fedorov  and Zanna  note that small perturbations to deep ocean quantities may also affect upper ocean values. The predictability of the North Atlantic sea surface temperature  is typically weaker than that of the AMOC and the connection between the predictability of the AMOC, and the SST is inconsistent among models. Prognostic predictability studies of the Pacific are less plentiful although Pacific Decadal Variability  mechanisms  and the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation  have received considerable study . Power and Colman  find predictability on multi-year time scales in SST and on decadal time-scales in the sub-surface ocean temperature in the off-equatorial South Pacific in their model. Power et al.  find no evidence for the predictability of inter-decadal changes in the nature of El Nino-Southern Oscillation  impacts on Australian rainfall. Sun and Wang  suggest that some of the temperature variability linked to PDV can be predicted approximately 7 years in advance. Teng et al.  investigate the predictability of the first two Empirical Orthogonal Functions  of annual mean SST and upper ocean temperature identified with PDV and find predictability of the order of 6 to 10 years. Meehl et al.  consider the 962	0
p redictability of 19-year filtered Pacific SSTs in terms of low order EOFs and find predictability on these long time scales. Hermanson and Sutton  report that predictable signals in different regions and for different variables may arise from differing initial conditions and that ocean heat content is more predictable than atmospheric and surface variables. Branstator and Teng  analyse upper ocean temperatures, and some SSTs, for averages over the North Atlantic, North Pacific and the tropical Atlantic and Pacific in the National Center for Atmospheric Research  model. Predictability associated with the initial state of the system decreases whereas that due to external forcing increases with time. The `cross-over' time, when the two contributions are equal, is longer in extratropical  compared to tropical  regions and in the North Atlantic compared to the North Pacific. Boer et al.  estimate surface air  temperature predictability in the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis  model and find a cross-over time  on the order of 3 years when averaged over the globe.	0
11.2.1.3 Diagnostic Predictability Studies Diagnostic predictability studies are based on analyses of the observed record or the output of climate models. Because long data records are needed, diagnostic multi-annual to decadal predictability studies based on observational data are comparatively few. Newman  and Alexander et al.  develop multivariate empirical Linear Inverse Models  from observation-based SSTs and find predictability for ENSO and PDV type patterns that are generally limited to the order of a year although exceeding this in some areas. Zanna  develops a LIM based on Atlantic SSTs and infers the possibility of decadal scale predictability. Hoerling et al.  appeal to forced climate change relative to the 1971-2000 period together with the statistics of natural variability to infer the potential for the prediction of temperature over North America for 2011-2020. Tziperman et al.  apply LIM-based methods to Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory  model output, as do Hawkins and Sutton  and Hawkins et al.  to Hadley Centre model output and find predictability up to a decade or more for the AMOC and North Atlantic SST. Branstator et al.  use analog and multivariate linear regression methods to quantify the predictability of the internally generated component of upper ocean temperature in results from six coupled models. Results differ considerably across models but offer some areas of commonality. Basin-average estimates indicate predictability for up to a decade in the North Atlantic and somewhat less in the North Pacific. Branstator and Teng  assess the predictability of both the internally generated and forced component of upper ocean temperature in results from 12 coupled models participating in CMIP5. They infer potential predictability from initializing the internally generated component for 5 years in the North Pacific and 9 years in the North Atlantic while the forced component dominates after 6.5 and 8 years in the two basins. Results vary among models, although with some agreement for internal component predictability in subpolar gyre regions. Studies of `potential predictability' take a number of forms but broadly assume that overall variability may be separated into a long time	0
scale component of interest and shorter time scale components that are unpredictable on these long time scales, written symbolically as s2X = s2v + s2e. The fraction p = s2v / s2X is a measure of potentially predictable variance provided that hypothesis that s2v is zero may be rejected. Small p indicates either a lack of long time scale variability or its smallness as a fraction of the total. Predictability is `potential' in the sense that the existence of appreciable long time scale variability is not a direct indication that it may be skilfully predicted. There are	0
FAQ 11.1 | If You Cannot Predict the Weather Next Month, How Can You Predict Climate for the Coming Decade? Although weather and climate are intertwined, they are in fact different things. Weather is defined as the state of the atmosphere at a given time and place, and can change from hour to hour and day to day. Climate, on the other hand, generally refers to the statistics of weather conditions over a decade or more. An ability to predict future climate without the need to accurately predict weather is more commonplace that it might first seem. For example, at the end of spring, it can be accurately predicted that the average air temperature over the coming summer in Melbourne  will very likely be higher than the average temperature during the most recent spring--even though the day-to-day weather during the coming summer cannot be predicted with accuracy beyond a week or so. This simple example illustrates that factors exist--in this case the seasonal cycle in solar radiation reaching the Southern Hemisphere--that can underpin skill in predicting changes in climate over a coming period that does not depend on accuracy in predicting weather over the same period. The statistics of weather conditions used to define climate include long-term averages of air temperature and rainfall, as well as statistics of their variability, such as the standard deviation of year-to-year rainfall variability from the long-term average, or the frequency of days below 5C. Averages of climate variables over long periods of time are called climatological averages. They can apply to individual months, seasons or the year as a whole. A climate prediction will address questions like: `How likely will it be that the average temperature during the coming summer will be higher than the long-term average of past summers?' or: `How likely will it be that the next decade will be warmer than past decades?' More specifically, a climate prediction might provide an answer to the question: `What is the probability that temperature  averaged over the next ten years will exceed the temperature in China averaged over the past 30 years?' Climate predictions do not provide forecasts of the detailed day-to-day evolution of future weather. Instead, they provide probabilities of long-term changes to the statistics of future climatic variables. Weather forecasts, on the other hand, provide predictions of day-to-day weather for specific times in the future. They help to address questions like: `Will it rain tomorrow?' Sometimes, weather forecasts are given in terms of probabilities. For example, the weather forecast might state that: `the likelihood of rainfall in Apia tomorrow is 75%'.	0
To make accurate weather predictions, forecasters need highly detailed information about the current state of the atmosphere. The chaotic nature of the atmosphere means that even the tiniest error in the depiction of `initial conditions' typically leads to inaccurate forecasts beyond a week or so. This is the so-called `butterfly effect'. Climate scientists do not attempt or claim to predict the detailed future evolution of the weather over coming seasons, years or decades. There is, on the other hand, a sound scientific basis for supposing that aspects of climate can be predicted, albeit imprecisely, despite the butterfly effect. For example, increases in long-lived atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations tend to increase surface temperature in future decades. Thus, information from the past can and does help predict future climate. Some types of naturally occurring so-called `internal' variability can--in theory at least--extend the capacity to predict future climate. Internal climatic variability arises from natural instabilities in the climate system. If such variability includes or causes extensive, long-lived, upper ocean temperature anomalies, this will drive changes in the overlying atmosphere, both locally and remotely. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon is probably the most famous example of this kind of internal variability. Variability linked to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation unfolds in a partially predictable fashion. The butterfly effect is present, but it takes longer to strongly influence some of the variability linked to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Meteorological services and other agencies have exploited this. They have developed seasonal-to-interannual prediction systems that enable them to routinely predict seasonal climate anomalies with demonstrable predictive skill. The skill varies markedly from place to place and variable to variable. Skill tends to diminish the further the prediction delves into the future and in some locations there is no skill at all. `Skill' is used here in its technical sense: it is a measure of how much greater the accuracy of a prediction is, compared with the accuracy of some typically simple prediction method like assuming that recent anomalies will persist during the period being predicted. Weather, seasonal-to-interannual and decadal prediction systems are similar in many ways 	0
predictions, and they are all subject to limits on forecast accuracy imposed by the butterfly effect). However, decadal prediction, unlike weather and seasonal-to-interannual prediction, is still in its infancy. Decadal prediction systems nevertheless exhibit a degree of skill in hindcasting near-surface temperature over much of the globe out to at least nine years. A `hindcast' is a prediction of a past event in which only observations prior to the event are fed into the prediction system used to make the prediction. The bulk of this skill is thought to arise from external forcing. `External forcing' is a term used by climate scientists to refer to a forcing agent outside the climate system causing a change in the climate system. This includes increases in the concentration of long-lived greenhouse gases. Theory indicates that skill in predicting decadal precipitation should be less than the skill in predicting decadal surface temperature, and hindcast performance is consistent with this expectation. Current research is aimed at improving decadal prediction systems, and increasing the understanding of the reasons for any apparent skill. Ascertaining the degree to which the extra information from internal variability actually translates to increased skill is a key issue. While prediction systems are expected to improve over coming decades, the chaotic nature of the climate system and the resulting butterfly effect will always impose unavoidable limits on predictive skill. Other sources of uncertainty exist. For example, as volcanic eruptions can influence climate but their timing and magnitude cannot be predicted, future eruptions provide one of a number of other sources of uncertainty. Additionally, the shortness of the period with enough oceanic data to initialize and assess decadal predictions presents a major challenge. Finally, note that decadal prediction systems are designed to exploit both externally forced and internally generated sources of predictability. Climate scientists distinguish between decadal predictions and decadal projections. Projections exploit only the predictive capacity arising from external forcing. While previous IPCC Assessment Reports focussed exclusively on projections, this report also assesses decadal prediction research and its scientific basis.	0
for both externally forced and internally generated components of the potential predictability of decadal means of surface air temperature in simulations of 21st century climate in CMIP3 model data are analysed in Boer  and results based on CMIP5 model data are shown in Figure 11.2. Potential predictability of 5-year means for internally generated variability is found over extratropical oceans but is generally weak over land while that associated with the decadal change in the forced component is found in tropical areas and over some land areas. Predictability studies of precipitation on long time scales are comparatively few. Jai and DelSole  identify `optimally predictable' fractions of internally generated temperature and precipitation variance over land on multi-year time scales in the control simulations of 10 models participating in CMIP5, with results that vary considerably from model to model. Boer and Lambert  find little potential predictability for decadal means of precipitation in the internally generated variability of a collection of CMIP3 model control simulations other than over parts of the North Atlantic. This is also the case for the internally generated component of CMIP3 precipitation in 21st century climate change simulations in Boer  although there is evidence of potential predictability for the forced component of precipitation mainly at higher latitudes and for longer time scales.	0
a few years to a decade, than is available from uninitialized climate simulations alone. Predictability results are, however, based mainly on climate model results and depend on the verisimilitude with which the models reproduce climate system behaviour . There is evidence of multi-year predictability for both the internally generated and externally forced components of temperature over considerable portions of the globe with the first dominating at shorter and the second at longer time scales. Predictability for precipitation is based on fewer studies, is more modest than for temperature, and appears to be associated mainly with the forced component at longer time scales. Predictability can also vary from location to location.	0
11.2.2.1 Initial Conditions A dynamical prediction consists of an ensemble of forecasts produced by integrating a climate model forward in time from a set of observation-based initial conditions. As the forecast range increases, processes in the ocean become increasingly important and the sparseness, non-uniformity and secular change in sub-surface ocean observations is a challenge to analysis and prediction  and can lead to differences among ocean analyses, that is, quantified descriptions of ocean initial conditions . Approaches to ocean initialization include : assimilation only of SSTs to initialize the sub-surface ocean indirectly (Keenlyside et al., 2008; 965	0
Dunstone, 2010; Swingedouw et al., 2013); the forcing of the ocean model with atmospheric observations  and more sophisticated alternatives based on fully coupled data assimilation schemes . Dunstone and Smith  and Zhang et al.  found an expected improvement in skill when sub-surface information was used as part of the initialization. Assimilation of atmospheric data, on the other hand, is expected to have little impact after the first few months . The initialization of sea ice, snow cover, frozen soil and soil moisture can potentially contribute to seasonal and subseasonal skill , although an assessment of their benefit at longer time scales has not yet been determined.	0
An ensemble can be generated in many different ways and a wide range of methods have been explored in seasonal prediction  but not yet fully investigated for decadal prediction . Methods being investigated include adding random perturbations to initial conditions, using atmospheric states displaced in time, using parallel assimilation runs  and perturbing ocean initial conditions . Perturbations leading to rapidly growing modes, common in weather forecasting, have also been investigated . The uncertainty associated with the limitations of a model's representation of the climate system may be partially represented by perturbed physics  or stochastic physics , and applied to multi-annual and decadal predictions . Weisheimer et al.  compare these three approaches in a seasonal prediction context. The multi-model approach, which is used widely and most commonly, combines ensembles of predictions from a collection of models, thereby increasing the sampling of both initial conditions and model properties. Multi-model approaches are used across time scales ranging from seasonal-interannual , to seasonal-decadal , in climate change simulation  and in the ENSEMBLES and CMIP5-based decadal predictions assessed in Section 11.2.3. A problem with the multi-model approach is tha inter-dependence of the climate models used in current forecast systems  is expected to lead to co-dependence of forecast error.	0
and Miller, 2001). Both global and regional predictions of surface temperature have been made based on projected changes in external forcing and the observed state of the natural variability at the start date . Some of these forecast systems are also used as benchmarks to compare with the dynamical systems under development. Comparisons  have shown that there is similarity in the temperature skill between a linear inverse method and the CMIP5 hindcasts, pointing at a similarity in their sources of skill. In the future, the combination of information from empirical and dynamical predictions might be explored to provide a unified and more skilful source of information. Evidence for skilful interannual to decadal temperatures using dynamical models forced only by previous and projected changes in anthropogenic greenhouse gases  and aerosols and natural variations in volcanic aerosols and solar irradiance is reported by Lee et al. , Raisanen and Ruokolainen  and Laepple et al. . Some attempts to predict the 10-year climate over regions have been done using this approach, and include assessments of the role of the internal decadal variability . To be clear, in the context of this report these studies are viewed as projections because no attempt is made to use observational estimates for the initial conditions. Essentially, an uninitialized prediction is synonymous with a projection. These projections or uninitialized predictions are referred to synonymously in the literature as `NoInit,' or `NoAssim', referring to the fact that no assimilated observations are used for the specification of the initial conditions. Additional skill can be realized by initializing the models with observations in order to predict the evolution of the internally generated component and to correct the model's response to previously imposed forcing . Again, to be clear, the assessment provided here distinguishes between predictions in which attempts are made to initialize the models with observations, and projections. See Box 11.1 and FAQ 11.1 for further details. The ENSEMBLES project , for example, has conducted a multi-model decadal retrospective prediction study, and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5  proposed a coordinated experiment that focuses on decadal, or near-term, climate prediction . Prior to these initiatives, several pioneering attempts at initialized decadal prediction were made . Results from the CMIP5 coordinated experiment  are the basis for the assessment reported here. Because the practice of decadal prediction is in its infancy, details of how to initialize the models included in the CMIP5 near-term experiment were left to the discretion of the modelling groups and are described in Meehl et al.  and Table 11.1. In CMIP5 experiments, volcanic aerosol and solar cycle variability are prescribed along the integration using observation-based values up to 2005, and assuming a climatological 11-year solar cycle and a background volcanic aerosol load in the future. These forcings are shared with CMIP5	0
historical runs  started from pre-industrial control simulations, enabling an assessment of the impact of initialization. The specification of the volcanic aerosol load and the solar irradiance in the hindcasts gives an optimistic estimate of the forecast quality with respect to an operational prediction system, where no such future information can be used. Table 11.1 summarizes forecast systems contributing to, and the initialization methods used in, the CMIP5 near-term experiment. The coordinated nature of the ENSEMBLES and CMIP5 experiments also offers a good opportunity to study multi-model ensembles  as a means of sampling model uncertainty while some modelling groups have also investigated this using perturbed parameter approaches . The relative merit of the different approaches for decadal predictions has yet to be assessed.	0
When initialized with states close to the observations, models `drift' towards their imperfect climatology , leading to biases in the simulations that depend on the forecast time. The time scale of the drift in the atmosphere and upper ocean is, in most cases, a few years . Biases can be largely removed using empirical techniques a posteriori . The bias correction or adjustment linearly corrects for model drift . The approach assumes that the model bias is stable over the prediction period . This might not be the case if, for instance, the predicted temperature trend differs from the observed trend . Figure 11.2 is an illustration of the time scale of the global SST drift, while at the same time showing the systematic error of several of the forecast systems contributing to CMIP5. It is important to note that the systematic errors illustrated here are	0

common to both decadal prediction systems and climate-change projections. The bias adjustment itself is another important source of uncertainty in climate predictions . There may be nonlinear relationships between the mean state and the anomalies, that are neglected in linear bias adjustment techniques. There are also difficulties in estimating the drift in the presence of volcanic eruptions. It has been recognized that including as many initial states as possible in computing the drift and adjusting the bias is more desirable than a greater number of ensemble members per initial state , although increasing both is desirable to obtain robust forecast quality estimates. A procedure for bias adjustment following the technique outlined above has been recommended for CMIP5 . A suitable adjustment depends also on there being a sufficient number of hindcasts for statistical robustness .	0
To reduce the impact of the drift many of the early attempts at decadal prediction  use an approach called anomaly initialization . The anomaly initialization approach attempts to circumvent model drift and the need for a time-varying bias correction. The models are initialized by adding observed anomalies to an estimate of the model mean climate. The mean model climate is subsequently subtracted from the predictions to obtain forecast anomalies. Sampling error in the estimation of the mean climatology affects the success of this approach. This is also the case for full-field initialization, although as anomaly initialisation is affected to a smaller degree by the drift, the sampling error is assumed to be smaller . The relative merits of anomaly versus full initialization are being quantified , although no initialization method was found to be definitely better in terms of forecast quality. Another less widely explored alternative is dynamic bias correction in which multi-year monthly mean analysis increments are added during the integration of the ocean model . Figure 11.2 includes predictions performed with both full and anomaly initialization systems.	0
11.2.3.2 Forecast Quality Assessment The quality of a forecast system is assessed by estimating, among others, the accuracy, skill and reliability of a set of hindcasts . These three terms--accuracy, skill and reliability--are used here in a strict technical sense. A suite of measures needs to be considered, particularly when a forecast system are compared. The accuracy of a forecast system refers to the average distance/error between forecasts and observations. The skill score is a relative measure of the quality of the forecasting system compared to some benchmark or reference forecast . The reliability, which is a property of the specific forecast system, measures the trustworthiness of the predictions. Reliability measures how well the predicted probability distribution matches the observed relative frequency of the forecast event. Accuracy and reliability are aspects of forecast quality that can be improved by improving the individual forecast systems or by combining several of them into a multi-model prediction. The reliability can be improved by a 970	0
posteriori corrections to model spread. Forecast quality can also be improved by unequal weighting , although this option has not been explored in decadal prediction to date, because a long training sample is required to obtain robust weights. The assessment of forecast quality depends on the quantities of greatest interest to those who use the information. World Meteorological Organization 's Standard Verification System  for LongRange Forecasts   outlines specifications for longrange  forecast quality assessment. These measures are also described in Jolliffe and Stephenson  and Wilks . A recommendation for a deterministic metric for decadal climate predictions is the mean square skill score , and for a probabilistic metric, the continuous ranked probability skill score  as described in Goddard et al.  and Meehl et al. . For dynamical ensemble systems, a useful measure of the characteristics of an ensemble forecast system is spread. The relative spread can be described in terms of the ratio between the mean spread around the ensemble mean and the root mean square error  of the ensemble-mean prediction, or spread-to-RMSE ratio. A ratio of 1 is considered a desirable feature for a Gaussian-distributed variable of a well-calibrated  prediction system . The importance of using statistical inference in forecast quality assessments has been recently emphasized . This is even more important when there are only small samples available  and a small number of degrees of freedom . Confidence intervals for the scores are typically computed using either parametric or bootstrap methods . The skill of seasonal predictions can vary from generation to generation  and from one generation of forecast systems to the next . This highlights the possibility that the skill of decadal predictions might also vary from one period to another. Certain initial conditions might precede more predictable near-term states than other initial conditions, and this has the potential to be reflected in predictive skill assessments. However, the short length of the period available to initialize and verify the predictions makes the analysis of the variations in skill very difficult.	0
11.2.3.4 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Decadal Prediction Experiments Indices of global mean temperature, the Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability ) and the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation  or Pacific Decadal Oscillation  are used as benchmarks to assess the ability of decadal forecast systems to predict multi-annual averages of climate variability . Initialized predictions of global mean surface air temperature  for the following year are now being performed in almost-real time . Non-initialized predictions  of the global mean temperature are statistically significantly skilful for most of the forecast ranges considered , due to the almost monotonic increase in temperature, pointing to the importance of the time-varying RF . This leads to a high  correlation of the ensemble mean prediction that varies very as a function of forecast lead time. This holds whether the changes in the external forcing  are specified  or are projected . The skill of the multi-annual global mean surface temperature improves with initialization, although this is mainly evidenced when the accuracy is measured in terms of the RMSE . An improved prediction of global mean surface temperature is evidenced by the closer fit of the initialized predictions during the 21st century . The impact of initialization is seen as a better representation of the phase of the internal variability, in particular in increasing the upper ocean heat content  and in terms of a correction of the model's forced response. The AMV  has important impacts on temperature and precipitation over land . The AMV index shows a large fraction of its variability on decadal time scales and has multi-year predictability . The AMV has been connected to multi-decadal variability of Atlantic tropical cyclones . Figure 11.3 shows that the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean has skill on multi-annual time scales, the skill being generally larger than for the single-model forecast systems . The skill of the AMV index improves with initialization  for the early forecast ranges. In particular, the RMSE is substantially reduced  with initialization for the AMV. The positive correlation of the non-initialized AMV predictions is consistent with the view that part of the recent variability is due to external forcings . Pacific decadal variability is associated with potentially important climate impacts, including rainfall over America, Asia, Africa and Aus-	0
tralia . The combination of Pacific and Atlantic variability and climate change is an important driver of multi-decadal USA drought  including key events like the American dustbowl of the 1930s . van Oldenborgh et al.  reported weak skill in hindcasting the IPO in the ENSEMBLES multi-model. Doblas-Reyes et al.  show that the ensemble-mean skill of the ENSEMBLES multi-model IPO is not statistically significant at the 95% level and shows no clear impact of the initialization, in agreement with the predictability study of Meehl et al. . On the other hand, case studies suggest that there might be some initial states that can produce skill in predicting IPO-related decadal variability for some time periods . The higher AMV and global mean temperature skill of the CMIP5 predictions with respect to the ENSEMBLES hindcasts  might be partly due to the CMIP5 multi-model using specified instead of projected aerosol loading  and solar irradiance variations during the simulations. As these forcings cannot be specified in a real forecast setting, ENSEMBLES offers an estimate of the skill closer to what could be expected from a real-time forecast system such as the one described in . The use of correct forcings nevertheless allows a more powerful test of the effect of initialization on the ability of models to reproduce past observations. Near-term prediction systems have significant skill for temperature over large regions , especially over the oceans . It has been shown that a large part of the skill corresponds to the correct representation of the long-term trend  as the skill decreases substantially after an estimate of the long-term trend is removed from both the predictions and the observations . Robust skill increase due to initialization  is limited to areas of the North Atlantic, the Indian Ocean and the southeast Pacific  , in agreement with previous results  and predictability estimates . Similar results have been found in several individual forecast systems . However, the impact of initialization on the skill in those regions, though robust  is small and not statistically significant with 90% confidence. The improvement in retrospective North Atlantic variability predictions from initialization  suggests that internal variability was important to North Atlantic variability during the past few decades. However, the interpretation of the results is complicated by the fact that the impact on skill varies slightly with the forecast quality measure used . This has been attributed to, among other things, the different impact of the predicted local trends on the scores used . Skill in hindcasts of subpolar Atlantic temperature, which is evident in Figure 11.4, is 971	0

improved more by initialization than is skill in hindcasting sub-tropical Atlantic temperature . This is relevant because the sub-polar branch of the AMV is a source of skill for multi-year North Atlantic tropical storm frequency predictions . Vecchi et al.  argued that the nominal improvement in multi-year forecasts of North Atlantic hurricane frequency was mainly due to persistence. Sugiura et al.  reported on skill in hindcasting the Pacific Decadal Oscillation  in their forecast system. They ascribed the skill to the interplay between Rossby waves and a clockwise propagation of ocean heat content anomalies along the Kuroshio-Oyashio extension and subtropical subduction pathway. However, as Figure 11.4 shows, the Pacific Ocean has the lowest temperature skill overall, with no consistent impact from initialization. The central North Pacific has zero or negative skill, which may be due to the relatively large amplitude of the interannual variability when compared to the long-term trend; the overall failure to predict the largest warming events  beyond a few months; and differences  in how surface temperature and upper ocean heat content interact for the PDO . There is a robust loss of skill due to initialization in the CMIP5 predictions over the equatorial Pacific  that has not been adequately explained. The AMV is thought to be related to the AMOC . An assessment of the impact of observing systems on AMOC predictability indicates that the recent dense observations of oceanic temperature and salinity are crucial to constraining the AMOC in one model Zhang et al. . The observing system representative of the pre-2000s was not as effective, indicating that inadequate observations in the past might also limit the impact of initialization on the predictions. This has been confirmed by Pohlmann et al.  using decadal predictions, where they also find a positive impact from initialization that agrees with Hazeleger et al. . Assessments of the skill of prediction systems to hindcast past variability in the AMOC have been attempted  although direct measures of the AMOC are far too short to underpin a reliable estimate of skill, and longer histories are poorly known . There is very low confidence in current estimates of the skill of the AMOC hindcasts. Sustained ocean observations, such as Argo, a broad global array of temperature/salinity profiling floats, and Rapid Climate Change-Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heatflux Array , will be needed to build a capability to reliably predict the AMOC . Climate prediction is, by nature, probabilistic. Probabilistic predictions are expected to be skilful, but also reliable. Decadal predictions should be evaluated on the basis of whether they give an accurate estimation of the relative frequency of the predicted outcome. This question can be addressed using, among other tools, attributes diagrams . They measure how closely the forecast probabilities of an event correspond to the mean probability of observing the event. They are based on a discrete binning of many forecast probabilities taken over a given geographical region. Figure 11.5 illustrates the CMIP5 multi-model Init and NoInit attributes diagrams for predictions of both the global and North Atlantic SSTs to be in the lower tercile (where the	0
tercile threshold has been estimated separately for the predictions and the observations). The diagrams are constructed using predictions for each grid point over the corresponding area. For perfect reliability the forecast probability and the frequency of occurrence should be equal, and the plotted points should lie on the diagonal . When the line joining the bullets  has positive slope it indicates that as the forecast probability of the event increases, so does the chance of observing the event. The predictions therefore can be considered as moderately reliable. However, if the slope of the curve is less than the slope of the diagonal, then the forecast system is overconfident. If the reliability curve is mainly horizontal, then the frequency of occurrence of the event does not depend on the forecast probabilities and the predictions contain no more information than a random guess. An ideal forecast should have a good resolution whilst retaining reliability, that is, probability forecasts should be both sharp and reliable. In agreement with Corti et al. , CMIP5 multi-model surface temperature predictions are more reliable for the North Atlantic than when considered over the global oceans, and have a tendency to be overconfident particularly for the global oceans . This means that the multi-model ensemble spread should not be considered as a robust measure of the actual uncertainty, at least for multi-annual averages. The attributes diagrams already take into account the systematic error in the simulated variability by estimating separately the event thresholds for the predictions and the observational reference. For the North Atlantic, initialization improves the reliability of the predictions, which translates into an increase of the Brier skill score, the probabilistic skill measure with respect to a naive climatological prediction  used to aggregate the information in the attributes diagram. However, the uncertainty associated with these estimates is not negligible. This is due mainly to the small sample of start dates, which has the consequence that the number of predictions with a given probability is small to give a robust estimate of the observed relative frequency . In addition to this, there are biases in the reliability diagram itself . These results suggest that the multi-model ensemble should be used with care when estimating probability forecasts or the uncertainty of the mean predictions. Given that the models used for the dynamical predictions are the same as those used for the projections, this verification also provides useful information for the assessment of the projections . The skill in hindcasting precipitation over land  is much lower than the skill in hindcasting temperature over land. This is consistent with predictability studies discussed previously  . Several regions, especially in the Northern Hemisphere  and West Africa , have skill but these regions are not statistically significant with a 95% confidence level. The positive skill in hindcasting precipitation can be attributed mostly to variable RF  as initialization improves the skill very little . The areas with positive skill agree with those where the precipitation trends of multi-annual averages are the largest . The skill in areas like West Africa might be associated with the positive AMV skill, as the AMV drives interannual variability in precipitation over this region . 973	0

Figure 11.7 shows the ratio of the spread around the ensemble mean prediction and the RMSE of the ensemble mean prediction of Init and NoInit, which in a well-calibrated system is expected to be close to 1.

However, it is difficult to obtain statistical significance with these limited samples. The low start date sampling frequency is one of the limitations of the core CMIP5 near-term prediction experiment, the other one being the short length of the period of study, limited by the availability of observational data. Results estimated with yearly start dates are more robust than with a 5-year start date frequency. However, even with 1-year start date frequency, the impact of the initialization is similar. The spatial distribution of the skill does not change substantially with the different start date frequency. The skill and the initialization	0

the first year, suggesting that skill then arises largely from the varying external forcing. The skill for extremes is generally similar to, but slightly lower than, that for the mean. Responding to the increases in decadal skill in certain regions due to initialization, a coordinated quasi-operational decadal prediction initiative has been organized . The forecast systems participating in the initiative are based on those of CMIP5 and have been evaluated for forecast quality. Statistical predictions are also included in the initiative. The most recent forecast shows  substantial warming of the north Atlantic subpolar gyre, cooling of the north Pacific throughout the next decade and cooling over most land and ocean regions and in the global average out to several years ahead. However, in the absence of explosive or frequent volcanic eruptions, global surface temperature is predicted to continue to rise and, to a certain degree, recover from the reduced rate of warming .	0
11.2.3.5 Realizing Potential Although idealized model experiments show considerable promise for predicting internal variability, realizing this potential is a challenging task. There are three main hurdles:  the limited availability of data to initialize and verify predictions,  limited progress in initialization techniques for decadal predictions and  dynamical model shortcomings that require validating how the simulated variance compares with the observed variance. It is expected that the availability of temperature and salinity data in the top 2 km of the ocean through the enhanced global deployment of Argo floats will give a step change in our ability to initialize and pre-	0
dict ocean heat and density anomalies . Another important advancement is the availability of highly accurate altimetry data, made especially useful after the launching of TOPography EXperiment /Poseidon in 1992. Argo and altimeter data became available only in 2000 and 1992 respectively, so an accurate estimate of their impact on real forecasts has to wait . In all cases, both the length of the observational data sets and the reduced coverage of the data available, especially before 2000, are serious limitations to obtain robust estimates of forecast quality. Improved initialization of other aspects such as sea ice, snow cover, frozen soil and soil moisture, may also have potential to contribute to predictive skill beyond the seasonal time scale. This could be investigated, for example by using measurements of soil moisture from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity  satellite launched in 2009, or by initializing sea ice thickness with observations from the CryoSat-2 satellite launched in 2010. Along the same line, understanding the links between the initialization and the correct prediction of both the internal and external variability should help improving forecast quality . Many of the current decadal prediction systems use relatively simple initialization schemes and do not adopt fully coupled initialization/ ensemble generation schemes. Assimilation schemes offer opportunities for fully coupled initialization including assimilation of variables such as sea ice, snow cover and soil moisture, although they present technically and scientifically challenging problems. This approach has been tested in schemes like four-dimensional variational data assimilation  and the ensemble Kalman filter . 977	0
In this section the outlook for global and regional climate up to mid-century is assessed, based on climate model projections. In contrast to the predictions discussed in Section 11.2, these projections are not initialized using observations; instead, they are initialized from historical simulations of the evolution of climate from pre-industrial conditions up to the present. The historical simulations are forced by estimates of past anthropogenic and natural climate forcing agents, and the projections are obtained by forcing the models with scenarios for future climate forcing agents. Major use is made of the CMIP5 model experiments forced by the Representative Concentration Pathway  scenarios discussed in Chapters 1 and 8. Projections of climate change in this and subsequent chapters are expressed relative to the reference period: 1986-2005. In this chapter most emphasis is given to the period 2016-2035, but some information on changes projected before and after this period  is also provided. Longer-term projections are assessed in Chapters 12 and 13. Key assessment questions addressed in this section are: What is the externally forced signal of near-term climate change, and how large is it compared to natural internal variability? From the point of view of climate impacts, the absolute magnitude of climate change may in some instances be less important than the magnitude relative to the local level of natural internal variability. Because many systems are naturally adapted to a background level of variability, it may be changes that move outside of this range that are most likely to trigger impacts that are unprecedented in the recent past  for crops). An important conclusion of the AR4  was that nearterm climate projections are not very sensitive to plausible alternative non-mitigation scenarios for GHG concentrations  scenarios; comparison with RCP scenarios is discussed in Chapter 1), that is, in the near term, different scenarios give rise to similar magnitudes and patterns of climate change.  For this reason, most of the projections presented in this chapter are based on one specific RCP scenario, RCP4.5. RCP4.5 was chosen because of its intermediate GHG forcing. However, there is greater sensitivity to other forcing agents, in particular anthropogenic aerosols . Consequently, a further question addressed in this section  is: To what extent are near-term climate projections sensitive to alternative scenarios for anthropogenic 978	0
11.3.1.1 Uncertainty in Near-term Climate Projections As discussed in Chapters 1  and 12 , climate projections are subject to several sources of uncertainty. Here three main sources are distinguished. The first arises from natural internal variability, which is intrinsic to the climate system, and includes phenomena such as variability in the mid-latitude storm tracks and the ENSO. The existence of internal variability places fundamental limits on the precision with which future climate variables can be projected. The second is uncertainty concerning the past, present and future forcing of the climate system by natural and anthropogenic forcing agents such as GHGs, aerosols, solar forcing and land use change. Forcing agents may be specified in various ways, for example, as emissions or as concentrations . The third is uncertainty related to the response of the climate system to the specified forcing agents. Quantifying the uncertainty that arises from each of the three sources is an important challenge. For projections, no attempt is made to predict the evolution of the internal variability. Instead, the statistics of this variability are included as a component of the uncertainty associated with a projection. The magnitude of internal variability can be estimated from observations  or from climate models . Challenges arise in estimating the variability on decadal and longer time scales, and for rare events such as extremes, as observational records are often too short to provide robust estimates. Uncertainty concerning the past forcing of the climate system arises from a lack of direct or proxy observations, and from observational errors. This uncertainty can influence future projections of some variables  for years or even decades ahead . Uncertainty about future forcing arises from the inability to predict future anthropogenic emissions and land use change, and natural forcings , and from uncertainties concerning carbon cycle and other biogeochemical feedbacks . The uncertainties in future anthropogenic forcing are typically investigated through the development of specific scenarios , such as the RCP scenarios . Different scenarios give rise to different climate projections, and the spread of such projections is commonly described as scenario uncertainty. The sensitivity of climate projections to alternative scenarios for future anthropogenic emissions is discussed especially in Section 11.3.6.1 To project the climate response to specified forcing agents, climate models are required. The term model uncertainty describes uncertainty about the extent to which any particular climate model provides an accurate representation of the real climate system. This uncertainty arises from approximations required in the development of models. Such approximations affect the representation of all aspects of the climate including natural internal variability and the response to external forcings. As discussed in Chapter 1 , the term model uncertainty is sometimes used in a narrower sense to describe the spread between projections generated using different models or model	0

Projections of global mean decadal mean surface air temperature to 2100 together with a quantification of the uncertainty arising from internal variability , model spread  and RCP scenario spread .  Signalto-uncertainty ratio for various global and regional averages. The signal is defined as the simulated multi-model mean change in surface air temperature relative to the simulated mean surface air temperature in the period 1986-2005, and the uncertainty is defined as the total uncertainty.

The relative importance of the different sources of uncertainty depends on the variable of interest, the space and time scales involved ), and the lead-time of the projection. Figure 11.8 provides an illustration of these dependencies based on an analysis of CMIP5 projections . In this example, the forcing-related uncertainty is estimated using the spread of projections for different RCP scenarios , while the spread among different models for individual RCP scenarios is used as a measure of the model response uncertainty. Internal variability is estimated from the models as in Hawkins and Sutton . Key points are:  the uncertainty in near-term projections is dominated by internal variability and model spread. This finding provides some of the rationale for considering near-term projections separately from long-term projections. Note, however, that the RCP scenarios do not sample the full range of uncertainty in future anthropogenic forcing, and that uncertainty in aerosol forcings in particular may be more important than is suggested by Figure 11.8 ;  internal variability becomes increasingly important on smaller space and time scales;  for projections of precipitation, scenario uncertainty is less important and  internal variability is generally more important than for projections of surface air temperature;  the full model uncertainty may well be larger or smaller than the model spread due to common errors or unrealistic models. A key quantity for any climate projection is the signal-to-noise  ratio , where the `signal' is a measure of the amplitude of the projected climate change, and the noise is a measure of the uncertainty in the projection. Higher S/N ratios indicate more robust projections of change and/or changes that are large relative to background levels of variability. Depending on the purpose, it may be useful to identify the noise with the total uncertainty, or with a specific component such as the internal variability. The evolution of the S/N ratio with lead time depends on whether the signal grows more rapidly than the noise, or vice versa. Figure 11.8  shows that, when the noise is identified with the total uncertainty, the S/N ratio for surface air temperature is typically higher at lower latitudes and has a maximum at a lead time of a few decades . The former feature is primarily a consequence of the greater amplitude of internal variability in mid-latitudes. The latter feature arises because over the first few decades, when scenario uncertainty is small, the signal grows most rapidly, but subsequently, the contribution from scenario uncertainty grows more rapidly than does the signal, so the S/N ratio falls. See Hawkins and Sutton  for further details.	0
11.3.2.1 Surface Temperature 11.3.2.1.1 Global mean surface air temperature Figure 11.9  and  show CMIP5 projections of global mean surface air temperature under RCP4.5. The 5 to 95% range for the projected anomaly for the period 2016-2035, relative to the reference period 1986-2005, is 0.47C to 1.00C . However, as discussed in Section 11.3.1.1, this range provides only a very crude measure of uncertainty, and there is no guarantee that the real world must lie within this range. Obtaining better estimates is an important challenge. One approach involves initializing climate models using observations, as discussed in Section 11.2. Figure 11.9  compares multi-model initialized climate predictions , initialized in 2011; 14 CMIP5 decadal prediction experiment models following the methodology of Meehl and Teng , initialized in 2006 with the `raw' uninitialized CMIP5 projections. The 5 to 95% range for both sets of initialized predictions is cooler  than the corresponding range for the raw projections, particularly at the upper end. The differences are partly a consequence of initializing the models in a state that is cool  as a result of the recent hiatus in global mean surface temperature rise . However, it is not yet possible to attribute all of the reasons with confidence because the raw projections are based on a different, and larger, set of models than the initialized predictions, and because of uncertainties related to the bias adjustment of the initialized predictions  Another approach to making projections involves weighting models according to some measure of their quality . A specific approach of this type, known as Allen, Stott and Kettleborough  , is based on the use of results from detection and attribution studies , in which the fit between observations and model simulations of the past is used to scale projections of the future. ASK requires specific simulations to be carried out with individual forcings , and only some of the centres participating in CMIP5 have carried out the necessary integrations. Biases in ASK-derived projections may arise from errors in the specified forcings, or in the simulated patterns of response, and/or from nonlinearities in the responses to forcings. Figure 11.9c shows the projected range of global mean surface air temperature change derived using the ASK approach for RCP4.5  applied to six models and compares this with the range derived from the 42 CMIP5 models. In this case decadal means are shown. The 5 to 95% confidence interval for the projected temperature anomaly for the period 2016-2035, based on the ASK method, is 0.39C to 0.87C. As for the initialized predictions shown in Figure 11.9b, both the lower and upper values are below the corresponding values obtained from the raw CMIP5 results, although there is substantial overlap between the two ranges. The relative cooling of the ASK results is directly related to evidence presented in	0

Chapter 10  that `This provides evidence that some CMIP5 models have a higher transient response to GHGs and a larger response to other anthropogenic forcings  than the real world .' The ASK results and the initialised predictions both suggest that those CMIP5 models that warm most rapidly over the period  to  may be inconsistent with the observations. This possibility is also suggested by comparing the models with the observed rate of warming since 1986--see Box 9.2 for a full discussion of this comparison. Lastly, Figure 11.9 also shows a statistical prediction for global mean surface air temperature, using the method of Lean and Rind , which uses multiple linear regression to decompose observed temperature variations into distinct components. This prediction is very similar to the CMIP5 multi-model median. The projections shown in Figure 11.9 assume the RCP4.5 scenario and use the 1986-2005 reference period. In Section 11.3.6 additional uncertainties associated with future forcing, climate responses and sensitivity to the choice of reference period, are discussed. An overall assessment of the likely range for future global mean surface air temperature is provided in Section 11.3.6.3. For the remaining projections in this chapter the spread among the CMIP5 models is used as a simple, but crude, measure of uncertainty.	0
The extent of agreement between the CMIP5 projections provides rough guidance about the likelihood of a particular outcome. But--as partly illustrated by the discussion above--it must be kept firmly in mind that the real world could fall outside of the range spanned by these particular models. See Section 11.3.6 for further discussion. 11.3.2.1.2 Regional and seasonal patterns of surface warming The geographical pattern of near-term surface warming simulated by the CMIP5 models  is consistent with previous IPCC reports in a number of key aspects, although weaknesses in the ability of current models to capture observed regional trends  must be kept in mind. First, temperatures over land increase more rapidly than over sea . Processes that contribute to this land-sea warming contrast include different local feedbacks over ocean and land and changes in atmospheric energy transport from ocean to land regions . Second, the projected warming in wintertime shows a pronounced polar amplification in the NH . This feature is found in virtually all coupled model projections, but the CMIP3 simulations generally appeared to underestimate this effect in comparison to	0

The right panels show an estimate of the model-estimated internal variability . Hatching in left-hand panels indicates areas where projected changes are small compared to the internal variability , and stippling indicates regions where the multi-model mean projections deviate significantly from the simulated 1986-2005 period  and where at least 90% of the models agree on the sign of change. The number of models considered in the analysis is listed in the top-right portion of the panels; from each model one ensemble member is used. See Box 12.1 in Chapter 12 for further details and discussion. Technical details are in Annex I.	0
As discussed in Sections 11.1 and 11.3.1, the signal of climate change is emerging against a background of natural internal variability. The concept of `emergence' describes the magnitude of the climate change signal relative to this background variability, and may be useful for some climate impact assessments . However, it is important to recognize that there is no single metric of emergence. It depends on user-driven choices of variable, space and time scale, of the baseline relative to which changes are measured  and of the threshold at which emergence is defined.	0
Figure 11.11 quantifies the `Time of Emergence'  of the mean warming signal relative to the recent past , based on the CMIP5 RCP4.5 projections, using a spatial resolution of 2.5 latitude x 2.5 longitude, the standard deviation of interannual variations as the measure of internal variability, and a signal-to-noise threshold of 1. Because of the dependence on user-driven choices, the most important information in Figure 11.11 is the geographical and seasonal variation in ToE, seen in the maps, and the variation in ToE between models, shown in the histograms. Consistent with Mahlstein et al. , the earliest ToE is found in the tropics, with ToE in mid-latitudes typically a decade or so later. Over North Africa and Asia, earlier ToE is found for the warm half-year  than for the cool half-year. Earlier ToE is generally found for larger space and time scales, because the variance of natural internal variability decreases with averaging . This tendency can be seen in Figure 11.11 by comparing the median value of the histograms for area averages with the area average of the median ToE inferred from the maps . The large range of values for ToE implied by different CMIP5 models, which can be as much as 30 years, is a consequence of differences in both the magnitude of the warming signal simulated by the models  and in the amplitude of simulated natural internal variability .	0

Warming is quantified as the half-year mean temperature anomaly relative to 1986-2005, and the noise as the standard deviation of half-year mean temperature derived from a control simulation of the relevant model. Central panels show the median time at which the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds a threshold value of 1 for  the October to March half year and  the April to September half year, using a spatial resolution of 2.5 x 2.5.

As discussed in the AR4 , the IPCC Technical Paper on Climate Change and Water  and the Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation , a general intensification of the global hydrological cycle, and of precipitation extremes, are expected for a future warmer climate . In this section, projected changes in the time-mean hydrological cycle are discussed; changes in extremes, are presented in Section 11.3.2.5 while processes underlying precipitation changes are treated in Chapter 7. 11.3.2.3.1 Changes in precipitation AR4 projections of the spatial patterns of precipitation change in response to GHG forcing  showed consistency between models on the largest scales  but large uncertainty on smaller scales. The consistent pattern was characterized by increases at high latitudes and in wet regions , and decreases in dry regions . Large uncertainties in the sign of projected change were seen especially in regions located on the borders between regions of increases and regions of decreases. More recent research has highlighted the fact that if models agree that the projected change is small in some sense relative to internal variability, then agreement on the sign of the change is not expected . This recognition led to the identification of subregions within the border regions, where models agree that projected changes are either zero or small . This, and other considerations, also led to the realization that the consensus among models on precipitation projections is more widespread than might have been inferred on the basis of the projections described in 984	0
the AR4 . Information on the reliability of nearterm projections can also be obtained from verification of past regional trends ; Box 11.2) Since the AR4 there has also been considerable progress in understanding the factors that govern the spatial pattern of change in precipitation , precipitation minus evaporation , and inter-model differences in these patterns. The general pattern of wet-get-wetter  and dry-get-drier has been confirmed, although with deviations in some dry regions at present that are projected to become wetter by some models, e.g., Northeast Brazil in austral summer and East Africa . It has been demonstrated that the wet-get-wetter pattern implies an enhanced seasonal precipitation range between wet and dry seasons in the tropics, and enhanced inter-hemispheric precipitation gradients . It has recently been proposed that analysis of the energy budget, previously applied only to the global mean, may provide further insights into the controls on regional changes in precipitation . Muller and O'Gorman  argue in particular that changes in radiative and surface sensible heat fluxes provide a guide to the local precipitation response over land. Projected and observed patterns of oceanic precipitation change in the tropics tend to follow patterns of SST change because of local changes in atmospheric stability, such that regions warming more than the tropics as a whole tend to exhibit an increase in local precipitation, while regions warming less tend to exhibit reduced precipitation . AR4  showed that, especially in the near term, and on regional or smaller scales, the magnitude of projected changes in mean precipitation was small compared to the magnitude of natural internal variability . Recent work has confirmed this result, and provided more quantification . Hawkins and Sutton  presented further analysis of CMIP3 results and found that, on spatial scales of the order of 1000 km, internal variability contributes 50 to 90% of the total uncertainty in all regions for projections of decadal and seasonal mean precipitation change for the next decade, and is the most important source of uncertainty for many regions for lead times up to three decades ahead . Thereafter, response uncertainty is generally dominant. Forcing uncertainty  is generally negligible for nearterm projections. The S/N ratio for projected changes in seasonal mean precipitation is highest in the subtropics and at high latitudes. Rowell  found that the contribution of response uncertainty to the total uncertainty  in local precipitation change is highest in the deep tropics, particularly over South America, Africa, the east and central Pacific, and the Atlantic. Over tropical land and summer mid-latitude continents the representation of SST c hanges, atmospheric processes, land surface processes, and the terrestrial carbon cycle all contribute to the uncertainty in projected changes in rainfall.	0
large response uncertainty is evident in the substantial spread in the magnitude of projected change simulated by different climate models . In addition, it is important to recognize--as discussed in previous sections--that models may agree and still be in error . In particular, there is some evidence from comparing observations with simulations of the recent past that climate models might be underestimating the magnitude of changes in precipitation in many regions  This evidence is discussed in detail in Chapter 9  and Box 11.2, and could imply that projected changes in precipitation are underestimated by current models. However, the magnitude of any underestimation has yet to be quantified, and is subject to considerable uncertainty. Figures 11.12 and 11.13a also highlight the large amplitude of the natural internal variability of mean precipitation. On regional scales, mean projected changes are almost everywhere smaller than the estimated standard deviation of natural internal variability. The only exceptions are the northern high latitudes and the equatorial Pacific Ocean . For zonal means  and at high latitudes only, the projected changes relative to the recent past exceed the estimated standard deviation of internal variability. Overall, zonal mean precipitation will very likely increase in high and some of the mid latitudes, and will more likely than not decrease in the subtropics. At more regional scales precipitation changes may be influenced by anthropogenic aerosol emissions and will be strongly influenced by natural internal variability.	0
11.3.2.3.2 Changes in evaporation, evaporation minus precipitation, runoff, soil moisture, relative humidity and specific humidity Because the variability of the atmospheric moisture storage is negligible, global mean increases in evaporation are required to balance increases in precipitation in response to anthropogenic forcing . The global atmospheric water content is constrained by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to increase at around 7% K-1; however, both the global precipitation and evaporation in global warming simulations increase at 1 to 3% K-1 . Changes in evapotranspiration over land are influenced not only by the response to RF, but also by the vegetation response to elevated CO2 concentrations. Physiological effects of CO2 may involve both the stomatal response, which acts to restrict transpiration , and an increase in plant growth and leaf area, which acts to increase evapotranspiration . Simulation of the latter process requires the inclusion of vegetation models that allow spatial and temporal variability in the amount of active biomass, either by changes in the phenological cycle or changes in the biome structure. In response to GHG forcing, dry land areas tend to show a reduction of evaporation and often precipitation, accompanied by a drying of the soil and an increase of surface temperature, in response to decreases 986	0
in latent heat fluxes from the surface . Jung et al.  use a mixture of observations and models to illustrate a recent global mean decline in land surface evaporation due to soil-moisture limitations. Accompanying precipitation effects are more subtle, as there are significant uncertainties and large geographical variations regarding the soil-moisture precipitation feedback . AR4 projections  of annual mean soil moisture changes for the 21st century showed a tendency for decreases in the subtropics, southern South America and the Mediterranean region, and increases in limited areas of east Africa and central Asia. Changes seen in other regions were mostly not consistent or statistically significant. AR4 projections of 21st century runoff changes  showed consistency in sign among models indicating annual mean reductions in southern Europe and increases in Southeast Asia and at high northern latitudes. Projected changes in global mean runoff associated with the physiological effects of doubled CO2 concentrations show increases of 6 to 8% relative to pre-industrial levels, an increase that is comparable to that simulated in response to RF changes  . Gosling et al.  assess the projected impacts of climate change on river runoff from global and basin-scale hydrological models obtaining increased runoff with global warming in the Liard , Rio Grande  and Xiangxi  basins and decrease for the Okavango . Consideration of hydrological drought conditions employs a range of different dryness indicators, such as soil moisture or other drought indices that integrate precipitation and evaporation effects . There are large uncertainties in regional drought projections , and very few studies have addressed the near-term future . In order to provide an indication of future changes of water availability, Figure 11.13b presents zonal mean changes in precipitation minus evaporation  from CMIP5. As in the case of precipitation , the uncertainty is dominated by model differences as opposed to natural variability . The results are consistent with the wet-get-wetter and dry-get-drier pattern : In the high latitudes and the tropics, most of the models project zonal-mean increases in P - E, which over land would need to be compensated by increases in runoff . In contrast, zonal mean projected changes in the subtropics are negative, indicating decreases in water availability. Although this pattern is evident in most or all of the models, and although several studies project drought increases in the near term future , the assessment is debated in the literature based on discrepancies in the recent past and due to natural variability . The global distribution of the 2016-2035 changes in annual mean evaporation, evaporation minus precipitation , surface runoff, soil moisture, relative humidity and surface-level specific humidity from the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble under RCP4.5 are shown in Figure 11.14. Changes in evaporation over land , are mostly positive with the largest values at northern high latitudes, in agreement with projected temperature increases . Over the oceans, evaporation is also projected to increase in most regions. Projected changes	0
the subtropics several areas exhibit increases in , in particular in Europe, western Australia and central-western USA. However, in most locations changes are smaller than internal variability. Annual mean shallow soil moisture  shows decreases in most subtropical regions  and in central Europe, and increases in northern mid-to-high latitudes. Projected changes are larger than the estimated internal variability only in southern Africa, the Amazon region and Europe. Projected changes in runoff  show decreases in northern Africa, western Australia, southern Europe and southwestern USA and increases larger than the internal variability in northwestern Africa, southern Arabia and southeastern South America associated to the projected changes in precipitation . Owing to the simplified hydrological models in many CMIP5 climate models, the projections of soil moisture and runoff have large model uncertainties. Changes in near-surface specific humidity are positive, with the largest values at northern high latitudes when expressed in percentage terms . This is consistent with the projected increases in temperature when assuming constant relative humidity. These changes are larger than the estimated standard deviation of internal variability almost everywhere: the only exceptions are oceanic regions such as the northern North Atlantic and around Antarctica. In comparison, absolute changes in near-surface relative humidity  are much smaller, on the order of a few percent, with general decreases over most land areas, and small increases over the oceans. Significant decreases relative to natural variability are projected in the Amazonia, southern Africa and Europe, although the model agreement in these regions is low.	0
11.3.2.4 Atmospheric Circulation 11.3.2.4.1 Northern Hemisphere extratropical circulation In the NH extratropics, some Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models  indicate changes to atmospheric circulation from anthropogenic forcing by the mid-21st century, including a poleward shift of the jet streams and associated zonal mean storm tracks  and a strengthening of the Atlantic storm track , Figure 11.15. Consistent with this, the CMIP5 AOGCMs exhibit an ensemble mean increase in the North Atlantic Oscillation  and Northern Annular Model  indices by 2050, especially in autumn and winter . However, there are reasons to be cautious over these near-term projections. Although models simulate the broad features of the large-scale circulation well, there remain quite significant biases in many models . The response of the NH circulation can be sensitive to small changes in model formulation , and to features that are known to be poorly simulated in many 988	0
climate models. These features include high- and low-latitude physics , ocean circulation , tropical circulation  and stratospheric dynamics . As a result, there is considerable model uncertainty in the response of the NH storm track position , stationary waves  and the jet streams . Further, CMIP5 models show that the response of NH extratropical circulation to even strong GHG forcing remains weak compared to recent multidecadal variability and a recent detection and attribution study suggests that tropospheric ozone and aerosol changes may have been a key driver to NH extratropical circulation changes . Some AOGCMs simulate multi-decadal NAO variability as large as that recently observed with no external forcing . This suggests that internal variability could dominate the anthropogenically forced response in the near term . Some studies have predicted a shift to the negative phase of the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation  over the coming few decades, with potential impacts on atmospheric circulation around the Atlantic sector . It has also been suggested that there may be significant changes in solar forcing over the next few decades, which could have an influence on NAO-related atmospheric circulation , although these predictions are highly uncertain . There is only medium confidence in near-term projections of a northward shift of NH storm track and westerlies, and an increase of the NAO/NAM because of the large response uncertainty and the potentially large influence of internal variability. 11.3.2.4.2 Southern Hemisphere extratropical circulation Increases in GHGs, and related dynamical processes, are projected to lead to poleward shifts in the annual mean position of Southern Hemisphere  extratropical storm tracks and winds . A key issue in projections of near-term SH extratropical circulation change is the extent to which changes driven by stratospheric ozone recovery will counteract changes driven by increasing GHGs. Several observational and modeling studies  indicate that, over the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the observed summertime poleward shift of the westerly jet ) has been caused primarily by the depletion of stratospheric ozone, with increasing GHGs contributing only a smaller fraction to the observed trends. The latest generation of climate models project substantially smaller poleward trends in SH atmospheric circulation in austral summer over the coming half century compared to those over the late 20th century, as the recovery of stratospheric ozone will oppose the effects of continually increasing GHGs . Locally, internal variability may be a dominant contributor to near-term changes in lower-tropospheric zonal winds . The average 2016-2035 SH extratropical storm tracks and zonal	0
Increases in GHGs are expected to lead to a poleward shift of the Hadley Circulation . Relative to the late 20th century, the tendency towards a poleward expansion of the Hadley Circulation will start to emerge by the mid-2030s, with certain intra-model consensus in the SH expansion, despite the counteracting effect of ozone recovery . As with near-term changes in SH extratropical circulation, a key for near-term projections of the structure of the SH Hadley Circulation is the extent to which future stratospheric ozone recovery will counteract the impact of GHGs. The poleward expansion of the Hadley Circulation, particularly of the SH branch during austral summer, during the later decades of the 20th century has been largely attributed to the combined impact of stratospheric ozone depletion  and the concurrent increase in GHGs  as discussed in the previous section.

contraction of the tropics and the tropical circulation . So future solar variations and volcanic activities could also lead to variations in the width of the Hadley Cell. The poleward extent of the Hadley Circulation and associated dry zones can exhibit substantial internal variability  that can be as large as its near-term projected changes . There is also considerable uncertainty in the amplitude of the poleward shift of the Hadley Circulation in response to GHGs across multiple AOGCMs . It is likely that the poleward extent of the Hadley Circulation will increase through the mid-21st century. However, because of the counteracting impacts of future changes in stratospheric ozone and GHG concentrations, it is unlikely that it will continue to expand poleward in the SH as rapidly as it did in recent decades. The Hadley Cell expansion in the NH has been largely attributed to the low-frequency variability of the SST , the increase of black carbon  and tropospheric ozone . Internal variability in the poleward edge of the NH Hadley Circulation is large relative the radiatively forced signal (Figure 11.16. Given the complexity in the forcing mechanism of the NH expansion and the uncertainties in future concentrations of tropospheric pollutants, there is low confidence in the character of near-term changes to the structure of the NH Hadley Circulation.	0
Extreme events in a changing climate are the subject of Chapter 3  of the IPCC Special Report on Extremes . This previous IPCC chapter provides an assessment of more than 1000 studies. Here the focus is on near-term aspects and an assessment of more recent studies is provided. 11.3.2.5.1 Temperature extremes In the AR4 , cold episodes were projected to decrease significantly in a future warmer climate and it was considered very likely that heat waves would be more intense, more frequent and last longer towards the end of the 21st century. These conclusions have generally been confirmed in subsequent studies addressing both global scales  and regional scales . In the SREX assessment it is	0
Global climate models and theoretical considerations suggest that a warming of the tropics should lead to a weakening of the zonally asymmetric or Walker Circulation . Aerosol forcing can modify both Hadley and Walker Circulations, which--depending on the details of the aerosol forcing--may lead to temporary reversals or enhancements in any GHG-driven weakening of the Walker Circulation . Meanwhile, the strength and structure of the Walker Circulation are impacted by internal climate variations, such as the ENSO , the PDO  and the IPO (Power et al., 1999, 2006; Meehl and Hu, 2006; Meehl and Arblaster, 2011; Power and Kociuba, 2011b;	0
Meehl and Arblaster, 2012; Meehl et al., 2013a). Even on time scales of 30 to 100 years, substantial variations in the strength of the Pacific Walker Circulation in the absence of changes in RF are possible . Estimated near-term weakening of the Walker Circulation from CMIP3 models under the A1B scenario  are very likely to be smaller than the impact of internal climate variations over 50-year time scales . There is also considerable response uncertainty in the amplitude of the weakening of Walker Circulation in response to GHG increase across multiple AOGCMs . Thus, there is low confidence in projected near-term changes to the Walker Circulation. It is very likely that there will be decades in which the Walker Circulation strengthens and weakens due to internal variability through the mid-century as the externally forced change is small compared to internally generated decadal variability.	0

concluded that increases in the number of warm days and nights and decreases in the number of cold days and nights are virtually certain on the global scale. None of the aforementioned studies specifically addressed the near term. However, detection and attribution studies  show that temperature extremes have already increased in many regions, consistent with climate change projections, and analyses of CMIP5 global projections show that this trend will continue and become more notable. The CMIP5 model ensemble exhibits a significant decrease in the frequency of cold nights, an increase in the frequency of warm days and nights and an increase in the duration of warm spells . These changes are particularly evident in global mean projections . Figure 11.17 shows that for the next few decades--as discussed in the introduction to the current chapter--these changes are remarkably insensitive to the emission scenario considered . In most land regions and in the near-term, the frequency of warm days and warm nights will thus likely continue to increase, while that of cold days and cold nights will likely continue to decrease.	0
Near-term projections from General Circulation Model-Regional Climate Model  model chains  for Europe are shown in Figure 11.18, displaying near-term changes in mean and extreme temperature  and precipitation  relative to the reference period 1986- 2005. In terms of mean June, July and August  temperatures , projections show a warming of 0.6C to 1.5C, with highest changes over the land portion of the Mediterranean. The north-south gradient in the projections is consistent with the AR4. Daytime extreme summer temperatures in southern and central Europe are projected to warm substantially faster than mean temperatures . This difference between changes in mean and extremes can be explained by increases in interannual and/or synoptic variability, or increases in diurnal temperature range . There is some evidence, however, that this effect is overestimated in some of the models , leading to a potential overestimation of the projected Mediterranean summer mean warming . With regard to near-term projections of	0

For temperature, projected changes  are displayed in terms of ensemble mean changes of  mean seasonal surface temperature, and  the 90th percentile of daily maximum temperatures.

record heat compared to record cold  show, for one model, that over the USA the ratio of daily record high temperatures to daily record low temperatures could increase from an early 2000s value of roughly 2 to 1 to a mid-century value of about 20 to 1. In terms of December, January and February  temperatures , projections show a warming of 0.3C to 1.8C, with the largest changes in the N-NE part of Europe. This characteristic pattern of changes tends to persist to the end of century . In contrast to JJA temperatures, daytime high-percentile  winter temperatures are projected to warm slower than mean temperatures , while low-percentile  winter temperatures warm faster than the mean. This behaviour is indicative of reductions in internal variability, which may be linked to changes in storm track activity, reductions in diurnal temperature range and changes in snow cover . 11.3.2.5.2 Heavy precipitation events	0
For the 21st century, the AR4 and the SREX concluded that heavy precipitation events were likely to increase in many areas of the globe . Since AR4, a larger number of additional studies have been published using global and regional climate models . For the near term, CMIP5 global projections  confirm a clear tendency for increases in heavy precipitation events in the global mean, but there are significant variations across regions . Past observations have also shown that interannual and decadal variability in mean and heavy precipitation are large, and are in addition strongly affected by internal variability , volcanic forcing and anthropogenic aerosol loads . In general models have difficulties in representing these variations, particularly in the tropics . Thus the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events will likely increase over many land areas in the near term, but this trend will not be apparent in all regions, because of natural variability and possible influences of anthropogenic aerosols. Simulations with regional climate models demonstrate that the response in terms of heavy precipitation events to anthropogenic climate change may become evident in some but not all regions in the near term. For instance, ENSEMBLES projections for Europe  confirm the previous IPCC results that changes in mean precipitation as well as heavy precipitation events are characterized by a pronounced north-south gradient in the extratropics, especially in the winter season, with precipitation increases in the higher latitudes and decreases in the subtropics. Although this pattern starts to emerge in the near term, the projected changes are statistically significant only in a fraction of the domain. The results are affected by both changes in water vapour content as induced by large-scale warming and large-scale circulation changes. Figure 11.18e-h also shows that mid- and high-latitude projections for changes in DJF extremes and means are qualitatively similar in the near term, at least for the event size considered.	0
Previous work reviewed in AR4 has established that extreme precipitation events may increase substantially stronger than mean precipitation amounts. More specifically, extreme events may increase with the atmospheric water vapour content, that is, up to the rate of the Clausius-Clapeyron  relationship . More recent work suggests that increases beyond this threshold may occur for short-term events associated with thunderstorms  and tropical convection . A number of studies showed strong dependencies on location and season, but confirm the existence of significant deviations from the CC scaling . Studies with cloud-resolving models generally support the existence of temperature-precipitation relations that are close to or above  the CC relation . 11.3.2.5.3 Tropical cyclones The projected response of tropical cyclones  at the end of the 21st century is summarized in Section 14.6.1 and the IPCC Special Report on Extremes  . Relative to the number of studies focussing on projections of TC activity at the end of the 21st century ; the North Atlantic  stands out as the basin with most studies. In the NA, there are mixed projections for basinwide TC frequency, suggesting significant decreases  or non-significant changes . Multi-model mean projected NA TC frequency changes based on CMIP3 and CMIP5 over the first half of the 21st century were smaller than the overall uncertainty estimated from the Coupled General Circulation Models , with internal climate variability being a leading source of uncertainty through the mid-21st century . Therefore, based on the limited literature available, the conflicting near-term projections in basins with more than one study, the large influence of internal variability, the lack of confidently detected/attributed changes in TC activity  and the conflicting projections for basin-wide TC frequency even at the end of the 21st century , there is currently low confidence in basin-scale and global projections of trends in tropical cyclone frequency to the mid-21st century. Exploring different hurricane intensity measures, two studies project near-term increases of NA hurricane intensity , driven in large part by projected reductions in NA tropospheric aerosols in CMIP5 future forcing scenarios. Studies project near-term increases in the frequency Category 4-5 TCs in the NA  and southwest Pacific . Published studies agree in the sign of projected mid-century intensity change , but the only basin with more than one study exploring intensity is the NA. For the NA, an estimate of the time scale of emergence of projected changes in intense TC frequency exceeds 60 years , although that estimate depends crucially on the amplitude of internal climate variations of intense hurricane frequency , which remains poorly constrained at the moment. Therefore, there is low confidence in near-term TC intensity projections in all TC basins.	0
Globally averaged surface and near-surface ocean temperatures are projected by AOGCMs to warm over the early 21st century, in response to both present day atmospheric concentrations of GHGs  and projected future changes in RF . Globally averaged SST shows substantial year-to-year and decade-to-decade variability , whereas the variability of depth-averaged ocean temperatures is much less . The rate at which globally averaged surface and depth-averaged temperatures rise in response to a given scenario for RF shows a considerable spread between models , due to differences in climate sensitivity and ocean heat uptake . In the CMIP5 models under all RCP forcing scenarios, globally averaged SSTs are projected to be warmer over the near term relative to 1986-2005 . A key uncertainty in the future evolution of globally averaged oceanic temperature are possible future large volcanic eruptions, which could	0
There are regional variations in the projected amplitude of ocean temperature change  which are influenced by ocean circulation as well as surface heating , including changes in tropospheric aerosol concentrations . Inter-decadal variability of upper ocean temperatures is larger in mid-latitudes, particularly in the NH, than in the tropics. A consequence of this contrast is that it will take longer in the mid-latitudes than in the tropics for the anthropogenic warming signal to emerge from the noise of internal variability . Projected changes to thermal structure of the tropical Indo-Pacific are strongly dependent on the future behaviour of the Walker Circulation , in addition to changes in heat transport and changes in surface heat fluxes. It is likely that internal climate variability will be a dominant contributor to changes in the depth and tilt of the equatorial thermocline, and the strength of the east-west gradient of SST across the Pacific through the mid-21st century; thus it is likely there will be multi-year periods with increases or decreases in these measures.	0
in the subtropical North Atlantic, and decreases in the west Pacific warm pool region . Models generally predict increases in salinity in the tropical and  subtropical Atlantic, and decreases in the western tropical Pacific over the next few decades  . These projected decreases in the Atlantic and in the western tropical Pacific are considered likely. Projected near-term increases in freshwater flux into the Arctic Ocean produce a fresher surface layer and increased transport of fresh water into the North Atlantic . Such contributions to decreased density of the ocean surface layer in the North Atlantic could act to reduce deep ocean convection there and contribute to a near-term reduction of strength of Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation . However, the strength of the AMOC can also be modulated by changes in temperature, such as those from changing RF .	0
11.3.3.3 Circulation As discussed in previous assessment reports, the AMOC is generally projected to weaken over the next century in response to increase in atmospheric GHG. However, the rate and magnitude of weakening is very uncertain. Response uncertainty is a major contributor in the near term, but the influence of anthropogenic aerosols and natural RFs  cannot be neglected, and could be as important as the influence of GHGs . For example, the rate of weakening of the AMOC in two models with different climate sensitivities is quite different, with the less sensitive model  showing less weakening and a more rapid recovery than the more sensitive model . In addition, the natural variability of the AMOC on decadal time scales is poorly known and poorly understood, and could dominate any anthropogenic response in the near term . The AMOC is known to play an important role in the	0
decadal variability of the North Atlantic Ocean, but climate models show large differences in their simulation of both the amplitude and spectrum of AMOC variability . In some AOGCMs changes in SH surface winds influence the evolution of the AMOC on time scales of many decades , so the delayed response to SH wind changes, driven by the historical reduction in stratospheric ozone along with its projected recovery, could be an additional confounding issue . Overall, it is likely that there will be some decline in the AMOC by 2050, but decades during which the AMOC increases are also to be expected. There is low confidence in projections of when an anthropogenic influence on the AMOC might be detected . Projected changes to oceanic circulation in the Indo-Pacific are strongly dependent on future response of the Walker Circulation , the near-term projected weakening of which is smaller than the expected variability on time scales of decades to years . Taking variability into account, there is medium confidence in a weakening of equatorial Pacific circulation, including equatorial upwelling and the shallow subtropical overturning in the Pacific, and the Indonesian Throughflow over the coming decades.	0
This section assesses projected near-term changes of elements of the cryosphere. These consist of sea ice, snow cover and near-surface permafrost , changes to the Arctic Ocean and possible abrupt changes involving the cryosphere. Glaciers and ice sheets are addressed in Chapter 13. Here near-term changes in the geographical coverage of sea ice, snow cover and near-surface permafrost are assessed. Trends due to changes in external forcing exist alongside considerable interannual and decadal variability. This complicates our ability to make specific, precise short-term projections, and delays the emergence of a forced signal above the noise.	0
11.3.4.1 Sea Ice Though most of the CMIP5 models project a nearly ice-free Arctic  at the end of summer by 2100 in the RCP8.5 scenario , some show large changes in the near term as well. Some previous models project an ice-free summer period in the Arctic Ocean by 2040 , and even as early as the late 2030s using a criterion of 80% sea ice area loss . By scaling six CMIP3 models to recent observed September sea ice changes, a nearly ice-free Arctic in September is projected to occur by 2037, reaching the first quartile of the distribution for timing of September sea ice loss by 2028 . However, a number of models that have fairly thick Arctic sea ice produce a slower near-term decrease in sea ice extent compared to observations . Based on a linear extrapolation into the future of the recent sea ice volume trend from a hindcast simulation conducted with a regional model of the Arctic sea ice-ocean system  projected that	0
it would take only until about 2016 to reach a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in summer. However, such an approach not only neglects the effect of year-to-year or longer-term variability  but also ignores the negative feedbacks that can occur when the sea ice cover becomes thin . Mahlstein and Knutti  estimated the annual mean global surface warming threshold for nearly ice-free Arctic conditions in September to be ~2C above the present derived from both CMIP3 models and observations. An analysis of CMIP3 model simulations indicates that for near-term predictions the dominant factor for decreasing sea ice is increased ice melt, and reductions in ice growth play a secondary role . Arctic sea ice has larger volume loss when there is thicker ice initially across the CMIP3 models, with a projected accumulated mass loss of about 0.5 m by 2020, and roughly 1.0 m by 2050, with considerable model spread . The CMIP3 models tended to under-estimate the observed rapid decline of summer Arctic sea ice during the satellite era, but these recent trends are more accurately simulated in the CMIP5 models . For CMIP3 models, results indicate that the changes in Arctic sea ice mass budget over the 21st century are related to the late 20th century mean sea ice thickness distribution , average sea ice thickness , fraction of thin ice cover  and oceanic heat transport to the Arctic . Acceleration of sea ice drift observed over the last three decades, underestimated in CMIP3 projections , and the presence of fossil-fuel and biofuel soot in the Arctic environment , could also contribute to ice-free late summer conditions over the Arctic in the near term. Details on the transition to an ice-free summer over the Arctic are presented in Chapter 12 . The discussion in Section 12.4.6.1 makes the case for assessing nearterm projections of Arctic sea ice by weighting/recalibrating the models based on their present-day Arctic sea ice simulations, with a credible underlying physical basis in order to increase confidence in the results, and accounting for the potentially large imprint of natural variability on both observations and model simulations . A subselection of a set of CMIP5 models that fits those criteria, following the methodology proposed by Massonnet et al. , is applied in Chapter 12  to the full set of models that provided the CMIP5 database with sea ice output. Among the five selected models, four project a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in September  before 2050 for RCP8.5, the earliest and latest years of near disappearance of the sea ice pack being about 2040 and about 2060, respectively. The potential irreversibility of the Arctic sea ice loss and the possibility of an abrupt transition toward an ice-free Arctic Ocean are discussed in Section 12.5.5.7. In light of all these results and others discussed in greater detail in Section 12.4.6.1, it is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin all year round during the 21st century as the annual mean global surface temperature rises. It is also likely that the Arctic Ocean will become nearly ice-free in September before the middle of the century for high GHG emissions such as those corresponding to RCP8.5 . 995	0
In early 21st century simulations, Antarctic sea ice cover is projected to decrease in the CMIP5 models, though CMIP3 and CMIP5 models simulate recent decreases in Antarctic sea ice extent compared to slight increases in the observations . However, there is the possibility that melting of the Antarctic ice sheet could be changing the vertical ocean temperature stratification around Antarctica and encourage sea ice growth . This and other evidence discussed in Section 12.4.6.1 leads to the assessment that there is low confidence in Antarctic sea ice model projections that show near-term decreases of sea ice cover because of the wide range of model responses and the inability of almost all of the models to reproduce the mean seasonal cycle, interannual variability and overall increase of the Antarctic sea ice areal coverage observed during the satellite era .	0
2 to 3 m; see Callaghan et al.  and see glossary for detailed definition), and thaw depth deepening over much of the permafrost area . As discussed in more detail in Section 12.4.6.2, these projections have increased credibility compared to the previous generation of models assessed in the AR4 because current climate models represent permafrost more accurately . The reduction in annual mean near-surface permafrost area for the 2016-2035 time period compared to the 1986-2005 reference period for the CMIP5 models  for the NH for the four RCP scenarios is 21%  5% , 18%  6% , 18%  3%  and 20%  5% .	0
Decreases of snow cover extent  are strongly connected to a shortening of seasonal snow cover duration  and are related to both precipitation and temperature changes . This has implications for snow on sea ice where loss of sea ice area in autumn delays snowfall accumulation, with CMIP5 multi-model mean values of snow depth in April north of 70N reduced from about 28 cm to roughly 18 cm for the 2031-2050 period compared to the 1981-2000 average . The snow accumulation season by mid-century in one model is projected to begin later in autumn, with the melt season initiated earlier in the spring . As discussed in greater detail in Section 12.4.6.2, projected increases in snowfall across much of the northern high latitudes act to increase snow amounts, but warming reduces the fraction of precipitation that falls as snow. In addition, the reduction of Arctic sea ice also provides an increased moisture source for snowfall . Whether the average SCE decreases or increases by mid-century depends on the balance between these competing factors. The dividing line where models transition from simulating increasing or decreasing maximum snow water equivalent roughly coincides with the -20C isotherm in the mid-20th century November to March mean surface air temperature . The projected change of SCE over some regions is inconsistent with that of extreme snowfall, a major contributor to SCE. For instance, SCE is projected to decrease over northern China by the mid-21st century , while the extreme snowfall events over the region are projected to increase . Time series of projected changes in relative SCE  are shown in Figure 12.32. Multi-model averages from the CMIP5 archive  show percentage decreases of NH SCE  1 standard deviation for the 2016-2035 time period for a March to April average using a 15% extent threshold for the four RCP scenarios as follows: RCP2.6: -5.2%  1.9% ; RCP4.5: -5.3%  1.5% ; RCP6.0: -4.5%  1.2% ; RCP8.5: -6.0%  2.0% .	0
The future evolution of atmospheric composition is determined by the chemical-physical processes in the atmosphere, forced primarily by anthropogenic and natural emissions and by interactions with the biosphere and ocean . Twenty-first century projections of the chemically reactive GHGs, including methane , nitrous oxide  and ozone , as well as aerosols, are assessed here . Future air pollution, specifically ground-level O3 and PM2.5 , is also assessed here . The impact of changes in natural emissions and deposition through altered land use  and production of food or biofuels  on atmospheric composition and air quality are not assessed here. Projected CO2 abundances are discussed in Chapters 6 and 12. Projections for the 21st century are based predominantly on the CMIP5 models that included atmospheric chemistry and the related ACCMIP  models, driven by the RCP emission and climate scenarios. These and the earlier SRES scenarios include only direct anthropogenic emissions. Natural emissions may also change with biosphere feedbacks in response to climate or land use change . Emphasis is placed on evaluating the 21st-century RCP scenarios from emissions to abundance, summarized in tables in Annex II. For the well-mixed greenhouse gases , the effective radiative forcing  in both RCP and SRES scenarios increases similarly before 2040 with little spread , but by 2050 the RCP2.6 scenario diverges, falling well below the envelope containing both the SRES and other RCP scenarios. National and regional regulations implemented on emissions contributing to ground-level ozone and PM2.5 pollution influence global atmospheric chemistry and climate , as was recognized in the TAR . Ozone and aerosols are radiatively active species  and many of their precursors serve as indirect GHGs , carbon monoxide , Non Methane Volatile Organic Compounds ) by changing the atmospheric oxidative capacity, and thereby the lifetimes and abundances of CH4, hydrofluorocarbons  and tropospheric O3 . Consequently their evolution can influence near-term climate	0
both regionally and globally . The RCP and SRES scenarios differ greatly in terms of the short-lived air pollutants and aerosol climate forcing. The CMIP3 climate simulations driven by the SRES scenarios projected a wide range of future air pollutant trajectories, including unconstrained growth that resulted in very large tropospheric O3 increases . Subsequently, the near-term projections of current legislation  and maximum feasible reductions  emissions illustrated the impacts of air pollution control strategies on air quality, global atmospheric chemistry and near-term climate . The RCP scenarios applied in the CMIP5 climate models all assume a continuation of current trends in air pollution policies  and thus do not cover the range of future pollutant emissions found in the literature, specifically those with higher pollutant emissions ; see Chapter 8. The new RCP emissions are compared to the older SRES and other published emission scenarios in Annex II  and Figures 8.2 and 8.SM.1. By 2030 the RCP aerosol and ozone precursor emissions are smaller than SRES by factors of 1.2 to 3. For these shortlived air pollutants, the spread across RCPs by 2030 is much smaller than the range between the CLE and MFR scenarios: 12% vs. 31% for nitrogen oxides; 17% vs. 60% for sulphate; 5% vs. 11% for carbon monoxide. BC aerosol emissions also vary little across the RCPs: 4% range in 2030; 15% in 2100. Most of this spread is due to uncertain projections for the rapidly industrializing nations. From 2000 to 2030, sulphur dioxide  emissions decline in the RCPs by -15% to -8% per decade, within the range of the MFR and CLE scenarios , but far below the SRES range . Evaluation of recent trends in SO2 emissions shows a trend similar to the near-term RCP projections , but independent estimates for recent trends in other aerosol species are not available. The RCP trend in NOx emissions  is likewise within the CLE-MFR range, but far below the SRES trends . For OC and BC emissions, the RCP trend lies between the SRES B1/A2 range. A simple sum of the main four aerosol emissions  in the SRES vs. RCP scenarios indicates that the CMIP3 simulations driven by the SRES scenarios have about 40% more aerosols in 2000 than the CMIP5 simulations driven by the RCP scenarios. On average, these aerosols increase by 9% per decade in the SRES scenarios but decrease by 5% per decade in the RCP scenarios over the near term. By 2030, the CMIP3 models thus include up to three times more anthropogenic aerosols under the SRES scenarios than the CMIP5 models driven by the RCP scenarios .	0
the current best understanding of natural and anthropogenic emissions, atmospheric chemistry and biogeochemistry and RF of climate  . Rather, the best estimates of atmospheric abundances and associated RF include a more complete atmospheric chemistry description and a fuller set of uncertainties than considered in the RCPs provided to the CMIP5 models. While this widens the range of climate forcing for each individual scenario, this uncertainty generally remains smaller than the range across the four RCP scenarios. 11.3.5.1.1 Methane, nitrous oxide and the fluorinated gases Kyoto GHG abundances projected to year 2100 are given in Annex II  as both RCP published values  and derived from the RCP anthropogenic emissions pathways. The latter includes current best estimates of atmospheric chemistry and natural sources, with uncertainties . Emissions of CH4 and N2O, primarily from the agriculture, forestry and other land use sectors  are uncertain, typically by 25% or more . Following the method of Prather et al.  a best estimate and uncertainty range for the year 2011 anthropogenic and natural emissions of CH4 and N2O are derived using updated AR5 values . The re-scaled RCP& anthropogenic-only emissions of CH4 and N2O are given in Tables AII.2.2 and AII.2.3 and differ from the published RCPs by a single scale factor for each species. An uncertainty range for 2011 values  is applied to all subsequent years. Abundances are then integrated using these rescaled RCP& anthropogenic emissions, the best estimate for natural emissions, and a model projecting changes in tropospheric OH . Similar scaling to match current observational constraints  was done for the SRES emissions  and the RCPs . However, these earlier harmonizations used older values for lifetimes and natural sources, and did not provide estimates of uncertainty. Combining CH4 observations, lifetime estimates for the present day, the ACCMIP studies, plus estimated limits on changing natural sources, gives a year 2011 total anthropogenic CH4 emission of 354  45 Tg yr-1  . The RCP total emission lies within 10% of this value, and thus the scaling factor between the RCP& and RCP total emission, is small . Projection of the tropospheric OH lifetime of CH4  is based on the ACCMIP simulations of the RCPs for 2100 time slice simulations , other modelling studies  and multi-model sensitivity analyses of key factors  that includes uncertainties in emissions from agricultural, forest and land use sources, in atmospheric lifetimes, and in chemical feedbacks and loss. Lifetimes, and thus future CH4 abundances, decrease slowly under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, remain almost constant under RCP6.0 and increase slowly under RCP8.5. Future changes in natural sources of CH4 due to land use and climate change are included in a few CMIP5 models and may alter future CH4 abundances , but there is limited evidence, and thus these changes are not included in the RCP& projections.	0

The resulting best estimates of total CH4 anthropogenic emissions and abundances  are compared with RCP values in Figure 11.21. For RCP2.6, the CH4 abundance is projected to decline continuously over the century by about 30%, whereas in RCP 4.5 and 6.0 it peaks mid-century and then declines to below the year 2011 abundance by the end of the century. Throughout the century, the uncertainty in CH4 abundance for an individual scenario is less than range from RCP2.6 to RCP8.5. For example, by year 2020 the spread in CH4 abundance across the RCPs is already large, 1720 to 1920 ppb, with uncertainty in each scenario estimated at only 20 ppb. The likely range for RCP& CH4 is 30% wider than that in the RCP CH4 abundances used to force the CMIP5 models : by year 2100 the likely range of RCP8.5& CH4 abundance extends 520 ppb above the single-valued RCP8.5 CH4 abundance, and RCP2.6& CH4 extends 230 ppb below RCP2.6 CH4. Substantial effort has gone into identifying and quantifying individual sources of N2O  but less into evaluating its lifetime and chemical feedbacks. Recent multi-model, chemistry-climate studies 998	0
 project a more vigorous stratospheric overturning by 2100 that is expected to shorten the N2O lifetime , but no evaluation of the lifetime is reported. Here we combine observations of N2O , with two modern studies of the lifetime , and a Monte Carlo method  to estimate a year 2011 total anthropogenic emission of 6.7  1.3 TgN yr-1 . All RCP N2O  emissions are reduced by 20% so that year 2011 values are consistent with an observationally constrained budget using a longer lifetime than adopted by the RCPs . The N2O lifetime  is projected to decrease by 2 to 4% by year 2100, due to changing circulation and chemistry in the stratosphere  and to the negative chemical feedback on its own lifetime . In the near term, the spread in N2O across RCP&s is small: 330 to 332  4 ppb in year 2020; 346 to 365  11 ppb in year 2050. By year 2100, the range of best-estimate N2O concentrations across the RCP&s  is 20% smaller than that across the RCPs , but the likely range in RCP&s encompasses the RCP range. Recent measurements show some discrepancies with bottom-up inventories of the industrially produced, synthetic fluorinated  gases . European HFC-23 emissions are greatly under-reported  while HFC-125 and 152a are roughly consistent with emissions inventories . Globally, HFC365mfc and HFC-245fa emissions are overestimated  while SF6 appears to be under-reported . For HFC-134a, combining current measurements and lifetimes  gives an estimate of 2010 emissions  that is consistent with the RCP range . Without clear guidance on how to correct or place uncertainty on the RCP F-gas emissions, the RCP emissions are reported without uncertainty estimates in Annex II Tables AII.2.4 to AII.2.15. For the very long-lived SF6 and perfluorocarbons  uncertainty in lifetimes does not significantly affect the projected abundances over the 21st century . Projected HFC abundances depend on the changes in tropospheric OH, which determines their atmospheric lifetime . The relative change in hydroxyl radical , as indicated by the projected OH lifetime of CH4 , is used to project HFCs including uncertainties   . Scenarios for the ozone-depleting GHG under control of the Montreal Protocol , HCFCs, halons in AII.4.16) follow scenario A1 of the 2010 WMO Ozone Assessment . All CFC abundances decline throughout the century, but some HCFC abundances increase to 2030 before their phase-out and decline. The summed ERF of all these F-gases is approximately constant  up to year 2040 for all RCPs but declines thereafter. In RCP8.5, the drop in ERF from the Montreal Protocol gases is nearly made up by the growth in HFCs . 11.3.5.1.2 Tropospheric and stratospheric O3 Projected O3 changes are broken into tropospheric and stratospheric columns ; see AII.5.1 and AII.5.2) because each has different driving factors and RF efficiencies . Tropospheric	0
O3 changes are driven by anthropogenic emissions of CH4, NOx, CO, NMVOC . Small changes  are projected over the next few decades. By 2100 tropospheric O3 decreases in RCP2.6, 4.5 and 6.0 but increases in RCP8.5 due to CH4 increases. Higher tropospheric temperatures and humidity drive a decline in tropospheric O3, but stratospheric O3 recovery and increased stratosphere- troposphere exchange can counter that . The latter effect is difficult to quantify but it is included in some of the ACCMIP and CMIP5 models used to project tropospheric O3. Changes in natural emissions of NOx, particularly soil and lightning NOx, and biogenic NMVOC may also alter tropospheric O3 abundances . However, global estimates of their change with climate  remain highly uncertain. Best estimates for projected tropospheric O3 change following the RCP scenarios  are based on ACCMIP time slice simulations for 2030 and 2100 with chemistry-climate models  and the CMIP5 simulations . There is high confidence in these results because similar estimates are obtained when projections are made using the response of tropospheric O3 to key forcing factors that vary across scenarios . The ACCMIP models show a wide range in tropospheric O3 burden changes from 2000 to 2100: -5 DU  in RCP2.6 to +5 DU in RCP8.5. The CMIP5 results are similar but not identical: -3 DU  to +10 DU . The 2030 and 2100 multi-model mean estimates are more robust for ACCMIP which includes 5 to 11 models  than for CMIP5 . Tropospheric O3 changes in the near term  are small , except for RCP8.5 , which shows continued growth through to 2100 driven primarily by CH4 increases. The ERF from tropospheric O3 changes  parallels the O3 burden change . Stratospheric O3 is being driven by declining chlorine levels, changing N2O and CH4, cooler temperatures from increased CO2, and a more vigorous overturning circulation in the stratosphere driven by more wave propagation under climate change . Overall stratospheric O3 is expected to increase in the coming decades, reversing the majority of the loss that occurred between 1980 and 2000. Best estimates for global mean stratospheric O3 change under the RCP scenarios  are taken from the CMIP5 results . By 2100 stratospheric O3 columns show a 5 to 7% increase above 2000 levels for all RCPs, recovering to within 1% of the pre-ozone hole 1980 levels by 2050, but with latitudinal differences. 11.3.5.1.3	0
aerosol optical depth  is primarily of anthropogenic origin . Uniformly, anthropogenic aerosols decrease under RCPs as expected from the declining emissions . From years 2010 to 2030 the aerosol burdens decrease across the RCPs but at varied rates: for sulphate from 6%  to 23% ; for BC from 5%  to 15% , and for OC from 0%  to 11% . The summed aerosol loading of these three anthropogenic components drop from year 2010 to year 2030 by 5% to 12% , and by year 2100 this drop is 24% to 39% . These evolving aerosol loadings reduce the magnitude of the negative aerosol forcing  even in the near term .	0
11.3.5.2 Projections of Air Quality for the 21st Century Future air quality depends on anthropogenic emissions , natural biogenic emissions and the physical climate . This assessment focuses on O3 and PM2.5 in surface air, reflecting the preponderance of published literature and multi-model assessments for these air pollutants  plus the chemistry-climate CMIP5 and ACCMIP model simulations. Nitrogen and acid deposition is addressed in Chapter 6. Toxic atmospheric species such as mercury and persistent organic pollutants are outside this assessment . The global and continental-scale surface O3 and PM2.5 changes assessed here include  the impact of climate change , and  the impact of changing global and regional anthropogenic emissions . Changes in local emissions within a metropolitan region or surrounding air basin on local air quality projections are not assessed here. Anthropogenic emissions of O3 precursors include NOx, CH4, CO, and NMVOC; PM2.5 is both directly emitted  and produced photochemically from precursor emissions  . Recent reviews describe the impact of temperature-driven processes on O3 and PM2.5 air quality from observational and modelling evidence . Projecting future air quality empirically from a mean surface warming using the observed correlation with temperature is problematic, as there is little evidence that future pollution episodes can be simply modelled as all else being equal except for a uniform temperature shift. Air quality relationships with synoptic conditions may be more robust , but require the ability to project changes in key conditions such as blocking and stagnation episodes. The response of blocking frequency to global warming is complex, with summertime increases possible over some regions, but models are generally biased compared to observed blocking statistics, and indicate even larger uncertainty in projecting changes in blocking intensity and persistence . 11.3.5.2.1 Climate-driven changes Projecting regional air quality faces the challenge of simulating first the changes in regional climate and then the feedbacks from atmospheric chemistry and the biosphere. The air pollution response 999	0
to climate-driven changes in the biosphere is uncertain as to sign because of competing effects: for example, plants currently emit more NMVOC with warmer temperatures; with higher CO2 and water stress plants may emit less; with a warmer climate the vegetation types may shift to emit either more or less NMVOC; shifting vegetation types may also alter surface uptake of ozone and aerosols; and our understanding of chemical oxidation pathways for biogenic emissions is incomplete . Although studies have split the cause of air quality changes into climate versus emissions, these attributions are difficult to assess for several reasons: the global-to-regional down-scaling of meteorology that is model dependent , the brief simulations that preclude clear separation of climate change from climate variability , and the lack of systematically explored standard scenarios for local anthropogenic emissions, land use change and biogenic emissions.	0
Ozone Globally, a warming climate decreases baseline surface O3 almost everywhere but increases O3 levels in some polluted regions and seasons. The surface ozone response to climate change alone between 2000 and 2030 is shown in Figure 11.22 , where the ranges reflect multi-model differences in spatial averages  and spatial variability within a single model . There is high confidence that in unpolluted regions, higher water vapour abundances and temperatures enhance O3 destruction, leading to lower baseline O3 levels in a warmer climate . Higher CH4 levels such as in RCP8.5 can offset this climate-driven decrease in baseline O3. Other large-scale factors that could increase baseline O3 in a warming climate include increased lightning NOx and stratospheric influx of O3 . Evidence and agreement are limited regarding the impact of climate change on long-range transport of pollutants . The global chemistry-climate models assessed here  include most of these feedback processes, but a systematic evaluation of their relative impacts is lacking. In polluted regions, observations show that high-O3 episodes correlate with high temperatures , but these episodes also coincide with cloud-free enhanced photochemistry and with air stagnation that concentrates pollution near the surface . Other temperature-related factors, such as biogenic emissions from vegetation and soils, volatilization of NMVOC, thermal decomposition of organic nitrates to NOx and wildfire frequency may increase with a warming climate and are expected to increase surface O3 , Jacob and Winner  and Fiore et al. ), although some of these processes are known to have optimal temperature ranges . Overall, the integrated effect of these processes on O3 remains poorly understood, and they have been implemented with varying levels of complexity in the models assessed here. Models show that a warmer atmosphere can lead to local O3 increases during the peak pollution season (e.g., by 2 to 6 ppb within Cen1000	0
tral Europe by 2030; green dashed line for Europe in Figure 11.22). Regional models projecting summer daytime statistics tend to simulate a wider range of climate-driven changes , with most studies focusing on 2050  or beyond. For example, summer temperature extremes over parts of Europe are projected to warm more than the corresponding mean local temperatures due to enhanced variability at interannual to intraseasonal time scales . Several modelling studies note a longer season for O3 pollution in a warmer world . For some regions, models agree on the sign of the O3 response to a warming climate , but they often disagree ). Several studies have suggested a role for changing synoptic meteorology on future air pollution levels , but projected regional changes in synoptic conditions are uncertain . Observational and modelling evidence together indicate that, all else being equal, a warming climate is expected to increase surface O3 in polluted regions , although a systematic evaluation of all the factors driving extreme pollution episodes is lacking. Aerosols Evaluations as to whether climate change will worsen or improve aerosol pollution are model-dependent. Assessments are confounded by opposing influences on the individual species contributing to total PM2.5 and large interannual variability caused by the small-scale meteorology  that controls aerosol concentrations . For a full discussion, see Chapter 7. Higher temperatures generally decrease nitrate aerosol through enhanced volatility but increase sulphate aerosol through faster production, although observed PM2.5-temperature correlations also reflect humidity and synoptic meteorology . Natural aerosols may increase with temperature, particularly carbonaceous aerosol from wildfires, mineral dust, and biogenic secondary organic aerosol . SOA formation also depends on anthropogenic emissions and atmospheric oxidizing capacity . Aerosols are scavenged from the atmosphere by precipitation and direct deposition . Hence most components of PM2.5 are anti-correlated with precipitation , and aerosol burdens are expected to decrease on average where precipitation increases . However, a shift in the frequency and type of precipitation may be as important as the change in mean precipitation . Seasonal and regional	0

differences in aerosol burdens versus precipitation further preclude a simple scaling of aerosol response to precipitation changes . Climate-driven changes in the frequency of drizzle and the mixing depths or ventilation of the surface layer also influence projected changes in PM2.5 , and aerosols in turn can influence locally clouds, precipitation and scavenging . While PM2.5 is expected to decrease in regions where precipitation increases, the climate variability at these scales results in only low confidence for projections at best. Further, consensus is lacking on the other factors including climate-driven changes in biogenic and mineral dust aerosols, leading to no confidence level being attached to the overall impact of climate change on PM2.5 distributions. 11.3.5.2.2 Changes driven by regional and global anthropogenic pollutant emissions Projections for annual-mean surface O3 and PM2.5 for 2000 through 2100 are shown in Figures 11.23a and 11.25b, respectively. Changes are spatially averaged over selected world  regions and include the combined effects of emission and climate changes under the RCPs. Results are taken from the ACCMIP models and a subset of the CMIP5 models that included atmospheric chemistry. Large interannual variations are evident in the CMIP5 transient simulations, and large regional variations occur in both the CMIP5 and the ACCMIP decadal time slice simulations  for ACCMIP overview).	0
For RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6.0, the CMIP5/ACCMIP models project that continental-scale spatially averaged near-term surface O3 decreases or changes little  from 2000 to 2030 for all regions except South Asia, whereas the long-term change to 2100 is a consistent decrease  for all regions . For RCP8.5, the CMIP5/ACCMIP models project continental-scale spatial average surface O3 increases of up to +5 ppb for both 2030 and 2100 . The increases under RCP8.5 reflect the prominent rise in methane abundances , which by 2100 raise background O3 levels by 5 to 14 ppb over continental-scale regions, and on average by about 8 ppb  above RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 which include more stable methane pathways over the 21st century . Earlier studies have shown that rising CH4 abundances  increase baseline O3, and can offset aggressive local emission reductions and lengthen the O3 pollution season . The O3 changes driven by the RCP emissions scenarios with fixed, present-day climate  are similar to the changes estimated with the full chemistry-climate models . Although the regions considered are not identical, the evidence supports a major role for global emissions in determining nearterm O3 concentrations. Overall, the multi-model ranges associated with the influence of near-term climate change on global and regional O3 air quality are smaller than those across emission scenarios . Aerosol changes driven by anthropogenic emissions depend somewhat on oxidant levels , but generally sulphate follows SO2 emissions and carbonaceous aerosols follow the primary elemental and OC emissions. Competition between sulphate and nitrate for ammonium  means that reducing SO2 emissions while increasing NH3 emissions as in the RCPs  would lead to near-term nitrate aerosol levels equal to or higher than those of sulphate in some regions; see Section 7.3.5.2 . Regional PM2.5 in the CMIP5 and ACCMIP chemistry-climate models following the RCP scenarios generally declines over the 21st century, with little difference across the individual scenarios except for the South and East Asia regions . The noisy projections over Africa, the Middle East and to some extent Australia, reflect dust 1001	0

There is high agreement across numerous modelling studies projecting increases in extreme O3 pollution events over the USA and Europe, but the projections do not consistently agree at the regional level  because they depend on accurate projections of local emissions, regional climate and poorly understood biospheric feedbacks. Although observational evidence clearly demonstrates a strong statistical correlation between extreme temperatures  and pollution events, this temperature correlation reflects in part the coincident occurrence of stagnation events and clear skies that also drive extreme pollution. Mechanistic understanding of biogenic emissions, deposition and atmospheric chemistry is consistent with a temperature-driven increase in pollution extremes in already polluted regions, although these processes may not scale simply with mean temperature under a changing climate , and better projections of the changing meteorology at regional scales are needed. Assuming all else is equal  this collective evidence indicates that uniformly higher temperatures in polluted environments will trigger regional feedbacks during air stagnation episodes that will increase peak pollution .	0
As discussed in Section 11.3.1, most of the projections presented in Sections 11.3.2 to 11.3.4 are based on the RCP4.5 scenario and rely on the spread among the CMIP5 ensemble of opportunity as an ad hoc measure of uncertainty. It is possible that the real world might follow a path outside  the range projected by the CMIP5 models. Such an eventuality could arise if there are processes operating in the real world that are missing from, or inadequately represented in, the models. Two main possibilities must be considered:  Future radiative and other forcings may diverge from the RCP4.5 scenario and, more generally, could fall outside the range of all the RCP scenarios;  The response of the real climate system to radiative and other forcing may differ from that projected by the CMIP5 models. A third possibility is that internal fluctuations in the real climate system are inadequately simulated in the models. The fidelity of the CMIP5 models in simulating internal climate variability is discussed in Chapter 9. Future changes in RF will be caused by anthropogenic and natural processes. The consequences for near-term climate of uncertainties in anthropogenic emissions and land use are discussed in Section 11.3.6.1. The uncertainties in natural RF that are most important for near-term climate are those associated with future volcanic eruptions and variations in the radiation received from the Sun , and are discussed in Section 11.3.6.2. In addition, carbon cycle and other biogeochemical feedbacks in a warming climate could potentially lead to abundances of CO2 and CH4  outside the range of the RCP scenarios, but these feedbacks are not expected to play a major role in near term climate--see Chapters 6 and 12 for further discussion. The response of the climate system to radiative and other forcing is influenced by a very wide range of processes, not all of which are adequately simulated in the CMIP5 models . Of particular 1004	0
concern for projections are mechanisms that could lead to major `surprises' such as an abrupt or rapid change that affects global-to-continental scale climate. Several such mechanisms are discussed in this assessment report; these include: rapid changes in the Arctic , rapid changes in the ocean's overturning circulation , rapid change of ice sheets  and rapid changes in regional monsoon systems and hydrological climate . Additional mechanisms may also exist as synthesized in Chapter 12. These mechanisms have the potential to influence climate in the near term as well as in the long term, albeit the likelihood of substantial impacts increases with global warming and is generally lower for the near term. Section 11.3.6.3 provides an overall assessment of projections for global mean surface air temperature, taking into account all known quantifiable uncertainties.	0
11.3.6.1 Uncertainties in Future Anthropogenic Forcing and the Consequences for Near-term Climate Climate projections for periods prior to year 2050 are not very sensitive to available alternative scenarios for anthropogenic CO2 emissions . Near-term projections, however, may be sensitive to changes in emissions of climate forcing agents with lifetimes shorter than CO2, particularly the GHGs CH4 , tropospheric O3 , and tropospheric aerosols . Although the RCPs and SRES scenarios span a similar range of total effective radiative forcing , they include different ranges of ERF from aerosol, CH4, and tropospheric O3 . From years 2000 to 2030 the change in ERF across the RCPs ranges from -0.05 to +0.14 W m-2 for CH4 and from -0.04 to +0.08 W m-2 for tropospheric O3 . From years 2000 to 2030 the total aerosol ERF becomes less negative, increasing by +0.26 W m-2 for RCP8.5 . Total ERF change across scenarios derived from the CMIP5 ensemble can be compared only beginning in 2010. For the period 2010 to 2030, total ERF in the CMIP5 decadal averages increases by +0.5 to +1.0 W m-2  while total ERF from the published RCPs increases by +0.7 to +1.1 W m-2 . Here we re-examine the near-term temperature increases projected from the RCPs  and assess the potential for changes in near-term anthropogenic forcing to induce climate responses that fall outside these scenarios. For the different RCP pathways the increase in global mean surface temperature by 2026-2035 relative to the reference period 1986-2005 ranges from 0.74C  to 0.94C  . This inter-scenario range of 0.20C is smaller than the inter-model spread for an individual scenario: 0.33C to 0.52C . This RCP inter-scenario spread may be too narrow as discussed in Section 11.3.5.1. The temperature increase of the most rapidly warming scenario  emerges from inter-model spread  by about 2040, due primarily to increasing CH4 and CO2. By 2050 the inter-scenario spread is 0.8C whereas the model spread	0

Increases in 10-year mean  relative to the reference period  of the globally averaged surface air temperatures. Results are shown for the CMIP5 model ensembles  for RCP2.6 , RCP4.5 , RCP6.0 , and RCP8.5  and the CMIP3 model ensemble  for SRES A1b . The multi-model median , 17 to 83% range , 5 to 95% range  across all models are shown for each decade and scenario. Values are provided in Table AII.7.5.

Note that uncertainty remains on how to match the 1986-2005 reference period in observations with that in CMIP5 results. See discussion of Figure 11.25.	0
for each scenario is only 0.6C. At 2040 the ERF in the published RCPs ranges from 2.6  to 3.6  W m-2, and about 40% of this difference is due to the steady increases in CH4 and tropospheric O3 found only in RCP8.5. RCP6.0 has the lowest ERF and thus warms less rapidly than other RCPs up to 2030 . In terms of geographic patterns of warming, differences between RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 are within 0.5C over most of the globe for both summer and winter seasons for 2016-2035 , but by 2036-2055 RCP8.5 is projected to be warmer than RCP2.6 by 0.5C to 1.0C over most continents, and by more than 1.0C over the Arctic in winter. Although studies suggest that the Arctic response is complex and particularly sensitive to BC aerosols , the difference in ERF between RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 is dominated by the GHGs, as the BC atmospheric burden is decreasing through the century with little difference across the RCPs . Large changes in emissions of the well-mixed greenhouse gases  produce only modest changes in the near term because these gases are long lived: For example, a 50% cut in Kyoto-gas emissions beginning in 1990 offsets the warming that otherwise would have occurred by only -0.11C  0.03C after 12 years . In contrast, many studies have noted the large potential for air pollutant emission reductions to influence near-term climate because RF from these species responds almost immediately to changes in emissions. Decreases in sulphate aerosol have occurred through mitigation of both air pollution and fossil-fuel emissions, and are expected to produce a near-term rise in surface temperatures (e.g., Jacobson and	0
Streets, 2009; Raes and Seinfeld, 2009; Wigley et al., 2009; Kloster et al., 2010; Makkonen et al., 2012). Because global mean aerosol forcing decreases in all RCP scenarios , the potential exists for a systematic difference between the CMIP3 models forced with the SRES scenarios and the CMIP5 models forced with the RCP scenarios. One study directly addressed the impacts of aerosols on climate under the RCP4.5 scenario, and found that the aerosol emission reductions induce about a 0.2C warming in the near term compared with fixed 2005 aerosol levels  . The cooling over the period 1951-2010 that is attributed to non-WMGHG anthropogenic forcing in the CMIP5 models  has a likely range of -0.25C  0.35C compared to +0.9C  0.4C for WMGHG. The non-WMGHG forcing generally includes the influence of non-aerosol warming agents over the historical period such as tropospheric ozone, and a simple correction would give an aerosol-only cooling that is about 50% larger in magnitude . The near-term reductions in total aerosol emissions, however, even under the MFR scenario, are at most about 50% , indicating a maximum near-term temperature response of about half that induced by the addition of aerosols over the last century. Hence, the evidence indicates that differences in aerosol loading from the SRES  to the RCP scenarios can increase warming in the CMIP5 models relative to the CMIP3 models by up to 0.2C in the near term for the same WMGHG forcing . Many studies show that air pollutants influence climate and identify approaches to mitigate both air pollution and global warming by 1005	0
decreasing CH4, tropospheric O3 and absorbing aerosols, particularly BC . An alternative set of technologically based scenarios  that examined controls on CH4 and BC emissions designed to reduce tropospheric CH4, O3 and BC also included reductions of co-emitted species . These reductions were applied in two CMIP5 models, and then those model responses were combined with the AR4 best estimates for the range of climate sensitivity and for uncertainty estimates for each component of RF . This approach provided a near-term best estimate and range of global mean temperature change for the reference  and CH4-mitigation  scenarios . Under UNEP-CH4, anthropogenic CH4 emissions decrease by 24% from 2010 to 2030, and global warming is reduced by 0.16C  at 2030 and by 0.28C at 2050. A third UNEP scenario  adds reductions in BC by 78% onto CH4 mitigation and reduces warming by an additional 0.12C  at 2030. However, it greatly increases the uncertainty owing to poor understanding of associated cloud adjustments  as well as of the ratio of BC to co-emitted reflective OC aerosols, their size distributions and mixing states . Corresponding BC reductions in the RCPs are only 4 to 11%. Beyond global mean temperature, shifting magnitudes and geographic patterns of emissions may induce aerosol-specific changes in regional atmospheric circulation and precipitation. See Chapter 7, especially Sections 7.6.2 and 7.6.4, for assessment of this work (Roeckner et al., 2006; Menon and et al., 2008; Ming et al., 2010, 2011; Ott et al., 2010; Randles and Ramaswamy, 2010; Allen and Sherwood, 2011; Bollasina et al., 2011; Leibensperger et al., 2011b;Fyfe et al., 2012; Ganguly et 1006	0
al., 2012; Rotstayn et al., 2012; Shindell et al., 2012b; Teng et al., 2012; Bond et al., 2013). Recent trends in aerosol-fog interactions and snowpack decline are implicated in more rapid regional warming in Europe , and coupling of aerosols and soil moisture could increase near-term local warming in the eastern USA . Major changes in the tropical circulation and rainfall have been attributed to increasing aerosols, but studies often disagree in sign . The lack of standardization  and agreement across studies prevents generalization of these findings to project aerosol-induced changes in regional atmospheric circulation or precipitation in the near term. Land use and land cover change , including deforestation, forest degradation and agricultural expansion for bioenergy , can alter global climate forcing through changing surface albedo , the hydrological cycle, GHGs , or aerosols. The shift from forest to grassland in many places since the pre-industrial era has been formally attributed as a cause of regionally lower mean and extreme temperatures . RCP CO2 and CH4 anthropogenic emissions include land use changes  that vary with the underlying storylines and differ across RCPs. These global-scale changes in crop and pasture land projected over the near term  are smaller in magnitude than the 1950-2000 change  . Overall LULCC has had small impact on ERF  and thus as projected is not a major factor in near-term climate change on global scales. Land use changes can also lead to sustained near-term changes in regional climate through modification of the biogeophysical proper-	0
Although it is possible to detect when various existing volcanoes become more active, or are more likely to erupt, the precise timing of an eruption, the amount of SO2 emitted and its distribution in the stratosphere are not predictable until after the eruption. Eruptions comparable to Mt Pinatubo can be expected to cause a short-term cooling of the climate with related effects on surface climate that persist for a few years before a return to warming trajectories discussed in Section 11.3.2. Larger eruptions, or several eruptions occurring close together in time, would lead to larger and/or more persistent effects.	0
In summary, climate projections for the near term are not very sensitive to the range in anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and other WMGHGs. By the 2040s the CMIP5 median for global mean temperature ranges from a low of +0.9C  to a high of +1.3C  above the CMIP5 reference period . See discussion below regarding possible offsets between the observed and CMIP5 reference periods. Alternative CH4 scenarios incorporating large emission reductions outside the RCP range would offset near-term warming by -0.2C . Aerosols remain a major source of uncertainty in near-term projections, on both global and regional scales. Removal of half of the sulphate aerosol, as projected before 2030 in the MFR scenario and by 2050 in most RCPs, would increase warming by up to +0.2C . Actions to reduce BC aerosol could reduce warming, but the magnitude is highly uncertain, depending on co-emitted  aerosols and aerosol-cloud interactions . In addition, near-term climate change, including extremes and precipitation, may be driven locally by land use change and shifting geographic patterns of aerosols; and these regional climatic effects may exceed those induced by the global ERF.	0
Some of the future CMIP5 climate simulations using the RCP scenarios include an 11-year variation in total solar irradiance  but no underlying trend beyond 2005. Chapter 10 noted that there has been little observed trend in TSI during a time period of rapid global warming since the late 1970s, but that the 11-year solar cycle does introduce a significant and measurable pattern of response in the troposphere . As discussed in Chapter 8 , the Sun has been in a `grand solar maximum' of magnetic activity on the multi-decadal time scale. However, the most recent solar minimum was the lowest and longest since 1920, and some studies  suggest there could be a continued decline towards a much quieter period in the coming decades, but there is low confidence in these projections . Nevertheless, if there is such a reduction in solar activity, there is high confidence that the variations in TSI RF will be much smaller than the projected increased forcing due to GHGs . In addition, studies that have investigated the effect of a possible decline in TSI on future climate have shown that the associated decrease in global mean surface temperature is much smaller than the warming expected from increases in anthropogenic GHGs  However, regional impacts could be more significant .	0
11.3.6.2 Uncertainties in Future Natural Radiative Forcing and the Consequences for Near-term Climate 11.3.6.2.1 The effects of future volcanic eruptions As discussed in Chapters 8 and 10, explosive volcanic eruptions are the major cause of natural variations in RF on interannual to decadal time scales. Most important are large tropical and subtropical eruptions that inject substantial amounts of SO2 directly into the stratosphere. The subsequent formation of sulphate aerosols leads to a negative RF of several watts per metre squared, with a typical lifetime of a year . The eruption of Mt Pinatubo in 1991 was one of the largest in recent times, with a return period of about three times per century, but dwarfed by Tambora in 1815 . Mt Pinatubo caused a rapid drop in a global mean surface air temperature of several tenths of a degree Celsius over the following year, but this signal disappeared over the next five years . In addition to global mean cooling, there are effects on the hydrological cycle , atmosphere and ocean circulation . The surface climate response typically persists for a few years, but the subsurface ocean response can persist for decades or centuries, with consequences for sea level rise .	0
As discussed in Section 8.4.1, a recent satellite measurement  found much greater than expected reduction at ultraviolet  wavelengths in the recent declining solar cycle phase. Changes in solar UV drive stratospheric O3 chemistry and can change RF. Haigh et al.  show that if these observations are correct, they imply the opposite relationship between solar RF and solar activity over that period than has hitherto been assumed. These new measurements therefore increase uncertainty in estimates of the sign of solar RF, but they are not expected to alter estimates of the maximum absolute magnitude of the solar contribution to RF, which remains small . However, they do suggest the possibility of a much larger impact of solar variations on the stratosphere than previously thought, and some studies have suggested that this may lead to significant regional impacts on climate  that are not necessarily reflected by the RF metric . In summary, possible future changes in solar irradiance could influence the rate at which global mean surface air temperature increases, but there is high confidence that this influence will be small in comparison to the influence of increasing concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere. Understanding of the impacts of changes in solar irradiance on continental and sub-continental scale climate remains low. 1007	0
FAQ 11.2 | How Do Volcanic Eruptions Affect Climate and Our Ability to Predict Climate? Large volcanic eruptions affect the climate by injecting sulphur dioxide gas into the upper atmosphere , which reacts with water to form clouds of sulphuric acid droplets. These clouds reflect sunlight back to space, preventing its energy from reaching the Earth's surface, thus cooling it, along with the lower atmosphere. These upper atmospheric sulphuric acid clouds also locally absorb energy from the Sun, the Earth and the lower atmosphere, which heats the upper atmosphere . In terms of surface cooling, the 1991 Mt Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines, for example, injected about 20 million tons of sulphur dioxide  into the stratosphere, cooling the Earth by about 0.5C for up to a year. Globally, eruptions also reduce precipitation, because the reduced incoming shortwave at the surface is compensated by a reduction in latent heating . For the purposes of predicting climate, an eruption causing significant global surface cooling and upper atmospheric heating for the next year or so can be expected. The problem is that, while a volcano that has become more active can be detected, the precise timing of an eruption, or the amount of SO2 injected into the upper atmosphere and how it might disperse cannot be predicted. This is a source of uncertainty in climate predictions. Large volcanic eruptions produce lots of particles, called ash or tephra. However, these particles fall out of the atmosphere quickly, within days or weeks, so they do not affect the global climate. For example, the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption affected surface temperatures in the northwest USA for several days but, because it emitted little SO2 into the stratosphere, it had no detectable global climate impacts. If large, high-latitude eruptions inject sulphur into the stratosphere, they will have an effect only in the hemisphere where they erupted, and the effects will only last a year at most, as the stratospheric cloud they produce only has a lifetime of a few months. Tropical or subtropical volcanoes produce more global surface or tropospheric cooling. This is because the resulting sulphuric acid cloud in the upper atmosphere lasts between one and two years, and can cover much of the globe. However, their regional climatic impacts are difficult to predict, because dispersion of stratospheric sulphate aerosols depends heavily on atmospheric wind conditions at the time of eruption. Furthermore, the surface Decreased upward flux of energy due to absorption by cooling effect is typically not uniform: because contiaerosol cloud and emission nents cool more than the ocean, the summer monsoon at a low temperature can weaken, reducing rain over Asia and Africa.

The largest volcanic eruptions of the past 250 years stimulated scientific study. After the 1783 Laki eruption in Iceland, there were record warm summer temperatures in Europe, followed by a very cold winter. Two large eruptions, an unidentified one in 1809, and the 1815 Tambora eruption caused the `Year Without a Summer' in 1816. Agricultural failures in Europe and the USA that year led to food shortages, famine and riots. The largest eruption in more than 50 years, that of Agung in 1963, led to many modern studies, including observations and climate model calculations. Two subsequent large eruptions, El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991, inspired the work that led to our current understanding of the effects of volcanic eruptions on climate. 	0
Volcanic clouds remain in the stratosphere only for a couple of years, so their impact on climate is correspondingly short. But the impacts of consecutive large eruptions can last longer: for example, at the end of the 13th century there were four large eruptions--one every ten years. The first, in 1258 CE, was the largest in 1000 years. That sequence of eruptions cooled the North Atlantic Ocean and Arctic sea ice. Another period of interest is the three large, and several lesser, volcanic events during 1963-1991 (see Chapter 8 for how these eruptions affected atmospheric composition and reduced shortwave radiation at the ground. Volcanologists can detect when a volcano becomes more active, but they cannot predict whether it will erupt, or if it does, how much sulphur it might inject into the stratosphere. Nevertheless, volcanoes affect the ability to predict climate in three distinct ways. First, if a violent eruption injects significant volumes of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere, this effect can be included in climate predictions. There are substantial challenges and sources of uncertainty involved, such as collecting good observations of the volcanic cloud, and calculating how it will move and change during its lifetime. But, based on observations, and successful modelling of recent eruptions, some of the effects of large eruptions can be included in predictions. The second effect is that volcanic eruptions are a potential source of uncertainty in our predictions. Eruptions cannot be predicted in advance, but they will occur, causing short-term climatic impacts on both local and global scales. In principle, this potential uncertainty can be accounted for by including random eruptions, or eruptions based on some scenario in our near-term ensemble climate predictions. This area of research needs further exploration. The future projections in this report do not include future volcanic eruptions. Third, the historical climate record can be used, along with estimates of observed sulphate aerosols, to test the fidelity of our climate simulations. While the climatic response to explosive volcanic eruptions is a useful analogue for some other climatic forcings, there are limitations. For example, successfully simulating the impact of one eruption can help validate models used for seasonal and interannual predictions. But in this way not all the mechanisms involved in global warming over the next century can be validated, because these involve long term oceanic feedbacks, which have a longer time scale than the response to individual volcanic eruptions.	0
11 11.3.6.3 Synthesis of Near-term Projections of Global Mean Surface Air Temperature Figure 11.25 provides a synthesis of near-term projections of global mean surface air temperature  from CMIP5, CMIP3 and studies that have attempted to use observations to quantify projection uncertainty . On the basis of this evidence, an attempt is made here to assess a likely range for GMST in the period 2016- 2035. Such an overall assessment is not straightforward. The following points must be taken into account: 1. No likelihoods are associated with the different RCP scenarios. For this reason, previous IPCC Assessment Reports have only presented projections that are conditional on specific scenarios. Here we attempt a broader assessment across all four RCP scenarios. This is possible only because, as discussed in Section 11.3.6.1, near-term projections of GMST are not especially sensitive to these different scenarios. 2. In the near term it is expected that increases in GMST will be driven by past and future increases in GHG concentrations and future decreases in anthropogenic aerosols, as found in all the RCP scenarios. Figure 11.25c shows that in the near term the CMIP3 projections based on the SRES scenarios are generally cooler than	0
the CMIP5 projections based on the RCP scenarios. This difference is at least partly attributable to higher aerosol concentrations in the SRES scenarios . 3. The CMIP3 and CMIP5 projections are ensembles of opportunity, and it is explicitly recognized that there are sources of uncertainty not simulated by the models. Evidence of this can be seen by comparing the Rowlands et al.  projections for the A1B scenario, which were obtained using a very large ensemble in which the physics parameterizations were perturbed in a single climate model, with the corresponding raw multi-model CMIP3 projections. The former exhibit a substantially larger likely range than the latter. A pragmatic approach to addressing this issue, which was used in the AR4 and is also used in Chapter 12, is to consider the 5 to 95% CMIP3/5 range as a `likely' rather than `very likely' range. 4. As discussed in Section 11.3.6.2, the RCP scenarios assume no underlying trend in total solar irradiance and no future volcanic eruptions. Future volcanic eruptions cannot be predicted and there is low confidence in projected changes in solar irradiance . Consequently the possible effects of future changes in natural forcings are excluded from the assessment here.	0
5. As discussed in Section 11.3.2.1.1 observationally constrained `ASK' projections  are 10 to 15% cooler , and have a narrower range, than the corresponding `raw'  CMIP5 projections. The reduced rate of warming in the ASK projections is related to evidence from Chapter 10  that `some CMIP5 models have a higher transient response to GHGs and a larger response to other anthropogenic forcings  than the real world .' These models may warm too rapidly as GHGs increase and aerosols decline. 6. Over the last two decades the observed rate of increase in GMST has been at the lower end of rates simulated by CMIP5 models . This hiatus in GMST rise is discussed in detail in Box 9.2 , where it is concluded that the hiatus is attributable, in roughly equal measure, to a decline in the rate of increase in ERF and a cooling contribution from internal variability . The decline in the rate of increase in ERF is attributed primarily to natural  forcing but there is low confidence in quantifying the role of forcing trend in causing the hiatus, because of uncertainty in the magnitude of the volcanic forcing trend and low confidence in the aerosol forcing trend. Concerning the higher rate of warming in CMIP5 simulations it is concluded that there is a substantial contribution from internal variability but that errors in ERF and in model responses may also contribute. There is low confidence in this assessment because of uncertainties in aerosol forcing in particular.	0
rapidly in the near term than occurred over the hiatus period , which is consistent with more rapid warming. In addition, Box 9.2 includes an assessment that internal variability is more likely than not to make a positive contribution to the increase in GMST in the near term. Internal variability is included in the CMIP5 projections, but because most of the CMIP5 simulations do not reproduce the observed reduction in global mean surface warming over the last 10 to 15 years, the distribution of CMIP5 near-term trends will not reflect this assessment and might, as a result, be biased low. This uncertainty, however, is somewhat counter balanced by the evidence of point 5, which suggests a high bias in the distribution of near-term trends. A further projection of GMST for the period 2016-2035 may be obtained by starting from the observed GMST for 2012  and projecting increases at rates between the 5 to 95% CMIP5 range of 0.11C to 0.41C per decade. The resulting range of 0.29C to 0.69C, relative to 1986-2005, is shown on Figure 11.25.	0
The observed hiatus has important implications for near-term projections of GMST. A basic issue concerns the sensitivity of projections to the choice of reference period. Figure 11.25b and c shows the 5 to 95% ranges for CMIP5 projections using a 1986-2005 reference period , and the same projections using a 2006-2012 reference period . The latter projections are cooler, and the effect of using a more recent reference period appears similar to the effect of initialization . Using this more recent reference period, the 5 to 95% range for the mean GMST in 2016-2035 relative to 1986-2005 is 0.36C to 0.79C - of 0.16C). This range may be compared with the range of 0.48C to 1.15C obtained from the CMIP5 models using the original 1986-2005 reference period.	0
Overall, in the absence of major volcanic eruptions--which would cause significant but temporary cooling--and, assuming no significant future long term changes in solar irradiance, it is likely  that the GMST anomaly for the period 2016-2035, relative to the reference period of 1986-2005 will be in the range 0.3C to 0.7C . This range is consistent, to one significant figure, with the range obtained by using CMIP5 5 to 95% model trends for 2012-2035. It is also consistent with the CMIP5 5 to 95% range for all four RCP scenarios of 0.36C to 0.79C, using the 2006-2012 reference period, after the upper and lower bounds are reduced by 10% to take into account the evidence noted under point 5 that some models may be too sensitive to anthropogenic forcing. The 0.3C to 0.7C range includes the likely range of the ASK projections and initialized predictions for RCP4.5. It corresponds to a rate of change of GMST between 2012 and 2035 in the range 0.12C to 0.42C per decade. The higher rates of change can be associated with a significant positive contribution from internal variability  and/or high rates of increase in ERF . Note that an upper limit of 0.8C on the 2016-2035 GMST corresponds to a rate of change over the period 2012-2035 of 0.49C per decade, which is considered unlikely. The assessed rates of change are consistent with the AR4 SPM statement that `For the next two decades, a warming of about 0.2C per decade is projected for a range of SRES emission scenarios'. However, the implied rates of warming over the period from 1986-2005 to 2016-2035 are lower as a result of the hiatus: 0.10C to 0.23C per decade, suggesting the AR4 assessment was near the upper end of current expectations for this specific time interval.	0
7. In view of the sensitivity of projections to the reference period it is helpful to consider the possible rate of change of GMST in the near term. The CMIP5 5 to 95% ranges for GMST trends in the period 2012-2035 are 0.11C to 0.41C per decade. This range is similar to, though slightly narrower than, the range found by Easterling and Wehner  for the CMIP3 SRES A2 scenario over the longer period 2000-2050. It may also be compared with recent rates in the observational record . The RCP scenarios project that ERF will increase more	0
The assessment here provides only a likely range for GMST. Possible reasons why the real world might depart from this range include: RF departs significantly from the RCP scenarios, due to either natural  or anthropogenic  causes; processes that are poorly simulated in the CMIP5 models exert a significant influence on GMST. The latter class includes: a possible strong `recovery' from the recent hiatus in GMST; the possibility that models might underestimate decadal variability ; the possibility that model sensitivity to anthropogenic forcing may differ from that of the real world (see point	0

Table 11.3 | Percentage of CMIP5 models for which the projected change in global mean surface air temperature, relative to 1850-1900, crosses the specified temperature levels, by the specified time periods and assuming the specified RCP scenarios. The projected temperature change relative to the mean temperature in the period 1850-1900 is calculated using the models' projected temperature change relative to 1986-2005 plus the observed temperature change between 1850-1900 and 1986-2005 of 0.61C estimated from the Hadley Centre/Climate Research Unit gridded surface temperature data set 4 . The percentages in brackets use an alternative reference period for the model projections of 2006-2012, together with the observed temperature difference between 1986-2005 and 2006-2012 of 0.16C. The definition of crossing is that the 20-year mean exceeds the specified temperature level. Note that these percentages should not be interpreted as likelihoods because there are other sources of uncertainty .	0
5); and the possibility of abrupt changes in climate . The assessment here has focused on 20-year mean values of GMST for the period 2016-2035. There is no unique method to derive a likely range for annual mean values from the range for 20-year means, so such calculations necessarily involve additional uncertainties , and lower confidence. Nevertheless, it is useful to attempt to estimate a range for annual mean values, which may be compared with raw model projections and, in the future, with observations. To do so, the following simple approach is used:  Starting in 2009 from the observed GMST anomaly for 2006-2012 of 0.16C , linear trends are projected over the period 2009-2035 with maximum and minimum gradients selected to be consistent with the 0.3C to 0.7C range for the mean GMST in the period 2016-2035; 2). To take into account the expected year-to-year variability of annual mean values, the resulting linear trends are offset by 0.1C. The value of 0.1C is based on the standard deviation of annual means in CMIP5 control runs . These calculations provide an indicative likely range for 1012	0
annual mean GMST, which is shown as the red hatched area in Figure 11.25b. Note that this range does not take into account the expected impact of any future volcanic eruptions. The assessed likely range for GMST in the period 2016-2035 may also be used to assess the likelihood that GMST will cross policy-relevant levels, relative to earlier time periods . Using the 1850-1900 period, and the observed temperature rise between 1850- 1900 and 1986-2005 of 0.61C  gives a likely range for the GMST anomaly in 2016-2035 of 0.91C-1.31C, and supports the following conclusions: it is more likely than not that the mean GMST for the period 2016-2035 will be more than 1C above the mean for 1850-1900, and very unlikely that it will be more than 1.5C above the 1850-1900 mean . Additional information about the possibility of GMST crossing specific temperature levels is provided in Table 11.3, which shows the percentage of CMIP5 models for which the projected change in GMST exceeds specific temperature levels, under each RCP scenario, in two time periods , and also using the two different reference periods discussed under point 6 and illustrated in Figure 11.25. However, these percentages should not be interpreted as likelihoods because--as discussed in this section--there are sources of uncertainty not captured by the CMIP5 ensemble. Note finally that it is very likely that specific temperature levels will be crossed temporarily in individual years before a permanent crossing is established , but Table 11.3 is based on 20-year mean values.	0
Box 11.2 | Ability of Climate Models to Simulate Observed Regional Trends The ability of models to simulate past climate change on regional scales can be used to investigate whether the multi-model ensemble spread covers the forcing and model uncertainties. Agreement between observed and simulated regional trends, taking natural variability and model spread into account, would build confidence in near-term projections. Although large-scale features are simulated well , on sub-continental and smaller scales the observed trends are, in general, more often in the tails of the distribution of modelled trends than would be expected by chance fluctuations . Natural variability and model spread are larger at smaller scales , but this is not enough to bridge the gap between models and observations. Downscaling with Regional Climate Models  does not affect seasonal mean trends except near mountains or coastlines in Europe . These results hold for both observed and modelled estimates of natural variability and for various analyses of the observations. Given the statistical nature of the comparisons, it is currently not possible to say in which regions observed discrepancies are due to coincidental natural variability and in which regions they are due to forcing or model deficiencies. These results show that in general the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  ensemble cannot be taken as a reliable regional probability forecast, but that the true uncertainty can be larger than the model spread indicated in the maps in this chapter and Annex I. Temperature Raisanen  and Yokohata et al.  compared regional linear temperature trends during 1955-2005  with corresponding trends in the CMIP3 ensemble. They found that the range of simulated trends captured the observed trend in nearly all locations. Using another metric, Knutson et al.,  found that CMIP5 models did slightly better than CMIP3 in reproducing linear trends . The linear CMIP5 temperature trends are compared with the observed trends in Box 11.2, Figure 1a-h. The rank histograms show the warm bias in global mean temperature  and some overconfidence, but within the inter-model spread. However, the apparent agreement appears to be for the wrong reason. Many of the models that appear to correctly simulate observed high regional trends do so because they have a high climate response  and do not simulate the observed spatial pattern of trends . To address this, Bhend and Whetton  and van Oldenborgh et al.  use another definition of the local trend: the regression of the local temperature on the  global mean temperature. This definition separates the local temperature response pattern from the global mean climate response. They find highly significant discrepancies between the CMIP3 and CMIP5 trend patterns and a variety of estimates of observed trend estimates. These discrepancies are defined relative to an error model that includes the  natural variability, model spread and spatial autocorrelations. In the following, areas where the observed and modelled trends show marked differences are noted. Areas of agreement are covered in Section 10.3.1.1.4. In December to February the observed Arctic amplification extends further south than modelled in Central Asia and northwestern North America. In June to August southern Europe and North Africa have warmed significantly faster than both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models simulated ; this also holds for the Middle East. The observed Indo-Pacific warm pool trend is significantly higher than the modelled trend year-round , and the North Pacific and the southeastern USA and adjoining ocean trends were lower. Direct causes for many of these discrepancies are known  or teleconnections from other areas with trend biases , but the causes of the underlying discrepancies are often unknown. Possibilities include observational uncertainties , an underestimation of the low-frequency variability  show evidence that this is probably not the case for temperature outside the tropics), unrealistic local forcing ), or missing or misrepresented processes in models ). Precipitation In spite of the larger variability relative to the trends and observational uncertainties , annual mean regional linear precipitation trends have been found to differ significantly between observations and CMIP3 models, both in the zonal mean  and regionally . The comparison is shown in Box 11.2, Figure 1i-p for the CMIP5 half-year seasons used in Annex I, following van Oldenborgh et al. . In both half years the observations fall more often in the highest and lowest 5% than expected by chance fluctuations within the ensemble . The differences larger than the difference between the CRU and GPCC analyses  are noted below. 	0
In Europe there are large-scale differences between observed trends and trends, both in General Circulation Models  and RCMs , which are ascribed to circulation change discrepancies in winter and in summer sea surface temperature  trend biases  and the misrepresentation of Summer North Atlantic Oscillation  teleconnections . Central North America has become much wetter over 1950-2012, especially in winter, which is not simulated by the CMIP5 models. Larger observed northwest Australian rainfall increases than in CMIP3 in summer are driven by ozone forcings in two climate models  and aerosols in another . The Guinea Coast has become drier in the observations than in the models. The CMIP5 patterns seem to reproduce the observed patterns somewhat better than the CMIP3 patterns , but the remaining discrepancies imply that CMIP5 projections cannot be used as reliable precipitation forecasts.	0
Scenarios, Ensembles and Uncertainties The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  presents an unprecedented level of information on which to base projections including new Earth System Models with a more complete representation of forcings, new Representative Concentration Pathways  scenarios and more output available for analysis. The four RCP scenarios used in CMIP5 lead to a total radiative forcing  at 2100 that spans a wider range than that estimated for the three Special Report on Emission Scenarios  scenarios  used in the Fourth Assessment Report , RCP2.6 being almost 2 W m-2 lower than SRES B1 by 2100. The magnitude of future aerosol forcing decreases more rapidly in RCP scenarios, reaching lower values than in SRES scenarios through the 21st century. Carbon dioxide  represents about 80 to 90% of the total anthropogenic forcing in all RCP scenarios through the 21st century. The ensemble mean total effective RFs at 2100 for CMIP5 concentration-driven projections are 2.2, 3.8, 4.8 and 7.6 W m-2 for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 respectively, relative to about 1850, and are close to corresponding Integrated Assessment Model -based estimates . 	0
Temperature change will not be regionally uniform. There is very high confidence2 that globally averaged changes over land will exceed changes over the ocean at the end of the 21st century by a factor that is likely in the range 1.4 to 1.7. In the absence of a strong reduction in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning, the Arctic region is projected to warm most . This polar amplification is not found in Antarctic regions due to deep ocean mixing, ocean heat uptake and the persistence of the Antarctic ice sheet. Projected regional surface air temperature increase has minima in the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans in all scenarios. One model exhibits marked cooling in 2081-2100 over large parts of the Northern Hemisphere , and a few models indicate slight cooling locally in the North Atlantic. Atmospheric zonal mean temperatures show warming throughout the troposphere, especially in the upper troposphere and northern high latitudes, and cooling in the stratosphere. It is virtually certain that, in most places, there will be more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes as global mean temperatures increase. These changes are expected for events defined as extremes on both daily and seasonal time scales. Increases in the frequency, duration and magnitude of hot extremes along with heat stress are expected; however, occasional cold winter extremes will continue to occur. Twenty-year return values of low temperature events are projected to increase at a rate greater than winter mean temperatures in most regions, with the largest changes in the return values of low temperatures at high latitudes. Twenty-year return values for high temperature events are projected to increase at a rate similar to or greater than the rate of increase of summer mean temperatures in most regions. Under RCP8.5 it is likely that, in most land regions, a current 20-year high temperature event will occur more frequently by the end of the 21st	0
Mean sea level pressure is projected to decrease in high latitudes and increase in the mid-latitudes as global temperatures rise. In the tropics, the Hadley and Walker Circulations are likely to slow down. Poleward shifts in the mid-latitude jets of about 1 to 2 degrees latitude are likely at the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 in both hemispheres , with weaker shifts in the NH. In austral summer, the additional influence of stratospheric ozone recovery in the Southern Hemisphere opposes changes due to GHGs there, though the net response varies strongly across models and scenarios. Substantial uncertainty and thus low confidence remains in projecting changes in NH storm tracks, especially for the North Atlantic basin. The Hadley Cell is likely to widen, which translates to broader tropical regions and a poleward encroachment of subtropical dry zones. In the stratosphere, the Brewer-Dobson circulation is likely to strengthen. 	0
Annual surface evaporation is projected to increase as global temperatures rise over most of the ocean and is projected to change over land following a similar pattern as precipitation. Decreases in annual runoff are likely in parts of southern Europe, the Middle East, and southern Africa by the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Increases in annual runoff are likely in the high northern latitudes corresponding to large increases in winter and spring precipitation by the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Regional to global-scale projected decreases in soil moisture and increased risk of agricultural drought are likely in presently dry regions and are projected with medium confidence by the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Prominent areas of projected decreases in evaporation include southern Africa and north western Africa along the Mediterranean. Soil moisture drying in the Mediterranean, southwest USA and southern African regions is consistent with projected changes in Hadley Circulation and increased surface temperatures, so surface drying in these regions as global temperatures increase is likely with high confidence by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. In regions where surface moistening is projected, changes are generally smaller than natural variability on the 20-year time scale. 	0
It is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue shrinking and thinning year-round in the course of the 21st century as global mean surface temperature rises. At the same time, in the Antarctic, a decrease in sea ice extent and volume is expected, but with low confidence. Based on the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble, projections of average reductions in Arctic sea ice extent for 2081- 2100 compared to 1986-2005 range from 8% for RCP2.6 to 34% for RCP8.5 in February and from 43% for RCP2.6 to 94% for RCP8.5 in September . A nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean  in September before mid-century is likely under RCP8.5 , based on an assessment of a subset of models that most closely reproduce the climatological mean state and 1979-2012 trend of the Arctic sea ice cover. Some climate projections exhibit 5- to 10-year periods of sharp summer Arctic sea ice decline--even steeper than observed over the last decade--and it is likely that such instances of rapid ice loss will occur in the future. There is little evidence in global climate models of a tipping point  in the transition from a perennially ice-covered to a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean beyond which further sea ice loss is unstoppable and irreversible. In the Antarctic, the CMIP5 multi-model mean projects a decrease in sea ice extent that ranges from 16% for RCP2.6 to 67% for RCP8.5 in February and from 8% for RCP2.6 to 30% for RCP8.5 in September for 2081-2100 compared to 1986-2005. There is, however, low confidence in those values as projections because of the wide inter-model spread and the inability of almost all of the available models to reproduce the mean annual cycle, interannual variability and overall increase of the Antarctic sea ice areal coverage observed during the satellite era. 	0
Changes in average precipitation in a warmer world will exhibit substantial spatial variation. Some regions will experience increases, other regions will experience decreases and yet others will not experience significant changes at all. There is high confidence that the contrast of annual mean precipitation between dry and wet regions and that the contrast between wet and dry seasons will increase over most of the globe as temperatures increase. The general pattern of change indicates that high latitude land masses are likely to experience greater amounts of precipitation due to the increased specific humidity of the warmer troposphere as well as increased transport of water vapour from the tropics by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Many mid-latitude and subtropical arid and semi-arid regions will likely experience less precipitation and many moist mid-latitude regions will likely experience more precipitation by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Globally, for short-duration precipitation events, a shift to more intense individual storms and fewer weak storms is likely as temperatures increase. Over most of the mid-latitude land-masses and over wet tropical regions, extreme precipitation events will very likely be more intense and more frequent in a warmer world. The global average sensitivity of the 20-year return value of the annual maximum daily precipitation increases ranges from 4% C-1 of local temperature increase  to 5.3% oC-1 of local temperature increase  but regionally there are wide variations. 1032	0
cover changes result from precipitation and ablation changes, which are sometimes opposite. Projections of the NH spring snow covered area by the end of the 21st century vary between a decrease of 7%  and a decrease of 25% , with a pattern that is fairly consistent between models. The projected changes in permafrost are a response not only to warming but also to changes in snow cover, which exerts a control on the underlying soil. By the end of the 21st century, diagnosed near-surface permafrost area is projected to decrease by between 37%  and 81%  . 	0
The global ocean will warm in all RCP scenarios. The strongest ocean warming is projected for the surface in subtropical and tropical regions. At greater depth the warming is projected to be most pronounced in the Southern Ocean. Best estimates of ocean warming in the top one hundred meters are about 0.6C  to 2.0C , and about 0.3C  to 0.6C  at a depth of about 1 km by the end of the 21st century. For RCP4.5 by the end of the 21st century, half of the energy taken up by the ocean is in the uppermost 700 m and 85% is in the uppermost 2000 m. Due to the long time scales of this heat transfer from the surface to depth, ocean warming will continue for centuries, even if GHG emissions are decreased or concentrations kept constant. 	0
Long-term Climate Change, Commitment and Irreversibility Global temperature equilibrium would be reached only after centuries to millennia if RF were stabilized. Continuing GHG emissions beyond 2100, as in the RCP8.5 extension, induces a total RF above 12 W m-2 by 2300. Sustained negative emissions beyond 2100, as in RCP2.6, induce a total RF below 2 W m-2 by 2300. The projected warming for 2281-2300, relative to 1986-2005, is 0.0C to 1.2C for RCP2.6 and 3.0C to 12.6C for RCP8.5 . In much the same way as the warming to a rapid increase of forcing is delayed, the cooling after a decrease of RF is also delayed. A large fraction of climate change is largely irreversible on human time scales, unless net anthropogenic CO2 emissions were strongly negative over a sustained period. For scenarios	0
Climate Stabilization The principal driver of long-term warming is total emissions of CO2 and the two quantities are approximately linearly related. The global mean warming per 1000 PgC ) is likely between 0.8C to 2.5C per 1000 PgC, for cumulative emissions less than about 2000 PgC until the time at which temperatures peak. To limit the warming caused by anthropogenic CO2 emissions alone to be likely less than 2C relative to the period 1861-1880, total CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources would need to be limited to a cumulative budget of about 1000 PgC since that period. About half  of this budget was already emitted by 2011. Accounting for projected warming effect of non-CO2 forcing, a possible release of GHGs from permafrost or methane hydrates, or requiring a higher likelihood of temperatures remaining below 2C, all imply a lower budget. 	0
Projections of future climate change are not like weather forecasts. It is not possible to make deterministic, definitive predictions of how climate will evolve over the next century and beyond as it is with shortterm weather forecasts. It is not even possible to make projections of the frequency of occurrence of all possible outcomes in the way that it might be possible with a calibrated probabilistic medium-range weather forecast. Projections of climate change are uncertain, first because they are dependent primarily on scenarios of future anthropogenic and natural forcings that are uncertain, second because of incomplete understanding and imprecise models of the climate system and finally because of the existence of internal climate variability. The term climate projection tacitly implies these uncertainties and dependencies. Nevertheless, as greenhouse gas  concentrations continue to rise, we expect to see future changes to the climate system that are greater than those already observed and attributed to human activities. It is possible to understand future climate change using models and to use models to characterize outcomes and uncertainties under specific assumptions about future forcing scenarios. This chapter assesses climate projections on time scales beyond those covered in Chapter 11, that is, beyond the mid-21st century. Information from a range of different modelling tools is used here; from simple energy balance models, through Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity  to complex dynamical climate and Earth System Models . These tools are evaluated in Chapter 9 and, where possible, the evaluation is used in assessing the validity of the projections. This chapter also summarizes some of the information on leading-order measures of the sensitivity of the climate system from other chapters and discusses the relevance of these measures for climate projections, commitments and irreversibility. Since the AR4  there have been a number of advances: *	0
New scenarios of future forcings have been developed to replace the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios . The Representative Concentration Pathways  , have been designed to cover a wide range of possible magnitudes of climate change in models rather than being derived sequentially from storylines of socioeconomic futures. The aim is to provide a range of climate responses while individual socioeconomic scenarios may be derived, scaled and interpolated . Nevertheless, many studies that have been performed since AR4 have used SRES and, where appropriate, these are assessed. Simplified scenarios of future change, developed strictly for understanding the response of the climate system rather than to represent realistic future outcomes, are also synthesized and the understanding of leading-order measures of climate response such as the equilibrium climate sensitivity  and the transient climate response  are assessed. New models have been developed with higher spatial resolution, with better representation of processes and with the inclusion of more processes, in particular processes that are important in simulating the carbon cycle of the Earth. In these models, emissions of	0
Techniques to assess and quantify uncertainties in projections have been further developed but a full probabilistic quantification remains difficult to propose for most quantities, the exception being global, temperature-related measures of the system sensitivity to forcings, such as ECS and TCR. In those few cases, projections are presented in the form of probability density functions . We make the distinction between the spread of a multi-model ensemble, an ad hoc measure of the possible range of projections and the quantification of uncertainty that combines information from models and observations using statistical algorithms. Just like climate models, different techniques for quantifying uncertainty exist and produce different outcomes. Where possible, different estimates of uncertainty are compared.	0
Although not an advance, as time has moved on, the baseline period from which climate change is expressed has also moved on . Hence climate change is expressed as a change with respect to a recent period of history, rather than a time before significant anthropogenic influence. It should be borne in mind that some anthropogenically forced climate change had already occurred by the 1986-2005 period . The focus of this chapter is on global and continental/ocean basin-scale features of climate. For many aspects of future climate change, it is possible to discuss generic features of projections and the processes that underpin them for such large scales. Where interesting or unique changes have been investigated at smaller scales, and there is a level of agreement between different studies of those smaller-scale changes, these may also be assessed in this chapter, although where changes are linked to climate phenomena such as El Nino, readers are referred to Chapter 14. Projections of atmospheric composition, chemistry and air quality for the 21st century are assessed in Chapter 11, except for CO2 which is assessed in this chapter. An innovation for AR5 is Annex I: Atlas of Global and Regional Climate Projections, a collection of global and regional maps of projected climate changes derived from model output. A detailed commentary on each of the maps presented in Annex I is not provided here, but some discussion of generic features is provided. Projections from regional models driven by boundary conditions from global models are not extensively assessed but may be mentioned in this chapter. More detailed regional information may be found in Chapter 14 and is also now assessed in the Working Group II report, where it can more easily be linked to impacts.	0
Many of the figures presented in this chapter and in others draw on data collected as part of CMIP5 . The project involves the worldwide coordination of ESM experiments including the coordination of input forcing fields, diagnostic output and the hosting of data in a distributed archive. CMIP5 has been unprecedented in terms of the number of modelling groups and models participating, the number of experiments performed and the number of diagnostics collected. The archive of model simulations began being populated by mid-2011 and continued to grow during the writing of AR5. The production of figures for this chapter draws on a fixed database of simulations and variables that was available on 15 March 2013 . Different figures may use different subsets of models and there are unequal numbers of models that have produced output for the different RCP scenarios. Figure 12.1 gives a summary of which output was available from which model for which scenario. Where multiple runs	0
are performed with exactly the same model but with different initial conditions, we choose only one ensemble member  in order not to weight models with more ensemble members than others unduly in the m  ulti-model synthesis. Rather than give an exhaustive account of which models were used to make which figures, this summary information is presented as a guide to readers. In addition to output from CMIP5, information from a coordinated set of simulations with EMICs is also used  to investigate long-term climate change beyond 2100. Even more simplified energy balance models or emulation techniques are also used, mostly to estimate responses where ESM experiments are not available . An evaluation of the models used for projections is provided in Chapter 9 of this Report.	0
FAQ 12.1 | Why Are So Many Models and Scenarios Used to Project Climate Change? Future climate is partly determined by the magnitude of future emissions of greenhouse gases, aerosols and other natural and man-made forcings. These forcings are external to the climate system, but modify how it behaves. Future climate is shaped by the Earth's response to those forcings, along with internal variability inherent in the climate system. A range of assumptions about the magnitude and pace of future emissions helps scientists develop different emission scenarios, upon which climate model projections are based. Different climate models, meanwhile, provide alternative representations of the Earth's response to those forcings, and of natural climate variability. Together, ensembles of models, simulating the response to a range of different scenarios, map out a range of possible futures, and help us understand their uncertainties. Predicting socioeconomic development is arguably even more difficult than predicting the evolution of a physical system. It entails predicting human behaviour, policy choices, technological advances, international competition and cooperation. The common approach is to use scenarios of plausible future socioeconomic development, from which future emissions of greenhouse gases and other forcing agents are derived. It has not, in general, been possible to assign likelihoods to individual forcing scenarios. Rather, a set of alternatives is used to span a range of possibilities. The outcomes from different forcing scenarios provide policymakers with alternatives and a range of possible futures to consider. Internal fluctuations in climate are spontaneously generated by interactions between components such as the atmosphere and the ocean. In the case of near-term climate change, they may eclipse the effect of external perturbations, like greenhouse gas increases . Over the longer term, however, the effect of external forcings is expected to dominate instead. Climate model simulations project that, after a few decades, different scenarios of future anthropogenic greenhouse gases and other forcing agents--and the climate system's response to them--will differently affect the change in mean global temperature . Therefore, evaluating the consequences of those various scenarios and responses is of paramount importance, especially when policy decisions are considered. Climate models are built on the basis of the physical principles governing our climate system, and empirical understanding, and represent the complex, interacting processes needed to simulate climate and climate change, both past and future. Analogues from past observations, or extrapolations from recent trends, are inadequate strategies for producing projections, because the future will not necessarily be a simple continuation of what we have seen thus far. Although it is possible to write down the equations of fluid motion that determine the behaviour of the atmosphere and ocean, it is impossible to solve them without using numerical algorithms through computer model simulation, similarly to how aircraft engineering relies on numerical simulations of similar types of equations. Also, many small-scale physical, biological and chemical processes, such as cloud processes, cannot be described by those equations, either because we lack the computational ability to describe the system at a fine enough resolution to directly simulate these processes or because we still have a partial scientific understanding of the mechanisms driving these processes. Those need instead to be approximated by so-called parameterizations within the climate models, through which a mathematical relation between directly simulated and approximated quantities is established, often on the basis of observed behaviour.	0
There are various alternative and equally plausible numerical representations, solutions and approximations for modelling the climate system, given the limitations in computing and observations. This diversity is considered a healthy aspect of the climate modelling community, and results in a range of plausible climate change projections at global and regional scales. This range provides a basis for quantifying uncertainty in the projections, but because the number of models is relatively small, and the contribution of model output to public archives is voluntary, the sampling of possible futures is neither systematic nor comprehensive. Also, some inadequacies persist that are common to all models; different models have different strength and weaknesses; it is not yet clear which aspects of the quality of the simulations that can be evaluated through observations should guide our evaluation of future model simulations. 	0
Models of varying complexity are commonly used for different projection problems. A faster model with lower resolution, or a simplified description of some climate processes, may be used in cases where long multi-century simulations are required, or where multiple realizations are needed. Simplified models can adequately represent large-scale average quantities, like global average temperature, but finer details, like regional precipitation, can be simulated only by complex models. The coordination of model experiments and output by groups such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project , the World Climate Research Program and its Working Group on Climate Models has seen the science community step up efforts to evaluate the ability of models to simulate past and current climate and to compare future climate change projections. The `multi-model' approach is now a standard technique used by the climate science community to assess projections of a specific climate variable. FAQ 12.1, Figure 1, right panels, shows the temperature response by the end of the 21st century for two illustrative models and the highest and lowest RCP scenarios. Models agree on large-scale patterns of warming at the surface, for example, that the land is going to warm faster than ocean, and the Arctic will warm faster than the tropics. But they differ both in the magnitude of their global response for the same scenario, and in small scale, regional aspects of their response. The magnitude of Arctic amplification, for instance, varies among different models, and a subset of models show a weaker warming or slight cooling in the North Atlantic as a result of the reduction in deepwater formation and shifts in ocean currents. There are inevitable uncertainties in future external forcings, and the climate system's response to them, which are further complicated by internally generated variability. The use of multiple scenarios and models have become a standard choice in order to assess and characterize them, thus allowing us to describe a wide range of possible future evolutions of the Earth's climate.	0
FAQ 12.1, Figure 1 | Global mean temperature change averaged across all Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5  models  for the four Representative Concentration Pathway  scenarios: RCP2.6 , RCP4.5 , RCP6.0  and RCP8.5 ; 32, 42, 25 and 39 models were used respectively for these 4 scenarios. Likely ranges for global temperature change by the end of the 21st century are indicated by vertical bars. Note that these ranges apply to the difference between two 20-year means, 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005, which accounts for the bars being centred at a smaller value than the end point of the annual trajectories. For the highest  and lowest  scenario, illustrative maps of surface temperature change at the end of the 21st century  are shown for two CMIP5 models. These models are chosen to show a rather broad range of response, but this particular set is not representative of any measure of model response uncertainty.	0
qualitative and even more so quantitative, involves much more than a measure of the range of model outcomes, because additional sources of information  lead us to expect that the uncertainty around the future climate state does not coincide straightforwardly with those ranges. In fact, in this chapter we highlight wherever relevant the distinction between model uncertainty evaluation, which encompasses the understanding that models have intrinsic shortcoming in fully and accurately representing the real system, and cannot all be considered independent of one another , and a simpler descriptive quantification, based on the range of outcomes from the ensemble of models. Uncertainty affecting mid- to long-term projections of climatic changes stems from distinct but possibly interacting sources. Figure 12.2 shows a schematic of the chain from scenarios, through ESMs to projections. Uncertainties affecting near-term projections of which some aspect are also relevant for longer-term projections are discussed in Section 11.3.1.1 and shown in Figure 11.8. Future anthropogenic emissions of GHGs, aerosol particles and other forcing agents such as land use change are dependent on socioeconomic factors including global geopolitical agreements to control those emissions. Systematic studies that attempt to quantify the likely ranges of anthropogenic emission have been undertaken  but it is more common to use a scenario approach of different but plausible--in the sense of technically feasible--pathways, leading to the concept of scenario uncertainty.

use of the SRES scenarios  developed using a sequential approach, that is, socioeconomic factors feed into emissions scenarios which are then used either to directly force the climate models or to determine concentrations of GHGs and other agents required to drive these models. This report also assesses outcomes of simulations that use the new RCP scenarios, developed using a parallel process  whereby different targets in terms of RF at 2100 were selected  and GHG and aerosol emissions consistent with those targets, and their corresponding socioeconomic drivers were developed simultaneously . Rather than being identified with one socioeconomic storyline, RCP scenarios are consistent with many possible economic futures . Their development was driven by the need to produce scenarios that could be input to climate model simulations more expediently while corresponding socioeconomic scenarios would be developed in parallel, and to produce a wide range of model responses that may be scaled and interpolated to estimate the response under other scenarios, involving different measures of adaptation and mitigation. In terms of the uncertainties related to the RCP emissions scenarios, the following issues can be identified: *	0
Figure 12.2 | Links in the chain from scenarios, through models to climate projections. The Representative Concentration Pathways  are designed to sample a range of radiative forcing  of the climate system at 2100. The RCPs are translated into both concentrations and emissions of greenhouse gases using Integrated Assessment Models . These are then used as inputs to dynamical Earth System Models  in simulations that are either concentration-driven  or emissions-driven . Aerosols and other forcing factors are implemented in different ways in each ESM. The ESM projections each have a potentially different RF, which may be viewed as an output of the model and which may not correspond to precisely the level of RF indicated by the RCP nomenclature. Similarly, for concentration-driven experiments, the emissions consistent with those concentrations diagnosed from the ESM may be different from those specified in the RCP . Different models produce different responses even under the same RF. Uncertainty propagates through the chain and results in a spread of ESM projections. This spread is only one way of assessing uncertainty in projections. Alternative methods, which combine information from simple and complex models and observations through statistical models or expert judgement, are also used to quantify that uncertainty.	0
Despite the naming of the RCPs in terms of their target RF at 2100 or at stabilization , climate models translate concentrations of forcing agents into RF in different ways due to their different structural modelling assumptions. Hence a model simulation of RCP6.0 may not attain exactly a RF of 6 W m-2; more accurately, an RCP6.0 forced model experiment may not attain exactly the same RF as was intended by the specification of the RCP6.0 forcing inputs. Thus in addition to the scenario uncertainty there is RF uncertainty in the way the RCP scenarios are implemented in climate models. Some model simulations are concentration-driven  whereas some models, which have Earth Systems components, convert emission scenarios into concentrations and are termed emissions-driven. Different ESMs driven by emissions may produce different concentrations of GHGs and aerosols because of differences in the representation and/or parameterization of the processes responsible for the conversion of emissions into concentrations. This aspect may be considered a facet of forcing uncertainty, or may be compounded in the category of model uncertainty, which we discuss below. Also, aerosol loading and land use changes are not dictated intrinsically by the RCP specification. Rather, they are a result of the Integrated Assessment Model that created the emission pathway for a given RCP.	0
SRES and RCPs account for future changes only in anthropogenic forcings. With regard to solar forcing, the 1985-2005 solar cycle is repeated. Neither projections of future deviations from this solar cycle, nor future volcanic RF and their uncertainties are considered. Any climate projection is subject to sampling uncertainties that arise because of internal variability. In this chapter, the prediction of, for example, the amplitude or phase of some mode of variability that may be important on long time scales is not addressed . Any climate variable projection derived from a single simulation of an individual climate model will be affected by internal variability , whether it be a variable that involves a long time average , a snapshot in time or some more complex diagnostic such as the variance computed from a time series over many years. No amount of time averaging can reduce internal variability to zero, although for some EMICs and simplified models, which may be used to reproduce the results of more complex model simulations, the representation of internal variability is excluded from the model specification by design. For different variables, and different spatial and time scale averages, the relative importance of internal variability in comparison with other sources of uncertainty will be different. In general, internal variability becomes more important on shorter time scales and for smaller scale variables . The concept of signal-to-noise ratio may be used to quantify the relative magnitude of the forced response  versus internal variability . Internal variability may be sampled and estimated explicitly by running ensembles of simulations with slightly different initial conditions, designed explicitly to represent internal variability, or can be estimated on the basis of long control runs where external forcings are held constant. In the case of both multi-model and perturbed physics ensembles , there is an implicit perturbation in the initial state of each run considered, which	0
means that these ensembles sample both modelling uncertainty and internal variability jointly. The ability of models to mimic nature is achieved by simplification choices that can vary from model to model in terms of the fundamental numeric and algorithmic structures, forms and values of parameterizations, and number and kinds of coupled processes included. Simplifications and the interactions between parameterized and resolved processes induce `errors' in models, which can have a leading-order impact on projections. It is possible to characterize the choices made when building and running models into structural--indicating the numerical techniques used for solving the dynamical equations, the analytic form of parameterization schemes and the choices of inputs for fixed or varying boundary conditions--and parametric--indicating the choices made in setting the parameters that control the various components of the model. The community of climate modellers has regularly collaborated in producing coordinated experiments forming multi-model ensembles , using both global and regional model families, for example, CMIP3/5 , ENSEMBLES  and Chemistry-Climate Model Validation 1 and 2 , through which structural uncertainty can be at least in part explored by comparing models, and perturbed physics ensembles , Model for Interdiciplinary Research On Climate , Community Climate System Model 3 ), through which uncertainties in parameterization choices can be assessed in a given model. As noted below, neither MMEs nor PPEs represent an adequate sample of all the possible choices one could make in building a climate model. Also, current models may exclude some processes that could turn out to be important for projections  or produce a common error in the representation of a particular process. For this reason, it is of critical importance to distinguish two different senses in which the uncertainty terminology is used or misused in the literature . A narrow interpretation of the concept of model uncertainty often identifies it with the range of responses of a model ensemble. In this chapter this type of characterization is referred as model range or model spread. A broader concept entails the recognition of a fundamental uncertainty in the representation of the real system that these models can achieve, given their necessary approximations and the limits in the scientific understanding of the real system that they encapsulate. When addressing this aspect and characterizing it, this chapter uses the term model uncertainty. The relative role of the different sources of uncertainty--model, scenario and internal variability--as one moves from short- to mid- to long-term projections and considers different variables at different spatial scales has to be recognized . The three sources exchange relevance as the time horizon, the spatial scale and the variable change. In absolute terms, internal variability is generally estimated, and has been shown in some specific studies  to remain approximately constant across the forecast horizon, with model ranges and scenario/forcing variability increasing over time. For forecasts of global temperatures after mid-century, scenario and model ranges dominate the amount of variation due to internally generated variability, with scenarios accounting for the largest source 1039	0
of uncertainty in projections by the end of the century. For global average precipitation projections, scenario uncertainty has a much smaller role even by the end of the 21st century and model range maintains the largest share across all projection horizons. For temperature and precipitation projections at smaller spatial scales, internal variability may remain a significant source of uncertainty up until middle of the 21st century in some regions . Within single model experiments, the persistently significant role of internally generated variability for regional projections even beyond short- and mid-term horizons has been documented by analyzing relatively large ensembles sampling initial conditions .	0
of possible values are explored and often statistical models that fit the relationship between parameter values and model output, that is, emulators, are trained on the ensemble and used to predict the outcome for unsampled parameter value combinations, in order to explore the parameter space more thoroughly that would otherwise be computationally affordable . The space of a single model simulations  can show a large range of outcomes for a given scenario . However, multi-model ensembles and perturbed physics ensembles produce modes and distributions of climate responses that can be different from one another, suggesting that one type of ensemble cannot be used as an analogue for the other .	0
12.2.3 From Ensembles to Uncertainty Quantification Ensembles like CMIP5 do not represent a systematically sampled family of models but rely on self-selection by the modelling groups. This opportunistic nature of MMEs has been discussed, for example, in Tebaldi and Knutti  and Knutti et al. . These ensembles are therefore not designed to explore uncertainty in a coordinated manner, and the range of their results cannot be straightforwardly interpreted as an exhaustive range of plausible outcomes, even if some studies have shown how they appear to behave as well calibrated probabilistic forecasts for some large-scale quantities . Other studies have argued instead that the tail of distributions is by construction undersampled . In general, the difficulty in producing quantitative estimates of uncertainty based on multiple model output originates in their peculiarities as a statistical sample, neither random nor systematic, with possible dependencies among the members  and of spurious nature, that is, often counting among their members models with different degrees of complexities  even within the category of general circulation models.	0
Agreement between multiple models can be a source of information in an uncertainty assessment or confidence statement. Various methods have been proposed to indicate regions where models agree on the projected changes, agree on no change or disagree. Several of those methods are compared in Box 12.1. Many figures use stippling or hatching to display such information, but it is important to note that confidence cannot be inferred from model agreement alone. Perturbed physics experiments  differ in their output interpretability for they can be, and have been, systematically constructed and as such lend themselves to a more straightforward treatment through statistical modelling . Uncertain parameters in a single model to whose values the output is known to be sensitive are targeted for perturbations. More often it is the parameters in the atmospheric component of the model that are varied , and to date have in fact shown to be the source of the largest uncertainties in large-scale response, but lately, with much larger computing power expense, also parameters within the ocean component have been perturbed . Parameters in the land surface schemes have also been subject to perturbation studies . Ranges 1040	0
Many studies have made use of results from these ensembles to characterize uncertainty in future projections, and these will be assessed and their results incorporated when describing specific aspects of future climate responses. PPEs have been uniformly treated across the different studies through the statistical framework of analysis of computer experiments  or, more plainly, as a thorough exploration of alternative responses reweighted by observational constraints . In all cases the construction of a probability distribution is facilitated by the systematic nature of the experiments. MMEs have generated a much more diversified treatment  according to the choice of applying weights to the different models on the basis of past performance or not  and  according to the choice between treating the different models and the truth as indistinguishable or treating each model as a version of the truth to which an error has been added . Many studies can be classified according to these two criteria and their combination, but even within each of the four resulting categories different studies produce different estimates of uncertainty, owing to the preponderance of a priori assumptions, explicitly in those studies that approach the problem through a Bayesian perspective, or only implicit in the choice of likelihood models, or weighting. This makes the use of probabilistic and other results produced through statistical inference necessarily dependent on agreeing with a particular set of assumptions , given the lack of a full exploration of the robustness of probabilistic estimates to varying these assumptions. In summary, there does not exist at present a single agreed on and robust formal methodology to deliver uncertainty quantification estimates of future changes in all climate variables . As a consequence, in this chapter, statements using the calibrated uncertainty language are a result of the expert judgement of the authors, combining assessed literature results with an evaluation of models demonstrated ability  in simulating the relevant processes  and model consensus  over future projections. In some cases when a significant relation is detected between model performance and reliability of its future projections, some models  may be excluded  but in general it remains an open research question to find significant connections of this kind that justify some form of weighting across the ensemble of models and produce aggregated	0
Box 12.1 | Methods to Quantify Model Agreement in Maps The climate change projections in this report are based on ensembles of climate models. The ensemble mean is a useful quantity to characterize the average response to external forcings, but does not convey any information on the robustness of this response across models, its uncertainty and/or likelihood or its magnitude relative to unforced climate variability. In the IPCC AR4 WGI contribution  several criteria were used to indicate robustness of change, most prominently in Figure SPM.7. In that figure, showing projected precipitation changes, stippling marked regions where at least 90% of the CMIP3 models agreed on the sign of the change. Regions where less than 66% of the models agreed on the sign were masked white. The resulting large white area was often misinterpreted as indicating large uncertainties in the different models' response to external forcings, but recent studies show that, for the most part, the disagreement in sign among models is found where projected changes are small and still within the modelled range of internal variability, that is, where a response to anthropogenic forcings has not yet emerged locally in a statistically significant way . A number of methods to indicate model robustness, involving an assessment of the significance of the change when compared to internal variability, have been proposed since AR4. The different methods share the purpose of identifying regions with large, significant or robust changes, regions with small changes, regions where models disagree or a combination of those. They do, however, use different assumptions about the statistical properties of the model ensemble, and therefore different criteria for synthesizing the information from it. Different methods also differ in the way they estimate internal variability. We briefly describe and compare several of these methods here. Method : The default method used in Chapters 11,12 and 14 as well as in the Annex I  is shown in Box 12.1, Figure 1a, and is based on relating the climate change signal to internal variability in 20-year means of the models as a reference3. Regions where the multi-model mean change exceeds two standard deviations of internal variability and where at least 90% of the models agree on the sign of change are stippled and interpreted as `large change with high model agreement'. Regions where the model mean is less than one standard deviation of internal variability are hatched and interpreted as `small signal or low agreement of models'. This can have various reasons:  changes in individual models are smaller than internal variability, or  although changes in individual models are significant, they disagree about the sign and the multi-model mean change remains small. Using this method, the case where all models scatter widely around zero and the case where all models agree on near zero change therefore are both hatched . Method : Method  does not distinguish the case where all models agree on no change and the case where, for example, half of the models show a significant increase and half a decrease. The distinction may be relevant for many applications and a modification of method  is to restrict hatching to regions where there is high agreement among the models that the change will be `small', thus eliminating the ambiguous interpretation `small or low agreement' in . In contrast to method  where the model mean is compared to variability, this case  marks regions where at least 80% of the individual models show a change smaller than two standard deviations of variability with hatching. Grid points where many models show significant change but don't agree are no longer hatched .	0
Method : Knutti and Sedlaek  define a dimensionless robustness measure, R, which is inspired by the signal-to-noise ratio and the ranked probability skill score. It considers the natural variability and agreement on magnitude and sign of change. A value of  R = 1 implies perfect model agreement; low or negative values imply poor model agreement . Any level of R can be chosen for the stippling. For illustration, in Box 12.1, Figure 1c, regions with R > 0.8 are marked with small dots, regions with R > 0.9 with larger dots and are interpreted as `robust large change'. This yields similar results to method  for the end of the century, but with some areas of moderate model robustness  already for the near-term projections, even though the signal is still within the noise. Regions where at least 80% of the models individually show no significant change are hatched and interpreted as `changes unlikely to emerge from variability'4.There is less hatching in this method than in method , 	0
The internal variability in this method is estimated using pre-industrial control runs for each of the models which are at least 500 years long. The first 100 years of the pre-industrial are ignored. Variability is calculated for every grid point as the standard deviation of non-overlapping 20-year means, multiplied by the square root of 2 to account for the fact that the variability of a difference in means is of interest. A quadratic fit as a function of time is subtracted from these at every grid point to eliminate model drift. This is by definition the standard deviation of the difference between two independent 20-year averages having the same variance and estimates the variation of that difference that would be expected due to unforced internal variability. The median across all models of that quantity is used. Variability in methods b-d is estimated from interannual variations in the base period within each model.	0
Box 12.1, Figure 1 | Projected change in December to February precipitation for 2016-2035 and 2081-2100, relative to 1986-2005 from CMIP5 models. The choice of the variable and time frames is just for illustration of how the different methods compare in cases with low and high signal-to-noise ratio . The colour maps are identical along each column and only stippling and hatching differ on the basis of the different methods. Different methods for stippling and hatching are shown determined  from relating the model mean to internal variability,  as in  but hatching here indicates high agreement for `small change',  by the robustness measure by Knutti and Sedlaek ,  by the method proposed by Tebaldi et al.  and  by the method by Power et al. . Detailed technical explanations for each method are given in the text. 39 models are used in all panels.	0
because it requires 80% of the models to be within variability, not just the model average. Regions where at least 50% of the models show significant change but R< 0.5 are masked as white to indicate `models disagreeing on the projected change projections' . Method : Tebaldi et al.  start from IPCC AR4 SPM7 but separate lack of model agreement from lack of signal . Grid points are stippled and interpreted as `robust large change' when more than 50% of the models show significant change and at least 80% of those agree on the sign of change. Grid points where more than 50% of the models show significant change but less than 80% of those agree on the sign of change are masked as white and interpreted as `unreliable'. The results are again similar to the methods above. No hatching was defined in that method .  Method : Power et al.  identify three distinct regions using various methods in which projections can be very loosely described as either: `statistically significant', `small  or zero, but not statistically significant' or `uncertain'. The emphasis with this approach is to identify robust signals taking the models at face value and to address the questions:  What will change?  By how much? and  What will not change? The underlying consideration here is that statistical testing under the assumption of model independence provides a worthwhile, albeit imperfect, line of evidence that needs to be considered in conjunction with other evidence , in order to assess the degree of confidence one has in a projected change. The examples given here are not exhaustive but illustrate the main ideas. Other methods include simply counting the number of models agreeing on the sign , or varying colour hue and saturation to indicate magnitude of change and robustness of change separately . In summary, there are a variety of ways to characterize magnitude or significance of change, and agreement between models. There is also a compromise to make between clarity and richness of information. Different methods serve different purposes and a variety of criteria can be justified to highlight specific properties of multi-model ensembles. Clearly only a subset of information regarding robust and uncertain change can be conveyed in a single plot. The methods above convey some important pieces of this information, but obviously more information could be provided if more maps with additional statistics were provided. In fact Annex I provides more explicit information on the range of projected changes evident in the models . For most of the methods there is a necessity to choose thresholds for the level of agreement that cannot be identified objectively, but could be the result of individual, application-specific evaluations. Note also that all of the above methods measure model agreement in an ensemble of opportunity, and it is impossible to derive a confidence or likelihood statement from the model agreement or model spread alone, without considering consistency with observations, model dependence and the degree to which the relevant processes are understood and reflected in the models . The method used by Power et al.  differs from the other methods in that it tests the statistical significance of the ensemble mean rather than a single simulation. As a result, the area where changes are significant increases with an increasing number of models. Already for the period centred on 2025, most of the grid points when using this method show significant change in the ensemble mean whereas in the other methods projections for this time period are classified as changes not exceeding internal variability. The reason is that the former produces a statement about the mean of the distribution being significantly different from zero, equivalent to treating the ensemble as `truth plus error', that is, assuming that the models are independent and randomly distributed around reality. Methods a-d, on the other hand, use an `indistinguishable' interpretation, in which each model and reality are drawn from the same distribution. In that case, the stippling and hatching characterize the likelihood of a single member being significant or not, rather than the ensemble mean. There is some debate in the literature on how the multi-model ensembles should be interpreted statistically. This and past IPCC reports treat the model spread as some measure of uncertainty, irrespective of the number of models, which implies an `indistinguishable' interpretation. For a detailed discussion readers are referred to the literature .	0
While many of the key processes relevant to the simulation of single variables are understood, studies are only starting to focus on assessing projections of joint variables, especially when extremes or variability in the individual quantities are of concern. A few studies have addressed projected changes in joint variables, for example, by combining mean temperature and precipitation , linking soil moisture, precipitation and temperature mean and variability , combining temperature and humidity , linking summertime temperature and soil moisture to prior winter snowpack  or linking precipitation change to circulation, moisture and moist static energy budget changes . Models may have difficulties simulating all relevant interactions between atmosphere and land surface and the water cycle that determine the joint response, observations to evaluate models are often limited , and model uncertainties are therefore large . In some cases, correlations between, for example, temperature and precipitation or accumulated precipitation and temperature have found to be too strong in climate models . The situation is further complicated by the fact that model biases in one variable affect other variables. The standard method for model projections is to subtract model biases derived from control integrations . Several studies note that this may be problematic when a consistent treatment of biases in multiple variables is required , but there is no consensus at this stage for a methodology addressing this problem . More generally the existence of structural errors in models according to which an unavoidable discrepancy  between their simulations and reality cannot be avoided is relevant here, as well as for univariate projections. In the recent literature an estimate of this discrepancy has been proposed through the use of MMEs, using each model in turn as a surrogate for reality, and measuring the distance between it and the other models of the ensemble. Some summary statistic of these measures is then used to estimate the distance between models and the real world . Statistical frameworks to deal with multivariate projections are challenging even for just two variables, as they have to address a trade-off between modelling the joint behavior at scales that are relevant for impacts-- that is, fine spatial and temporal scales, often requiring complex spatio-temporal models--and maintaining computational feasibility. In one instance  scales were investigated at the seasonal and sub-continental level, and projections of the forced response of temperature and precipitation at those scales did not show 1044	0
significant correlations, likely because of the heterogeneity of the relation between the variables within those large averaged regions and seasons. In Sexton et al.  the spatial scale focussed on regions of Great Britain and correlation emerged as more significant, for example, between summer temperatures and precipitation amounts. Fischer and Knutti  estimated strong relationships between variables making up impact relevant indices  and showed how in some cases, uncertainties across models are larger for a combined variable than if the uncertainties in the individual underlying variables were treated independently , whereas in other cases the uncertainties in the combined variables are smaller than in the individual ones . Even while recognizing the need for joint multivariate projections, the above limitations at this stage prevent a quantitative assessment for most cases. A few robust qualitative relationships nonetheless emerge from the literature and these are assessed, where appropriate, in the rest of the chapter. For applications that are sensitive to relationships between variables, but still choose to use the multi-model framework to determine possible ranges for projections, sampling from univariate ranges may lead to unrealistic results when significant correlations exist. IPCC assessments often show model averages as best estimates, but such averages can underestimate spatial variability, and more in general they neither represent any of the actual model states  nor do they necessarily represent the joint best estimate in a multivariate sense. Impact studies usually need temporally and spatially coherent multivariate input from climate model simulations. In those cases, using each climate model output individually and feeding it into the impact model, rather than trying to summarise a multivariate distribution from the MME and sample from it, is likely to be more consistent, assuming that the climate model itself correctly captures the spatial covariance, the temporal co-evolution and the relevant feedbacks.	0
The experiments that form the basis of global future projections discussed in this chapter are extensions of the simulations of the observational record discussed in Chapters 9 and 10. The scenarios assessed in AR5, introduced in Chapter 1, include four new scenarios designed to explore a wide range of future climate characterized by representative trajectories of well-mixed greenhouse gas  concentrations and other anthropogenic forcing agents. These are described further in Section 12.3.1. The implementation of forcing agents in model projections, including natural and anthropogenic aerosols, ozone and land use change are discussed in Section 12.3.2, with a strong focus on CMIP5 experiments. Global mean emissions, concentrations and RFs applicable to the historical record simulations assessed in Chapters 8, 9 and 10, and the future scenario simulations assessed here, are listed in Annex II. Global mean RF for the 21st century consistent with these scenarios, derived from CMIP5 and other climate model studies, is discussed in Section 12.3.3.	0
Long-term climate change projections reflect how human activities or natural effects could alter the climate over decades and centuries. In this context, defined scenarios are important, as using specific time series of emissions, land use, atmospheric concentrations or RF across multiple models allows for coherent climate model intercomparisons and synthesis. Some scenarios present a simple stylized future  and are used for process understanding. More comprehensive scenarios are produced by Integrated Assessment Models  as internally consistent sets of emissions and socioeconomic assumptions  with the aim of presenting several plausible future worlds . In general it is these scenarios that are used for policy relevant climate change, impact, adaptation and mitigation analysis. It is beyond the scope of this report to consider the full range of currently published scenarios and their implications for mitigation policy and climate targets--that is covered by the Working Group III contribution to the AR5. Here, we focus on the RCP scenarios used within the CMIP5 intercomparison exercise  along with the SRES scenarios  developed for the IPCC Third Assessment Report  but still widely used by the climate community.	0
12.3.1.1 Stylized Concentration Scenarios A 1% per annum compound increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration until a doubling or a quadrupling of its initial value has been widely used since the second phase of CMIP  and the Second Assessment Report . This stylized scenario is a useful benchmark for comparing coupled model climate sensitivity, climate feedback and transient climate response, but is not used directly for future projections. The exponential increase of CO2 concentration induces approximately a linear increase in RF due to a `saturation effect' of the strong absorbing bands . Thus, a linear ramp function in forcing results from these stylized pathways, adding to their suitability for comparative diagnostics of the models' climate feedbacks and inertia. The CMIP5 intercomparison project again includes such a stylized pathway, in which the CO2 concentration reaches twice the initial concentration after 70 years and four times the initial concentration after 140 years. The corresponding RFs are 3.7 W m-2  and 7.4 W m-2 respectively with a range of 20% accounting for uncertainties in radiative transfer calculations and rapid adjustments , placing them within the range of the RFs at the end of the 21st century for the future scenarios presented below. The CMIP5 project also includes a second stylized experiment in which the CO2 concentration is quadrupled instantaneously, which allows a distinction between effective RFs and longer-term climate feedbacks .	0
resulted from specific socioeconomic scenarios, that is, from storylines about future demographic and economic development, regionalization, energy production and use, technology, agriculture, forestry, and land use. All SRES scenarios assumed that no climate mitigation policy would be undertaken. Based on these SRES scenarios, global climate models were then forced with corresponding WMGHG and aerosol concentrations, although the degree to which models implemented these forcings differed . The resulting climate projections, together with the socioeconomic scenarios on which they are based, have been widely used in further analysis by the impact, adaptation and vulnerability research communities.	0
12.3.1.3 The New Concentration Driven Representative Concentration Pathway Scenarios, and Their Extensions As introduced in Box 1.1 and mentioned in Section 12.1, a new parallel process for scenario development was proposed in order to facilitate the interactions between the scientific communities working on climate change, adaptation and mitigation . These new scenarios, Representative Concentration Pathways, are referred to as pathways in order to emphasize that they are not definitive scenarios, but rather internally consistent sets of time-dependent forcing projections that could potentially be realized with more than one underlying socioeconomic scenario. The primary products of the RCPs are concentrations but they also provide gas emissions. They are representative in that they are one of several different scenarios, sampling the full range of published scenarios  at the time they were defined, that have similar RF and emissions characteristics. They are identified by the approximate value of the RF  at 2100 or at stabilization after 2100 in their extensions, relative to pre-industrial . RCP2.6  peaks at 3.0 W m-2 and then declines to 2.6 W m-2 in 2100, RCP4.5  and RCP6.0  stabilize after 2100 at 4.2 and 6.0 W m-2 respectively, while RCP8.5  reaches 8.3 W m-2 in 2100 on a rising trajectory . The primary objective of these scenarios is to provide all the input variables necessary to run comprehensive climate models in order to reach a target RF . These scenarios were developed using IAMs that provide the time evolution of a large ensemble of anthropogenic forcings  and their individual RF values . Note that due to the substantial uncertainties in RF, these forcing values should be understood as comparative `labels', not as exact definitions of the forcing that is effective in climate models. This is because concentrations or emissions, rather than the RF itself, are prescribed in the CMIP5 climate model runs. The forcing as manifested in climate models is discussed in Section 12.3.3. Various steps were necessary to turn the selected `raw' RCP scenarios from the IAMs into data sets usable by the climate modelling community. First, harmonization with historical data was performed for emissions of reactive gases and aerosols , land use , and for GHG emissions and concentrations . Then 1045	0

Positive values correspond to the total anthropogenic RF. Negative values correspond to the forcing from all anthropogenic aerosol-radiation interactions .

atmospheric chemistry runs were performed to estimate ozone and aerosol distributions . Finally, a single carbon cycle model with a representation of carbon-climate feedbacks was used in order to provide consistent values of CO2 concentration for the CO2 emission provided by a different IAM for each of the scenarios. This methodology was used to produce consistent data sets across scenarios but does not provide uncertainty estimates for them. After these processing steps, the final RCP data sets comprise land use data, harmonized GHG emissions and concentrations, gridded reactive gas and aerosol emissions, as well as ozone and aerosol abundance fields. These data are used as forcings in individual climate models. The 1046	0
been aggregated into a few groups in Figure 12.3b and c. The total anthropogenic RF estimated by the IAMs in 2010 is about 0.15 W m-2 lower than Chapter 8's best estimate of ERF in 2010 , the difference arising from a revision of the RF due to aerosols and land use in the current assessment compared to AR4. All the other individual forcings are consistent to within 0.02 W m-2. The change in CO2 concentration is the main cause of difference in the total RF among the scenarios . The relative contribution5 of CO2 to the total anthropogenic forcing is currently  about 80 to 90% and does not vary much across the scenarios , as was also the case for SRES scenarios . Aerosols have a large negative contribution to the total forcing , but this contribution decreases  in the future for all the RCPs scenarios. This means that while anthropogenic aerosols have had a cooling effect in the past, their decrease in all RCP scenarios relative to current levels is expected to have a net warming effect in the future . The 21st century decrease in the magnitude of future aerosol forcing was not as large and as rapid in the SRES scenarios . However, even in the SRES scenarios, aerosol effects were expected to have a diminishing role in the future compared to GHG forcings, mainly because of the accumulation of GHG in the atmosphere . Other forcings do not change much in the future, except CH4 which increases in the RCP8.5 scenario. Note that the estimates of all of these individual RFs are subject to many uncertainties . In this section and in Table AII.6.8, the RF values for RCP scenarios are derived from published equivalent-CO2  concentration data that aggregates all anthropogenic forcings including GHGs and aerosols. The conversion to RF uses the formula: RF = 3.71/ln  ln W m-2, where CO2eq is in ppmv. The four RCPs  are based on IAMs up to the end of the 21st century only. In order to investigate longer-term climate change implications, these RCPs were also extended until 2300. The extensions, formally named Extended Concentration Pathways  but often simply referred to as RCP extensions, use simple assumptions about GHG and aerosol emissions and concentrations beyond 2100  and were designed as hypothetical `what-if' scenarios, not as an outcome of an IAM assuming socioeconomic considerations beyond 2100  . In order to continue to investigate a broad range of possible climate futures, RCP2.6 assumes small constant net negative emissions after 2100 and RCP8.5 assumes stabilization with high emissions between 2100 and 2150, then a linear decrease until 2250. The two middle RCPs aim for a smooth stabilization of concentrations by 2150. RCP8.5 stabilizes concentrations only by 2250, with CO2 concentrations of approximately 2000 ppmv, nearly seven times the pre-industrial level. As RCP2.6 implies net negative CO2 emissions after around 2070 and throughout the extension, CO2 concentrations slowly reduce towards 360 ppmv by 2300.	0
12.3.1.4 Comparison of Special Report on Emission Scenarios and Representative Concentration Pathway Scenarios The four RCP scenarios used in CMIP5 lead to RF values that range from 2.3 to 8.0 W m-2 at 2100, a wider range than that of the three SRES scenarios used in CMIP3 which vary from 4.2 to 8.1 W m-2 at 2100 . The SRES scenarios do not assume any policy to control climate change, unlike the RCP scenarios. The RF of RCP2.6 is hence lower by 1.9 W m-2 than the three SRES scenarios and very close to the ENSEMBLES E1 scenario . RCP4.5 and SRES B1 have similar RF at 2100, and comparable time evolution . The RF of SRES A2 is lower than RCP8.5 throughout the 21st century, mainly due to a faster decline in the radiative effect of aerosols in RCP8.5 than SRES A2, but they converge to within 0.1 W m-2 at 2100. RCP6.0 lies in between SRES B1 and SRES A1B. Results obtained with one General Circulation Model   and with a reduced-complexity model  confirm that the differences in temperature responses are consistent with the differences in RFs estimates. RCP2.6, which assumes strong mitigation action, yields a smaller temperature increase than any SRES scenario. The temperature increase with the RCP4.5 and SRES B1 scenarios are close and the temperature increase is larger with RCP8.5 than with SRES A2. The spread of projected global mean temperature for the RCP scenarios  is considerably larger  than for the three SRES scenarios used in CMIP3  as a direct consequence of the larger range of RF across the RCP scenarios compared to that across the three SRES scenarios .	0
The CMIP5 experimental protocol for long-term transient climate experiments prescribes a common basis for a comprehensive set of anthropogenic forcing agents acting as boundary conditions in three experimental phases--historical, RCPs and ECPs . To permit common implementations of this set of forcing agents in CMIP5 models, self-consistent forcing data time series have been computed and provided to participating models  comprising emissions or concentrations of GHGs and related compounds, ozone and atmospheric aerosols and their chemical precursors, and land use change. The forcing agents implemented in Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models  and ESMs used to make long-term climate projections in CMIP5 are summarized in Table 12.1. The number of CMIP5 models listed here is about double the number of CMIP3 models listed in Table 10.1 of AR4 . Natural forcings  are also specified elements in the CMIP5 experimental protocol, but their future time evolutions are not prescribed	0

very precisely. A repeated 11-year cycle for total solar irradiance  is suggested for future projections but the periodicity is not specified precisely as solar cycles vary in length. Some models include the effect of orbital variations as well, but most do not. For volcanic eruptions, no specific CMIP5 prescription is given for future emissions or concentration data, the general recommendation being that volcanic aerosols should either be omitted entirely both from the control experiment and future projections or the same background volcanic aerosols should be prescribed in both. This provides a consistent framework for model intercomparison given a lack of knowledge of when future large eruptions will occur. In general models have adhered to this guidance, but there are variations in the background volcanic aerosol levels chosen  and some cases, for example, Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator 1.0 and ACCESS1.3 , where the background volcanic aerosol in future differs significantly from that in the control experiment, with a small effect on future RF. For the other natural aerosols , no emission or concentration data are recommended. The emissions are potentially computed interactively by the models themselves and may change with climate, or prescribed from separate model simulations carried out in the implementation of CMIP5 experiments, or simply held constant. Natural aerosols  are in a few cases prescribed with no year-to-year variation , in some cases prescribed from data sets computed off-line as described above, and in other cases calculated interactively via prognostic or diagnostic calculations. The degree to which natural aerosol emissions are interactive is effectively greater in some such models than others, however, as mineral dust emissions are more constrained when land vegetation cover is specified -Mk3.6.0)  than when vegetation is allowed to evolve dynamically )  .	0
12.3.2.1 `Emissions-Driven' versus `Concentration Driven' Experiments A novel feature within the CMIP5 experimental design is that experiments with prescribed anthropogenic emissions are included in addition to classical experiments with prescribed concentration pathways for WMGHGs . The essential features of these two classes of experiment are described in Box 6.4. The CMIP5 protocol includes experiments in which `ESMs'  and AOGCMs  are both forced with WMGHG concentration pathways to derive a range of climate responses consistent with those pathways from the two types of model. The range of climate responses including climate-carbon cycle feedbacks can additionally be explored in ESMs driven with emissions rather than concentrations, analogous to Coupled Climate Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project  experiments --see Box 6.4. Results from the two types of experiment cannot be compared directly, but they provide complementary information. Uncertainties in the forward	0
climate response driven with specified emissions or concentrations can be derived from all participating models, while concentration-driven ESM experiments also permit a policy-relevant diagnosis of the range of anthropogenic carbon emissions compatible with the imposed concentration pathways . WMGHG forcing implementations in CMIP5 concentration-driven experiments conform closely in almost all cases to the standard protocol ), imposing an effective control over the RF due to WMGHGs across the multi-model ensemble, apart from the model spread arising from radiative transfer codes . The ability of ESMs to determine their own WMGHG concentrations in emissions-driven experiments means that RF due to WMGHGs is less tightly controlled in such experiments. Even in concentration-driven experiments, many models implement some emissions-driven forcing agents , leading to a potentially greater spread in both the concentrations and hence RF of those emissions-driven agents.	0
12.3.2.2 Variations Between Model Forcing Implementations Apart from the distinction between concentration-driven and emissions-driven protocols, a number of variations are present in the implementation of forcing agents listed in Table 12.1, which generally arise due to constraining characteristics of the model formulations, various computational efficiency considerations or local implementation decisions. In a number of models, off-line modelling using an aerosol chemistry climate model has been used to convert emissions into concentrations compatible with the specific model formulation or characteristics. As a result, although detailed prescriptions are given for the forcing agents in CMIP5 experiments in emissions terms, individual modelling approaches lead to considerable variations in their implementations and consequential RFs. This was also the case in the ENSEMBLES multi-model projections, in which similar forcing agents to CMIP5 models were applied but again with variations in the implementation of aerosol, ozone and land use forcings, prescribing the SRES A1B and E1 scenarios in a concentration-driven protocol  akin to the CMIP5 protocol. Methane, nitrous oxide and CFCs  are generally prescribed in CMIP5 models as wellmixed concentrations following the forcing data time series provided for the given scenarios. In a number of models , GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-p2, GISS-E2-p3, HadGEM2-ES and MRI-ESM1) the three-dimensional concentrations in the atmosphere of some species evolve interactively driven by the full emissions/sinks cycle . In cases where the full emissions/sinks cycle is modelled, the radiation scheme is usually passed the time-varying 3-D concentrations, but some models prescribe different concentrations for the purpose of radiation. Eyring et al.  document, in greater detail than Table 12.1, the implementations of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone in CMIP5 models, including their ozone chemistry schemes and modifications applied to reference data sets in models driven by concentrations. In 1051	0
most models that prescribe ozone, concentrations are based on the original or slightly modified CMIP5 standard ozone data set computed as part of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry/Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate  activity . In the stratosphere, this data set is based on observations of the past  continued into the future with the multi-model mean of 13 chemistry-climate models  projections following the SRES A1B  and SRES A1 adjusted halogen scenario . The stratospheric zonal mean ozone field is merged with a 3-D tropospheric ozone time series generated as the mean of two CCMs , Shindell et al., 2006; CAM3.5, Lamarque et al., 2010) in the past and continued by one CCM  in the future. Some CMIP5 models  prescribe ozone concentrations using different data sets but again following just one GHG scenario in the future for the projection of stratospheric ozone. In other models -CM5, CCSM4) ozone is again prescribed, but supplied as concentrations from off-line computations using a related CCM. Some models determine ozone interactively from specified emissions via on-line atmospheric chemistry , CESM1, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-p2, GISS-E2-p3, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MRI-ESM1; and HadGEM2-ES for tropospheric ozone only). Computing ozone concentrations interactively allows the fast coupling between chemistry and climate to be captured, but modelling of chemistry processes is sometimes simplified ) in comparison with full complexity CCMs to reduce the computational cost. Compared to CMIP3, in which all models prescribed ozone and around half of them used a fixed ozone climatology, this leads to substantial improvement to ozone forcings in CMIP5, although differences remain among the models with interactive chemistry.	0
For atmospheric aerosols, either aerosol precursor emissions-driven or concentration-driven forcings are applied depending on individual model characteristics . A larger fraction of models in CMIP5 than CMIP3 prescribe aerosol precursor emissions rather than concentrations. Many still prescribe concentrations pre-computed either using a directly related aerosol CCM or from output of another, complex, emissions-driven aerosol chemistry model within the CMIP5 process. As for ozone, aerosol concentrations provided from off-line simulations help to reduce the computational burden of the projections themselves. For several of the concentration-driven models , additional emissions-driven simulations have been undertaken to tailor the prescribed concentrations closely to the model's individual aerosol-climate characteristics. Lamarque et al.  provided the recommended CMIP5 aerosols data set which has been used in several of the models driven by concentrations. Compared with the CMIP3 models, a much larger fraction of CMIP5 models now incorporate black and organic carbon aerosol forcings. Also, a larger fraction of CMIP5 than CMIP3 models now includes a range of processes that combine in the effective RF from aerosol- cloud interactions . Previously such processes were generally termed aerosol indirect effects, usually separated into cloud albedo  effect and cloud 1052	0
lifetime  effect. Many CMIP5 models only include the interaction between sulphate aerosol and cloud, and the majority of them only model the effect of aerosols on cloud albedo rather than cloud lifetime . No CMIP5 models represent urban aerosol pollution explicitly so that is not listed in Table 12.1 . Only one model  explicitly includes nitrate aerosol as a separate forcing, though it is also included within the total aerosol mixture in the Max Planck Institute-Earth System Model  model versions. Land use change is typically applied by blending anthropogenic land surface disturbance via crop and pasture fraction changes with underlying land cover maps of natural vegetation, but model variations in the underlying land cover maps and biome modelling mean that the land use forcing agent is impossible to impose in a completely common way at present . Most CMIP5 models represent crop and pasture disturbance separately, while some , MIROC4h, MIROC5) represent crop but not pasture. Some models  allow a dynamical representation of natural vegetation changes alongside anthropogenic disturbance . Treatment of the CO2 emissions associated with land cover changes is also model dependent. Some models do not account for land cover changes at all, some simulate the biophysical effects but are still forced externally by land cover change induced CO2 emissions , while the most advanced ESMs simulate both biophysical effects of land cover changes and their associated CO2 emissions.	0
Quantification of future global mean RF is of interest as it is directly related to changes in the global energy balance of the climate system and resultant climate change. Chapter 8 discusses RF concepts and methods for computing it that form the basis of analysis directly from the output of model projections. We assess three related estimates of projected global mean forcing and its range through the 21st century in the context of forcing estimated for the recent past . The estimates used are: the total forcings for the defined RCP scenarios, harmonized to RF in the past ; the total effective radiative forcing  estimated from CMIP5 models through the 21st century for the four RCP experiments ; and that estimated from models in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project  for RCP time-slice experiments . Methodological differences mean that whereas CMIP5 estimates include both natural and anthropogenic forcings based entirely on ERF, ACCMIP estimates anthropogenic composition forcing only  based on a combination of ERF for aerosols and RF for WMGHG . Note also that total forcing for the defined RCP scenarios is based on Meinshausen et al. 	0
but combining total anthropogenic ERF  with natural  RF. The CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean ERF at 2100  is 2.2, 3.8, 4.8 and 7.6 W m-2 respectively for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 concentration-driven projections, with a 1- range based on annual mean data for year 2100 of about 0.5 to 1.0 W m-2 depending on scenario . The CMIP5-based ERF estimates are close to the total forcing at 2100  of 2.4, 4.0, 5.2 and 8.0 W m-2 as defined for the four RCPs. The spread in ERF indicated from CMIP5 model results with specified GHG concentration pathways is broadly consistent with that found for	0
CMIP3 models for the A1B scenario using the corresponding method . As for CMIP3 models, part of the forcing spread in CMIP5 models  is consistent with differences in GHG forcings arising from the radiative transfer codes . Aerosol forcing implementations in CMIP5 models also vary considerably, however , leading to a spread in aerosol concentrations and forcings which contributes to the overall model spread. A further small source of spread in CMIP5 results possibly arises from an underlying ambiguity in the CMIP5 experimental design regarding the volcanic forcing offset between the historical experiment versus the pre-industrial control experiment. Most models implement zero volcanic forcing in the control experiment but some use constant negative forcing equal to the time-mean of historical volcanic forcing . The effect of this volcanic forcing offset persists into the future projections.	0

This CMIP5-based estimate assumes each model has an invariant climate feedback parameter, calculated from abrupt 4 x CO2 experiments using the method of Gregory et al. . Each individual CMIP5 model's forcing estimate is an average over all available ensemble members, and a 1- inter-model range around the multi-model mean is shaded in light colour. Grey or coloured vertical bars illustrate the 1- range  of anthropogenic composition forcing  estimated in ACCMIP models  for time slice experiments at 1980, 2000, 2030  and 2100 . The ACCMIP ranges plotted have been converted from the 5 to 95% ranges given in Shindell et al.   to a 1- range. Note that the ACCMIP bars at 1980 and 2100 are shifted slightly to aid clarity. The mean ERF diagnosed from 21 CMIP3 models for the SRES A1B scenario, as in Forster and Taylor , is also shown  with a 1- range . The number of models included in CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensemble means is shown colour coded. 	0
ACCMIP projected forcing at 2030  and 2100  is systematically higher than corresponding CMIP5 ERF, although with some overlap between 1- ranges. CMIP5 and ACCMIP comprise different sets of models and they are related in many but not all cases . Confining analysis to a subset of closely related models also gives higher forcing estimates from ACCMIP compared to CMIP5 so the discrepancy in multi-model ensemble mean forcings appears unrelated to the different model samples associated with the two methods of estimation. The discrepancy is thought to originate mostly from differences in the underlying methodologies used to estimate RF, but is not yet well understood . There is high confidence in projections from ACCMIP models  based on the GISS-E2 CMIP5 simulations  and an earlier study with a version of the HadGEM2-ES model related to that used in CMIP5 , consistent with understanding of the processes controlling nitrate formation , that nitrate aerosols  will increase substantially over the 21st century under the RCPs . The magnitude of total aerosol-related forcing  will therefore tend to be underestimated in the CMIP5 multi-model mean ERF, as nitrate aerosol has been omitted as a forcing from almost all CMIP5 models. Natural RF variations are, by their nature, difficult to project reliably . There is very high confidence that Industrial Era natural forcing has been a small fraction of the  anthropogenic forcing except for brief periods following large volcanic eruptions . Based on that assessment and the assumption that variability in natural forcing remains of a similar magnitude and character to that over the Industrial Era, total anthropogenic forcing relative to pre-industrial, for any of the RCP scenarios through the 21st century, is very likely to be greater in magnitude than changes in natural  forcing on decadal time scales.	0
. Temperature increases are almost the same for all the RCP scenarios during the first two decades after 2005 . At longer time scales, the warming rate begins to depend more on the specified GHG concentration pathway, being highest  in the highest RCP8.5 and significantly lower in RCP2.6, particularly after about 2050 when global surface temperature response stabilizes . The dependence of global temperature rise on GHG forcing at longer time scales has been confirmed by several studies . In the CMIP5 ensemble mean, global warming under RCP2.6 stays below 2C above 1850-1900 levels throughout the 21st century, clearly demonstrating the potential of mitigation policies . This is in agreement with previous studies of aggressive mitigation scenarios . Note, however, that some individual ensemble members do show warming exceeding 2C above 1850-1900 . As for the other pathways, global warming exceeds 2C within the 21st century under RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, in qualitative agreement with previous studies using the SRES A1B and A2 scenarios . Global mean temperature increase exceeds 4C under RCP8.5 by 2100. The CMIP5 concentration-driven global temperature projections are broadly similar to CMIP3 SRES scenarios discussed in AR4  and Section 12.4.9, although the overall range of the former is larger primarily because of the low-emission mitigation pathway RCP2.6 .	0

Projections are shown for each RCP for the multi-model mean  and the 5 to 95% range  across the distribution of individual models . Discontinuities at 2100 are due to different numbers of models performing the extension runs beyond the 21st century and have no physical meaning.

Table 12.2 | CMIP5 annual mean surface air temperature anomalies  from the 1986-2005 reference period for selected time periods, regions and RCPs. The multi-model mean 1 standard deviation ranges across the individual models are listed and the 5 to 95% ranges from the models' distribution  are given in brackets. Only one ensemble member is used from each model and the number of models differs for each RCP  and becomes significantly smaller after 2100. No ranges are given for the RCP6.0 projections beyond 2100 as only two models are available. Using Hadley Centre/Climate Research Unit gridded surface temperature data set 4  and its uncertainty estimate , the observed warming to the 1986-2005 reference period  is 0.61C  0.06C , 0.30C  0.03C , 0.11C  0.02C .

included here. Warming in 2046-2065 is slightly larger under RCP4.5 compared to RCP6.0, consistent with its greater total anthropogenic forcing at that time . For all other periods the magnitude of global temperature change increases from RCP2.6 to RCP8.5. Beyond 2100, RCP2.6 shows a decreasing trend whereas under all other RCPs warming continues to increase. Also shown in Table 12.2 are projected changes at 2081-2100 averaged over land and ocean separately as well as area-weighted averages over the Tropics , Arctic  and Antarctic  regions. Surface air temperatures over land warm more than over the ocean, and northern polar regions warm more than the tropics. The excess of land mass in the Northern Hemisphere  in comparison with the Southern Hemisphere , coupled with the greater uptake of heat by the Southern Ocean in comparison with northern ocean basins means that the NH generally warms more than the SH. Arctic warming is much greater than in the Antarctic, due to the presence of the Antarctic ice sheet and differences in local responses in snow and ice. Mechanisms behind these features of warming are discussed in Section 12.4.3. Maps and time series of regional temperature changes are displayed in Annex I and regional averages are discussed in Section 14.8.1. Global annual multi-model mean temperature changes above 18501900 are listed in Table 12.3 for the 2081-2100 period  along with the percentage of 2081-2100 projections from the CMIP5 models exceeding policy-relevant temperature levels under each RCP. These complement a similar discussion for the near-term projections in Table 11.3 which are based on the CMIP5 ensemble as well as evidence  that some CMIP5 models have a higher sensitivity to GHGs and a larger response to other anthropogenic forcings  than the real world . The percentage calculations for the long-term projections in Table 12.3 are based solely on the CMIP5 ensemble, using one ensemble member for each model. For these long-term projections, the 5 to 95% ranges of the CMIP5 model ensemble are considered the likely range, an assessment based on the fact that the 5 to 95% range of CMIP5 models'	0
TCR coincides with the assessed likely range of the TCR . Based on this assessment, global mean temperatures averaged in the period 2081-2100 are projected to likely exceed 1.5C above 1850-1900 for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 . They are also likely to exceed 2C above 1850-1900 for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5  and more likely than not to exceed 2C for RCP4.5 . Temperature change above 2C under RCP2.6 is unlikely but is assessed only with medium confidence as some CMIP5 ensemble members do produce a global mean temperature change above 2C. Warming above 4C by 2081- 2100 is unlikely in all RCPs  except RCP8.5. Under the latter, the 4C global temperature level is exceeded in more than half of ensemble members, and is assessed to be about as likely as not . Note that the likelihoods of exceeding specific temperature levels show some sensitivity to the choice of reference period . CMIP5 models on average project a gradual increase in global precipitation over the 21st century: change exceeds 0.05 mm day-1  and 0.15 mm day-1  by 2100 in RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. The relationship between global precipitation and global temperature is approximately linear . The precipitation sensitivity, that is, the change of global precipitation with temperature, is about 1 to 3% C-1 in most models, tending to be highest for RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 . These behaviours are consistent with previous studies, including CMIP3 model projections for SRES scenarios and AR4 constant composition commitment experiments , and ENSEMBLES multi-model results for SRES A1B and E1 scenarios . The processes that govern global precipitation changes are now well understood and have been presented in Section 7.6. They are briefly summarized here and used to interpret the long-term projected changes. The precipitation sensitivity  is very different from the water vapour sensitivity  as the main physical 1055	0
circulation, moisture and temperature . Indeed, the radiative cooling of the atmosphere is balanced by latent heating  and sensible heating. Since AR4, the changes in heat balance and their effects on precipitation have been analyzed in detail for a large variety of forcings, simulations and models . An increase of CO2 decreases the radiative cooling of the troposphere and reduces precipitation . On longer time scales than the fast hydrological adjustment time scale , the increase of CO2 induces a slow increase of temperature and water vapour, thereby enhancing the radiative cooling of the atmosphere and increasing global precipitation . Even after the CO2 forcing stabilizes or begins to decrease, the ocean continues to warm, which then drives up global temperature, evaporation and precipitation. In addition, nonlinear effects also affect precipitation changes . These different effects explain the steepening of the precipitation versus temperature relationship in RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios , as RF stabilizes and/or declines from the mid-century . In idealized CO2 ramp-up/ramp-down experiments, this effect produces an hydrological response overshoot . An increase of absorbing aerosols warms the atmosphere and reduces precipitation, and the surface temperature response may be too small to compensate this decrease . Change in scattering aerosols or incoming solar radiation modifies global precipitation mainly via the response of the surface temperature . The main reasons for the inter-model spread of the precipitation sensitivity estimate among GCMs have not been fully understood. Nevertheless, spread in the changes of the cloud radiative effect has been shown to have an impact , although the effect is less important for precipitation than it is for the climate sensitivity estimate . The lapse rate plus water vapour feedback and the response of the surface heat flux , the shortwave absorption by water vapour  or by aerosols, have been also identified as important factors. Global precipitation sensitivity estimates from observations are very sensitive to the data and the time period considered. Some	0
Figure 12.7 | Percentage changes over the 21st century in global, land and ocean precipitation per degree Celsius of global warming in CMIP5 model concentration-driven projections for the four RCP scenarios. Annual mean changes are calculated for each year between 2006 and 2100 from one ensemble member per model relative to its mean precipitation and temperature for the 1986-2005 baseline period, and the gradient of a least-squares fit through the annual data is derived. Land and ocean derived values use global mean temperature in the denominator of dP/dT. Each coloured symbol represents a different model, the same symbol being used for the same model for different RCPs and larger black squares being the multi-model mean. Also shown for comparison are global mean results for ENSEMBLES model concentrations-driven projections for the E1 and A1B scenarios , in this case using a leastsquares fit derived over the period 2000-2099 and taking percentage changes relative to the 1980-1999 baseline period. Changes of precipitation over land and ocean are discussed in Section 12.4.5.2.	0
models have simulated all scenarios. To test the effect of undersampling, and to generate a consistent set of uncertainties across scenarios, a step response method that estimates the total warming as sum of responses to small forcing steps  is used to emulate 23 CMIP5 models under the different scenarios . This provides means and ranges  that are comparable across scenarios . See also Section 12.4.9 for a discussion focussed on the differences between CMIP3 and CMIP5 projections of global average temperature changes. For the CO2 concentration-driven simulations , the dominant driver of uncertainty in projections of global temperature for the higher RCPs beyond 2050 is the transient climate response , for RCP2.6, which is closer to equilibrium by the end of the century, it is both the TCR and the equilibrium climate sensitivity . In a transient situation, the ratio of temperature to forcing is approximately constant and scenario independent . Therefore, the uncertainty in TCR maps directly into the uncertainty in global temperature projections for the RCPs other than RCP2.6. The assessed likely range of TCR based on various lines of evidence  is similar to the 5 to 95% percentile range of TCR in CMIP5. In addition, the assessed likely range of ECS is also consistent with the CMIP5 range . There is little evidence that the CMIP5 models are significantly over- or underestimating the RF. The RF uncertainty is small compared to response uncertainty , and is considered by treating the 5 to 95% as a likely rather than very likely range. Kuhlbrodt and Gregory  suggest that models might be overestimating ocean heat uptake, as previously suggested by Forest et al. , but observationally constrained estimates of TCR are unaffected by that. The ocean heat uptake efficiency does not contribute much to the spread of TCR .	0
12.4.1.2 Uncertainties in Global Quantities Uncertainties in global mean quantities arise from variations in internal natural variability, model response and forcing pathways. Table 12.2 gives two measures of uncertainty in the CMIP5 model projections, the standard deviation and the 5 to 95% range across the ensemble's distribution. Because CMIP5 was not designed to explore fully the uncertainty range in projections , neither its standard deviation nor its range can be interpreted directly as an uncertainty statement about the corresponding real quantities, and other techniques and arguments to assess uncertainty in future projections must be considered. Figure 12.8 summarizes the uncertainty ranges in global mean temperature changes at the end of the 21st century under the various scenarios quantified by various methods. Individual CMIP5 models are shown by red crosses. Red bars indicate mean and 5 to 95% percentiles based on assuming a normal distribution for the CMIP5 sample . Estimates from the simple climate carbon cycle Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas-Induced Climate Change  calibrated to C4MIP  carbon cycle models, assuming a PDF for climate sensitivity that corresponds to the assessment of IPCC AR4 , are given as yellow bars . Note that not all	0
Therefore, for global mean temperature projections only, the 5 to 95% range  of the CMIP5 projections can also be interpreted as a likely range for future temperature change between about 2050 and 2100. Confidence in this assessment is high for the end of the century because the warming then is dominated by CO2 and the TCR. Confidence is only medium for mid-century when the contributions of RF and initial conditions to the total temperature response uncertainty are larger. The likely ranges are an expert assessment, taking into account many lines of evidence, in much the same way as in AR4 , and are not probabilistic. The likely ranges for 2046-2065 do not take into account the possible influence of factors that lead to near-term  projections of global mean surface temperature  that are somewhat cooler than the 5 to 95% model ranges , because the influence of these factors on longer term projections cannot be quantified. A few recent studies indicate that some of the models with the strongest transient climate response might overestimate the near term warming  , but there is little evidence of whether and how much that affects the long-term warming response. One perturbed physics ensemble combined with observations indicates warming that exceeds the AR4 at the top end but used a relatively short time period of warming 1057	0
 to constrain the models' projections  . GMSTs for 2081-2100  for the CO2 concentration driven RCPs is therefore assessed to likely fall in the range 0.3C to 1.7C , 1.1C to 2.6C , 1.4C to 3.1C , and 2.6C to 4.8C  estimated from CMIP5. Beyond 2100, the number of CMIP5 simulations is insufficient to estimate a likely range. Uncertainties before 2050 are assessed in Section 11.3.2.1.1. The assessed likely range is very similar to the range estimated by the pulse response model, suggesting that the different sample of models for the different RCPs are not strongly affecting the result, and providing further support that this pulse response technique can be used to emulate temperature and ocean heat uptake in Chapter 13 and Section 12.4.9. The results are consistent with the probabilistic results from MAGICC, which for the lower RCPs have a slightly narrower range due to the lack of internal variability in the simple model, and the fact that non-CO2 forcings are treated more homogeneously than in CMIP5 . This is particularly pronounced for RCP2.6 where the CMIP5 range is substantially larger, partly due to the larger fraction of non-CO2 forcings in that scenario.	0
The uncertainty estimate in AR4 for the SRES scenarios was -40% to +60% around the CMIP3 means . That range was asymmetric and wider for the higher scenarios because it included the uncertainty in carbon cycle climate feedbacks. The SRES scenarios are based on the assumption of prescribed emissions, which then translates to uncertainties in concentrations that propagate through to uncertainties in the temperature response. The RCP scenarios assume prescribed concentrations. For scenarios that stabilize  that approach of constant fractional uncertainty underestimates the uncertainty and is no longer applicable, mainly because internal variability has a larger relative contribution to the total uncertainty . For the RCPs, the carbon cycle climate feedback uncertainty is not included because the simulations are driven by concentrations. Furthermore, there is no clear evidence that distribution of CMIP5 global temperature changes deviates from a normal distribution. For most other variables the shape of the distribution is unclear, and standard deviations are simply used as an indication of model spread, not representing a formal uncertainty assessment. Simulations with prescribed CO2 emissions rather than concentrations are only available for RCP8.5  and from MAGICC. The projected temperature change in 2100 is slightly higher and the uncertainty range is wider as a result of uncertainties in the carbon cycle climate feedbacks. The CMIP5 range is consistent with the uncertainty range given in AR4 for SRES A2 in 2100. Further details about emission versus concentration driven simulations are given in Section 12.4.8. In summary, the projected changes in global temperature for 2100 in the RCP scenarios are very consistent with those obtained by CMIP3 for SRES in IPCC AR4  when taking into account the differences in scenarios. The likely uncertainty ranges provided here are similar for RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 but narrower for RCP8.5 compared to AR4. There was no scenario as low as RCP2.6 in AR4. The uncertainties in global temperature projections have not decreased significantly in CMIP5 , but the assessed ranges cannot be 1058	0

compared between AR4 and AR5. The main reason is that uncertainties in carbon cycle feedbacks are not considered in the concentration driven RCPs. In contrast, the likely range in AR4 included those. The assessed likely ranges are therefore narrower for the high RCPs. The differences in the projected warming are largely attributable to the difference in scenarios , and the change in the future and reference period, rather than to developments in modelling since AR4. A detailed comparison between the SRES and RCP scenarios and the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models is given in Section 12.4.9.	0
12.4.2.1 Definition and Use In this chapter we show geographical patterns of projected changes in climate variables according to specific scenarios and time horizons. Alternative scenarios and projection times can be inferred from those shown by using some established approximation methods. This is especially the case for large-scale regional patterns of average temperature and--with additional caveats--precipitation changes. In fact, `pattern scaling' is an approximation that has been explicitly suggested in the description of the RCPs  as a method for deriving impact-relevant regional projections for scenarios that have not been simulated by global and regional climate models. It was first proposed	0
Good et al. , where some land areas in the low latitudes exhibit a nonlinear relation to global average temperature, but, largely, average precipitation change over the remaining regions can be well approximated by a grid-point specific linear function of global average temperature change. It is in the latter quantity that the dependence of the evolution of the change in time on the model  and the forcing  is encapsulated. In analytical terms, it is assumed that the following relation holds: C  = TG c + R  where the symbol x identifies the geographic location  and possibly the time of year . The index t runs along the length of the forcing scenario of interest. TG indicates global average temperature change at time t under this scenario; c is the time-invariant geographic pattern of change per 1C global surface temperature change for the variable of interest  and C  is the actual field of change for that variable at the specific time t under this scenario. The R  is a residual term and highlights the fact that pattern scaling cannot reconstruct model behaviour with complete accuracy due to both natural variability and because of limitations of the methodology discussed below. This way, regionally and temporally differentiated results under different scenarios or climate sensitivities can be approximated by the product of a spatial pattern, constant over time, scenario and model characteristics, and a time evolving global mean change in temperature. Model and scenario dependence are thus captured through the global mean temperature response, and simple climate models calibrated against fully coupled climate models can be used to simulate the latter, at a great saving in computational cost. The spatial pattern can be estimated through the available coupled model simulations under the assumption that it does not depend on the specific scenario used.	0
The choice of the pattern in the studies available in the literature can be as simple as the ensemble average field of change , normalized by the corresponding change in global average temperature, choosing a segment of the simulations when the signal has emerged from the noise of natural variability from a baseline of reference  and taking the difference of two multi-decadal means. Similar properties and results have been obtained using more sophisticated multivariate procedures that optimize the variance explained by the pattern . The validity of this approximation is discussed by Mitchell et al.  and Mitchell . Huntingford and Cox  evaluate the quality of the approximation for numerous variables, showing that the technique performs best for temperature, downward longwave radiation, relative humidity, wind speeds and surface pressure while showing relatively larger limitations for rainfall rate anomalies. Joshi et al.  have recently shown that the accuracy of the approximation, especially across models, is improved by adding a second term, linear in the land-sea surface warming ratio, another quantity that can be easily estimated from existing coupled climate model simulations. There exist of course differences between the patterns generated by different GCMs (documented for example 1060	0
for CMIP3 in Watterson and Whetton, 2011b), but uncertainty can be characterized, for example, by the inter-model spread in the pattern c. Recent applications of the methodology to probabilistic future projections have in fact sought to fully quantify errors introduced by the approximation, on the basis of the available coupled model runs . Pattern scaling and its applications have been documented in IPCC WGI Reports before . It has been used extensively for regional temperature and precipitation change projections, for example, Murphy et al. , , Giorgi , Harris et al. , May , Ruosteenoja et al. , Raisanen and Ruokolainen , Cabre et al.  and impact studies, for example, as described in Dessai et al.  and Fowler et al. . Recent studies have focussed on patterns linked to warming at certain global average temperature change thresholds  and patterns derived under the RCPs . There are basic limitations to this approach, besides a degradation of its performance as the regional scale of interest becomes finer and in the presence of regionally specific forcings. Recent work with MIROC3.2  has revealed a dependence of the precipitation sensitivity  on the scenario, due to the precipitation being more sensitive to carbon aerosols than WMGHGs. In fact, there are significant differences in black and organic carbon aerosol forcing between the emission scenarios investigated by Shiogama et al. . Levy II et al.  confirm that patterns of precipitation change are spatially correlated with the sources of aerosol emissions, in simulations where the indirect effect is represented. This is a behaviour that is linked to a more general limitation of pattern scaling, which breaks down if aerosol forcing is significant. The effects of aerosols have a regional nature and are thus dependent on the future sources of pollution which are likely to vary geographically in the future and are difficult to predict . For example, Asian and North American aerosol production are likely to have different time histories and future projections. Schlesinger et al.  extended the methodology of pattern scaling by isolating and recombining patterns derived by dedicated experiments with a coupled climate model where sulphate aerosols were increased for various regions in turn. More recently, in an extension of pattern scaling into a probabilistic treatment of model, scenario and initial condition uncertainties, Frieler et al.  derived joint probability distributions for regionally averaged temperature and precipitation changes as linear functions of global average temperature and additional predictors including regionally specific sulphate aerosol and black carbon emissions. Pattern scaling is less accurate for strongly mitigated stabilization scenarios. This has been shown recently by May , comparing patterns of temperature change under a scenario limiting global warming since pre-industrial times to 2C and patterns produced by a scenario that reaches 4.5C of global average temperature change. The limitations of pattern scaling in approximating changes while the climate system approaches equilibrium have found their explanation in Manabe and Wetherald  and Mitchell et al. . Both studies point out that as the temperatures of the deep oceans reach equilibri-	0
um  the geographical distribution of warming changes as well, for example, showing a larger warming of the high latitudes in the SH than in the earlier periods of the transient response, relative to the global mean warming. More recently, Held et al.  showed how this slow warming pattern is in fact present during the initial transient response of the system as well, albeit with much smaller amplitude. Further, Gillett et al.  show how in a simulation in which emissions cease, regional temperatures and precipitation patterns exhibit ongoing changes, even though global mean temperature remains almost constant. Wu et al.  showed that the global precipitation response shows a nonlinear response to strong mitigation scenarios, with the hydrological cycle continuing to intensify even after atmospheric CO2 concentration, and thus global average temperature, start decreasing. Regional nonlinear responses to mitigation scenarios of precipitation and sea surface temperatures  are shown by Chadwick et al. . Other areas where pattern scaling shows a lack of robustness are the edges of polar ice caps and sea ice extent, where at an earlier time in the simulation ice melts and regions of sharp gradient surface, while later in the simulation, in the absence of ice, the gradient will become less steep. Different sea ice representations in models also make the location of such regions much less robust across the model ensembles and the scenarios.	0
12.4.2.2 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Patterns Scaled by Global Average Temperature Change On the basis of CMIP5 simulations, we show geographical patterns  of warming and precipitation change and indicate measures of their variability across models and across RCPs. The patterns are scaled to 1C global mean surface temperature change above the reference period 1986-2005 for 2081-2100  and for a period of approximate stable temperature, 2181-2200  . Spatial correlation of fields of temperature and precipitation change range from 0.93 to 0.99 when considering ensemble means under different RCPs. The lower values are found when computing correlation between RCP2.6 and the higher RCPs, and may be related to the high mitigation	0
Figure 12.10 | Temperature  and precipitation  change patterns derived from transient simulations from the CMIP5 ensembles, scaled to 1C of global mean surface temperature change. The patterns have been calculated by computing 20-year averages at the end of the 21st  and 22nd  centuries and over the period 1986-2005 for the available simulations under all RCPs, taking their difference  and normalizing it, grid-point by grid-point, by the corresponding value of global average temperature change for each model and scenario. The normalized patterns have then been averaged across models and scenarios. The colour scale represents degrees Celsius  and percent  per 1C of global average temperature change. Stippling indicates where the mean change averaged over all realizations is larger than the 95% percentile of the distribution of models. Zonal means of the geographical patterns are shown for each individual model for RCP2.6 , 4.5 , 6.0  and 8.5 . RCP8.5 is excluded from the stabilization figures. The RCP2.6 simulation of the FIO-ESM  model was excluded because it did not show any warming by the end of the 21st century, thus not complying with the method requirement that the pattern be estimated at a time when the temperature change signal from CO2 increase has emerged.	0
enacted under RCP2.6 from early in the 21st century. Pattern correlation varies between 0.91 and 0.98 for temperature and between 0.91 and 0.96 for precipitation when comparing patterns computed by averaging and normalizing changes at the end of the 21st, 22nd and 23rd centuries, with the largest value representing the correlation between the patterns at the end of the 22nd and 23rd centuries, the lowest representing the correlation between the pattern at the end of the 21st and the pattern at the end of the 23rd century. The zonal means shown to the side of each plot represent each model by one line, colour coding the four different scenarios. They show good agreement of models and scenarios over low and mid-latitudes for temperature, but higher spread across models and especially across scenarios for the areas subject to polar amplification, for which the previous discussion about the sensitivity of the patterns to the sea ice edge may be relevant. A comparison of the mean of the lines to their spread indicates overall the presence of a strong mean signal with respect to the spread of the ensemble. Precipitation shows an opposite pattern of inter-model spread, with larger variations in the low latitudes and around the equator, and smaller around the high latitudes. Precipitation has also a lower signal-to-noise ratio .	0
As already mentioned, although we do not explicitly use pattern scaling in the sections that follow, we consider it a useful approximation when the need emerges to interpolate or extrapolate results to different scenarios or time periods, noting the possibility that the scaling may break down at higher levels of global warming, and that the validity of the approximation is limited to broad patterns of change, as opposed to local scales. An important caveat is that pattern scaling only applies to the climate response that is externally forced. The actual response is a combination of forced change and natural variability, which is not and should not be scaled up or down by the application of this technique, which becomes important on small spatial scales and shorter time scales, and whose relative magnitude compared to the forced component also depends on the variable  . One approach to produce projections that include both components is to estimate natural variability separately, scale the forced response and add the two.	0
2013). The phenomenon is predominantly a feature of the surface and lower atmosphere . Studies have found it occurs due to contrasts in surface sensible and latent fluxes over land , land-ocean contrasts in boundary layer lapse rate changes , boundary layer relative humidity and associated low-level cloud cover changes over land  and soil moisture reductions  under climate change. The land-sea warming contrast is also sensitive to aerosol forcing . Globally averaged warming over land and ocean is identified separately in Table 12.2 for the CMIP5 models and the ratio of land to ocean warming is likely in the range of 1.4 to 1.7, consistent with previous studies . The CMIP5 multi-model mean ratio is approximately constant from 2020 through to 2100 . Amplified surface warming in Arctic latitudes is also a consistent feature in climate model integrations . This is often referred to as polar amplification, although numerous studies have shown that under transient forcing, this is primarily an Arctic phenomenon . The lack of an amplified transient warming response in high Southern polar latitudes has been associated with deep ocean mixing, strong ocean heat uptake and the persistence of the vast Antarctic ice sheet. In equilibrium simulations, amplified warming occurs in both polar regions.	0
On an annual average, and depending on the forcing scenario , the CMIP5 models show a mean Arctic  warming between 2.2 and 2.4 times the global average warming for 2081-2100 compared to 1986-2005. Similar polar amplification factors occurred in earlier coupled model simulations . This factor in models is slightly higher than the observed central value, but it is within the uncertainty of the best estimate from observations of the recent past . The uncertainty is large in the observed factor because station records are short and sparse  and the forced signal is contaminated by the noise of internal variability. By contrast, model trends in surface air temperature are 2.5 to 5 times higher than observed over Antarctica, but here also the observational estimates have a very large uncertainty, so, for example, the CMIP3 ensemble mean is consistent with observations within error estimates . Moreover, recent work suggests more widespread current West Antarctic surface warming than previously estimated .	0
Patterns of surface air temperature change for various RCPs show widespread warming during the 21st century . A key feature that has been present throughout the history of coupled modelling is the larger warming over land compared to oceans, which occurs in both transient and equilibrium climate change . The degree to which warming is larger over land than ocean is remarkably constant over time under transient warming due to WMGHGs  suggesting that heat capacity differences between land and ocean do not play a major role in the land-sea warming contrast (Sutton et al., 2007; Joshi et al., 2008,	0
. This is in agreement with recent observations  but contrary to an earlier study that suggested a larger warming aloft . The discrepancy in observed vertical structure may reflect inadequacies in data sets  and sensitivity to the time period used for averaging . As also discussed in Box 5.1, there are many mechanisms that contribute to Arctic amplification, some of which were identified in early modelling studies . Feedbacks associated with changes in sea ice and snow amplify surface warming near the poles . The longwave radiation changes in the top of the atmosphere associated with surface warming opposes surface warming at all latitudes, but less so in the Arctic . Rising temperature globally is expected to increase the hori-	0
zontal latent heat transport by the atmosphere into the Arctic , which warms primarily the lower troposphere. On average, CMIP3 models simulate enhanced latent heat transport , but north of about 65N, the sensible heat transport declines enough to more than offset the latent heat transport increase . Increased atmospheric heat transport into the Arctic and subsidence warming has been associated with a teleconnection driven by enhanced convection in the tropical western Pacific . Ocean heat transport plays a role in the simulated Arctic amplification, with both large late 20th century transport  and increases over the 21st century  associated with higher amplification. As noted by Held and Soden , Kay et al. , and Alexeev and Jackson , diagnosing the role of various factors in amplified warming is complicated by coupling in the system in which local feedbacks interact with poleward heat transports. 1063	0
Although models consistently exhibit Arctic amplification as global mean temperatures rise, the multitude of physical processes described above mean that they differ considerably in the magnitude. Previous work has implicated variations across climate models in numerous factors including inversion strength , ocean heat transport , albedo feedback , longwave radiative feedbacks  and shortwave cloud feedback  as playing a role in the across-model scatter in polar amplification. The magnitude of amplification is generally higher in models with less extensive late 20th century sea ice in June, suggesting that the initial ice state influences the 21st century Arctic amplification. The pattern of simulated Arctic warming is also associated with the initial ice state, and in particular with the location of the winter sea ice edge . This relationship has been suggested as a constraint on projected Arctic warming , although, in general, the ability of models to reproduce observed climate and its trends is not a sufficient condition for attributing high confidence to the projection of future trends .	0
Minima in surface warming occur in the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans under transient forcing in part due to deep ocean mixed layers in those regions . Trenberth and Fasullo  find that the large biases in the Southern Ocean energy budget in CMIP3 coupled models negatively correlate with equilibrium climate sensitivity , suggesting that an improved mean state in the Southern Ocean is needed before warming there can be understood. In the equatorial Pacific, warming is enhanced in a narrow band which previous assessments have described as `El Nino-like', as may be expected from the projected decrease in atmospheric tropical circulations . However, DiNezio et al.  highlight that the tropical Pacific warming in the CMIP3 models is not `El Nino-like' as the pattern of warming and associated teleconnections  is quite distinct from that of an El Nino event. Instead the pattern is of enhanced equatorial warming and is due to a meridional minimum in evaporative damping on the equator  and ocean dynamical changes that can be decoupled from atmospheric changes  . In summary, there is robust evidence over multiple generations of models and high confidence in these large-scale warming patterns. In the absence of a strong reduction in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation , there is very high confidence that the Arctic region is projected to warm most.	0
discussed in Section 12.4.3.1. The tropospheric patterns are similar to those in the TAR and AR4 with the RCP8.5 changes being up to several degrees warmer in the tropics compared to the A1B changes appearing in the AR4. Similar tropospheric patterns appear in the RCP 2.6 and 4.5 changes, but with reduced magnitudes, suggesting some degree of scaling with forcing change in the troposphere, similar to behaviour discussed in the AR4 and Section 12.4.2. The consistency of tropospheric patterns over multiple generations of models indicates high confidence in these projected changes. In the stratosphere, the models show similar tropical patterns of change, with magnitudes differing according to the degree of climate forcing. Substantial differences appear in polar regions. In the north, RCP8.5 and 4.5 yield cooling, though it is more significant in the RCP8.5 ensemble. In contrast, RCP2.6 shows warming, albeit weak and with little significance. In the southern polar region, RCP 2.6 and 4.5 both show significant warming, and RCP8.5 is the outlier, with significant cooling. The polar stratospheric warming, especially in the SH, is similar to that found by Butchart et al.  and Meehl et al.  in GCM simulations that showed effects of ozone recovery in determining the patterns . Eyring et al.  find behaviour in the CMIP5 ensemble both for models with and without interactive chemistry that supports the contention that the polar stratospheric changes in Figure 12.12 are strongly influenced by ozone recovery. Overall, the stratospheric temperature changes do not exhibit pattern scaling with global temperature change and are dependent on ozone recovery. Away from the polar stratosphere, there is physical and pattern consistency in temperature changes between different generations of models assessed here and in the TAR and AR4. The consistency is especially clear in the northern high latitudes and, coupled with physical understanding, indicates that some of the greatest warming is very likely to occur here. There is also consistency across generations of models in relatively large warming in the tropical upper troposphere. Allen and Sherwood  and Johnson and Xie  have presented dynamic and thermodynamic arguments, respectively, for the physical robustness of the tropical behaviour. However, there remains uncertainty about the magnitude of warming simulated in the tropical upper troposphere because large observational uncertainties and contradictory analyses limit a confident assessment of model accuracy in simulating temperature trends in the tropical upper troposphere . The combined evidence indicates that relatively large warming in the tropical upper troposphere is likely, but with medium confidence.	0
12.4.3.3 Temperature Extremes As the climate continues to warm, changes in several types of temperature extremes have been observed , and are expected to continue in the future in concert with global warming . Extremes occur on multiple time scales, from a single day or a few consecutive days  to monthly and seasonal events. Extreme temperature events are often defined by indices , for example, percentage of days in a year when maximum temperature is above the 90th percentile of a present day distribution or by long period return values. Although changes in temperature extremes are a very robust	0
signature of anthropogenic climate change , the magnitude of change and consensus among models varies with the characteristics of the event being considered  as well as the definition used to describe the extreme. Since the AR4 many advances have been made in establishing global observed records of extremes  against which models can be evaluated to give context to future projections . Numerous regional assessments of future changes in extremes have also been performed and a comprehensive summary of these is given in Seneviratne et al. . Here we summarize the key findings from this report and assess updates since then. It is virtually certain that there will be more hot and fewer cold extremes as global temperature increases (Caesar and Lowe, 2012; Orlowsky	0
and Seneviratne, 2012; Sillmann et al., 2013), consistent with previous assessments . Figure 12.13 shows multi-model mean changes in the absolute temperature indices of the coldest day of the year and the hottest day of the year and the threshold-based indices of frost days and tropical nights from the CMIP5 ensemble . A robust increase in warm temperature extremes and decrease in cold temperature extremes is found at the end of the 21st century, with the magnitude of the changes increasing with increased anthropogenic forcing. The coldest night of the year undergoes larger increases than the hottest day in the globally averaged time series . This tendency is consistent with the CMIP3 model results shown in Figure 12.13, which use different models and the SRES scenarios  for earlier CMIP3 results). Similarly, increases in the frequency of warm nights are greater than increases in the frequency of warm days . Regionally, the largest increases in the coldest night of the year are projected in the high latitudes of 1065	0
the NH under the RCP8.5 scenario . The subtropics and mid-latitudes exhibit the greatest projected changes in the hottest day of the year, whereas changes in tropical nights and the frequency of warm days and warm nights are largest in the tropics . The number of frost days declines in all regions while significant increases in tropical nights are seen in southeastern North America, the Mediterranean and central Asia. It is very likely that, on average, there will be more record high than record cold temperatures in a warmer average climate. For example, Meehl et al.  find that the current ratio of 2 to 1 for record daily high maxima to low minima over the USA becomes approximately 20 to 1 by the mid-21st century and 50 to 1 by late century in their model simulation of the SRES A1B scenario. However, even at the end of the century daily record low minima continue to be broken, if in a small number, consistent with Kodra et al. , who conclude that cold extremes will continue to occur in a warmer climate, even though their frequency will decline.	0
It is also very likely that heat waves, defined as spells of days with temperature above a threshold determined from historical climatology, will occur with a higher frequency and duration, mainly as a direct consequence of the increase in seasonal mean temperatures . Changes in the absolute value of temperature extremes are also very likely and expected to regionally exceed global temperature increases by far, with substantial changes in hot extremes projected even for moderate  average warming levels . These changes often differ from the mean temperature increase, as a result of changes in variability and shape of the temperature distribution . For example, summer temperature extremes over central and southern Europe are projected to warm substantially more than the corresponding mean local temperatures as a result of enhanced temperature variability at interannual to intraseasonal time scales . Several recent studies have also argued that the probability of occurrence of a Russian heat wave at least as severe as the one in 2010 increases substantially  along with increasing mean temperatures and enhanced temperature variability . Since the AR4, an increased understanding of mechanisms and feedbacks leading to projected changes in extremes has been gained . Climate models suggest that hot extremes are amplified by soil moisture-temperature feedbacks  in northern mid-latitude regions as the climate warms, consistent with previous assessments. Changes in temperature extremes may also be impacted by changes in land-sea contrast, with Watterson et al.  showing an amplification of southern Australian summer warm extremes over the mean due to anomalous temperature advection from warmer continental interiors. The largest increases in the magnitude of warm extremes are simulated over mid-latitude continental areas, consistent 1066	0
with the drier conditions, and the associated reduction in evaporative cooling from the land surface projected over these areas . The representation of the latter constitutes a major source of model uncertainty for projections of the absolute magnitude of temperature extremes . Winter cold extremes also warm more than the local mean temperature over northern high latitudes  as a result of reduced temperature variability related to declining snow cover  and decreases in land-sea contrast . Changes in atmospheric circulation, induced by remote surface heating can also modify the temperature distribution . Sillmann and Croci-Maspoli  note that cold winter extremes over Europe are in part driven by atmospheric blocking and changes to these blocking patterns in the future lead to changes in the frequency and spatial distribution of cold temperature extremes as global temperatures increase. Occasional cold winters will continue to occur . Human discomfort, morbidity and mortality during heat waves depend not only on temperature but also specific humidity. Heat stress, defined as the combined effect of temperature and humidity, is expected to increase along with warming temperatures and dominates the local decrease in summer relative humidity due to soil drying . Areas with abundant atmospheric moisture availability and high present-day temperatures such as Mediterranean coastal regions are expected to experience the greatest heat stress changes because the heat stress response scales with humidity which thus becomes increasingly important to heat stress at higher temperatures . For some regions, simulated heat stress indicators are remarkably robust, because those models with stronger warming simulate a stronger decrease in atmospheric relative humidity . Changes in rare temperature extremes can be assessed using extreme value theory based techniques . Kharin et al. , in an analysis of CMIP3 models, found large increases in the 20-year return values of the annual maximum and minimum daily averaged surface air temperatures  with larger changes over land than ocean. Figure 12.14 displays the end of 21st century change in the magnitude of these rare events from the CMIP5 models in the RCP2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios . Comparison to the changes in summer mean temperature shown in Figure AI.5 and A1.7 of Annex I Supplementary Material reveals that rare high temperature events are projected to change at rates similar to or slightly larger than the summertime mean temperature in many land areas. However, in much of Northern Europe 20-year return values of daily high temperatures are projected to increase 2C or more than JJA mean temperatures under RCP8.5, consistent with previous studies . Rare low temperature events are projected to experience significantly larger increases than the mean in most land regions, with a pronounced effect at high latitudes. Twenty-year return values of cold extremes increase s ignificantly more than	1

winter mean temperature changes, particularly over parts of North America and Europe. Kharin et al.  concluded from the CMIP5 models that it is likely that in most land regions a current 20 year maximum temperature event is projected to become a one-in-two-year event by the end of the 21st century under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, except for some regions of the high latitudes of the NH where it is likely to become a one-in-five-year event  Figure 3.5). Current 20-year minimum temperature events are projected to become exceedingly rare, with return periods likely increasing to more than 100 years in almost all locations under RCP8.5 . Section 10.6.1.1 notes that a number of detection and attribution studies since SREX suggest that the model changes may tend to be too large for warm extremes and too small for cold extremes and thus these likelihood statements are somewhat less strongly stated than a direct interpretation of model output and	0
12.4.3.4 Energy Budget Anthropogenic or natural perturbations to the climate system produce RFs that result in an imbalance in the global energy budget at the top of the atmosphere  and affect the global mean temperature . The climate responds to a change in RF on multiple time scales and at multiyear time scales the energy imbalance  is very close to the ocean heat uptake due to the much lower thermal inertia of the atmosphere and the continental surfaces . The radiative responses of the fluxes at TOA are generally analysed using the forcing-feedback framework and are presented in Section 9.7.2.	0
imbalance is always less than the RF because of the slow rate of ocean heat uptake.) The rapid fluctuations that are simulated during the 20th century originate from volcanic eruptions that are prescribed in the models . These aerosols reflect solar radiation and thus decrease the amount of SW radiation absorbed by the Earth . The minimum of shortwave  radiation absorbed by the Earth during the period 1960-2000 is due mainly to two factors: a sequence of volcanic eruptions and an increase of the reflecting aerosol burden due to human activities . During the 21st century, the absorbed SW radiation monotonically increases for the RCP8.5 scenario, and increases and subsequently stabilizes for the other scenarios, consistent with what has been previously obtained with CMIP3 models and SRES scenarios . The two main contributions to the SW changes are the change of clouds  and the change of the cryosphere  at high latitudes. In the longwave  domain , the net flux at TOA represents the opposite of the flux that is emitted by the Earth's surface and atmosphere toward space, i.e., a negative anomaly represents an increase of the emitted	0

All the fluxes are positive downward and units are W m-2.

Stippling indicates regions where the multi-model mean change is greater than two standard deviations of internal variability and where at least 90% of models agree on the sign of change .	0
LW radiation. The LW net flux depends mainly on two factors: the surface temperature and the magnitude of the greenhouse effect of the atmosphere. During the 20th century, the rapid fluctuations of LW radiation are driven by volcanic forcings, which decrease the absorbed SW radiation, surface temperature, and the LW radiation emitted by the Earth toward space. During the period 1960-2000, the fast increase of GHG concentrations also decreases the radiation emitted by the Earth. In response to this net heating of the Earth, temperatures warm and thereby increase emitted LW radiation although the change of the temperature vertical profile, water vapour, and cloud properties modulate this response .	0
12.4.3.5 Clouds This section provides a summary description of future changes in clouds and their feedbacks on climate. A more general and more precise description and assessment of the role of clouds in the climate system is provided in Chapter 7, in particular Section 7.2 for cloud processes and feedbacks and Section 7.4 for aerosol-cloud interactions. Cloud feedbacks and adjustments are presented in Section 7.2.5 and a synthesis is provided in Section 7.2.6. Clouds are a major component of the climate system and play an important role in climate sensitivity , the diurnal temperature range  over land , and land-sea contrast . The observed global mean cloud RF is about -20 W m-2  , that is, clouds have a net cooling effect. Current GCMs simulate clouds through various complex parameterizations , and cloud feedback is a major source of the spread of the climate sensitivity estimate  .	0
Dufresne, 2005; Webb et al., 2006; Wyant et al., 2006). Since AR4, these results have been confirmed along with the positive feedbacks due to high level clouds in the CMIP3 or CFMIP models  and CMIP5 models . Since AR4, the response of clouds has been partitioned in a direct or `rapid' response of clouds to CO2 and a `slow' response of clouds to the surface temperature increase  . The radiative effect of clouds depends mainly on their fraction, optical depth and temperature. The contribution of these variables to the cloud feedback has been quantified for the multi-model CMIP3  and CFMIP1 database . These findings are consistent with the radiative changes obtained with the CMIP5 models  and may be summarized as follows . The dominant contributor to the SW cloud feedback is the change in cloud fraction. The reduction of cloud fraction between 50S and 50N, except along the equator and the eastern part of the ocean basins , contributes to an increase in the absorbed solar radiation . Physical mechanisms and the role of different parameterizations have been proposed to explain this reduction of low-level clouds . Poleward of 50S, the cloud fraction and the cloud optical depth increases, thereby increasing cloud reflectance. This leads to a decrease of solar absorption around Antarctica where the ocean is nearly ice free in summer . However, there is low confidence in this result because GCMs do not reproduce the nearly 100% cloud cover observed there and the negative feedback could be overestimated  or, at the opposite, underestimated because the cloud optical depth simulated by models is biased high there . In the LW domain, the tropical high cloud changes exert the dominant effect. A lifting of the cloud top with warming is simulated consistently across models  which leads to a positive feedback whereby the LW emissions from high clouds decrease as they cool . The dominant driver of this effect is the increase of tropopause height and physical explanations have been proposed (Hartmann and Larson, 2002; Lorenz and DeWeaver, 2007; Zelinka	0
and Hartmann, 2010). Although the decrease in cloudiness generally increases outgoing longwave radiation and partly offsets the effect of cloud rising, the net effect is a consistent positive global mean LW cloud feedback across CMIP and CFMIP models. Global mean SW cloud feedbacks range from slightly negative to strongly positive , with an inter-model spread in net cloud feedback being mainly attributable to low-level cloud changes. In summary, both the multi-model mean and the inter-model spread of the cloud fraction and radiative flux changes simulated by the CMIP5 models are consistent with those previously obtained by the CMIP3 models. These include decreases in cloud amount in the subtropics, increases at high latitudes and increases in the altitude of high level clouds in convective regions. Many of these changes have been understood primarily as responses to large-scale circulation changes .	0
Projected changes in energy and water cycles couple with changes in atmospheric circulation and mass distribution. Understanding this coupling is necessary to assess physical behaviour underlying projected changes, particularly at regional scales, revealing why changes occur and the realism of the changes. The focus in this section is on atmospheric circulation behaviour that CMIP5 GCMs resolve well. Thus, the section includes discussion of extratropical cyclones but not tropical cyclones: extratropical cyclones are fairly well resolved by most CMIP5 GCMs, whereas tropical cyclones are not, requiring resolutions finer than used by the large majority of CMIP5 GCMs . Detailed discussion of tropical cyclones appears in Section 14.6.1 ). Regional detail concerning extratropical storm tracks, including causal processes, appears in Section 14.6.2	0
12.4.4.1 Mean Sea Level Pressure and Upper-Air Winds Sea level pressure gives an indication of surface changes in atmospheric circulation . As in previous assessments, a robust feature of the pattern of change is a decrease in high latitudes and increases in the mid-latitudes, associated with poleward shifts in the SH mid-latitude storm tracks  and positive trends in the annular modes  as well as an expansion of the Hadley Cell . Similar patterns of sea level pressure change are found in observed trends over recent decades, suggesting an already detectable change , although the observed patterns are influenced by both natural and anthropogenic forcing as well as internal variability and the relative importance of these influences is likely to change in the future. Internal variability has been found to play a large role in uncertainties of future sea level pressure projections, particularly at higher latitudes . In boreal winter, decreases of sea level pressure over NH high latitudes are slightly weaker in the CMIP5 ensemble compared to previous assessments, consistent with Scaife et al.  and Karpechko and Manzini , who suggest that improvements in the representation of the stratosphere can influence this pattern. In austral summer, the SH projections are impacted by the additional influence of stratospheric ozone recovery  which opposes changes due to GHGs. Under the weaker GHG emissions of RCP2.6, decreases in sea level pressure over the SH mid-latitudes and increases over SH high latitudes are consistent with expected changes from ozone recovery . For	0
Future changes in zonal and annual mean zonal winds  are seen throughout the atmosphere with stronger changes in higher RCPs. Large increases in winds are evident in the tropical stratosphere and a poleward shift and intensification of the SH tropospheric jet is seen under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, associated with an increase in the SH upper tropospheric meridional temperature gradient  . In the NH, the response of the tropospheric jet is weaker and complicated by the additional thermal forcing of polar amplification . Barnes and Polvani  evaluate changes in the annual mean mid-latitude jets in the CMIP5 ensemble, finding consistent poleward shifts in both hemispheres under RCP8.5 for the end of the 21st century. In the NH, the poleward shift is ~1, similar to that found for the CMIP3 ensemble . In the SH, the annual mean mid-latitude jet shifts poleward by ~2 under RCP8.5 at the end of the 21st century in the CMIP5 multi-model mean , with a similar shift of 1.5 in the surface westerlies . A strengthening of the SH surface westerlies is also found under all RCPs except RCP2.6 , with largest changes in the Pacific basin . In austral summer, ozone recovery offsets changes in GHGs to some extent, with a weak reversal of the jet 1072	0
shift found in the multi-model mean under the low emissions scenario of RCP2.6  and weak or poleward shifts in other RCPs . Eyring et al.  note the sensitivity of the CMIP5 SH summertime circulation changes to both the strength of the ozone recovery  and the rate of GHG increases. Although the poleward shift of the tropospheric jets are robust across models and likely under increased GHGs, the dynamical mechanisms behind these projections are still not completely understood and have been explored in both simple and complex models . The shifts are associated with a strengthening in the upper tropospheric meridional temperature gradient  and hypotheses for associated changes in planetary wave activity and/or synoptic eddy characteristics that impact on the position of the jet have been put forward . Equatorward biases in the position of the SH jet , while somewhat improved over similar biases in the CMIP3 models  still remain, limiting our confidence in the magnitude of future changes. In summary, poleward shifts in the mid-latitude jets of about 1 to 2 degrees latitude are likely at the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 in both hemispheres  with weaker shifts in the NH and under lower emission scenarios. Ozone recovery will likely weaken the GHG-induced changes in the SH extratropical circulation in austral summer.	0
changes in tropical atmospheric circulation are assessed in Section 2.7.5, while Section 10.3.3 discusses attribution of these observed changes to anthropogenic forcing. Evidence is inconclusive on recent trends in the strength of the Hadley  and Walker Circulations , though there is medium confidence of an anthropogenic influence on the observed widening of the Hadley Circulation . In the projections, there are indications of a weakening of tropical overturning of air as the climate warms . In the SRES A1B scenario, CMIP3 models show a remarkable agreement in simulating a weakening of the tropical atmospheric overturning circulation . CMIP5 models also show a consistent weakening . Along the ascending branches of tropical overturning cells, a reduction in convective mass flux from the boundary layer to the free atmosphere is implied by the differential response to global warming of the boundary-layer moisture content and surface evaporation. This weakening of vertical motion along the ascending regions of both the tropical meridional and near-equatorial zonal cells is associated with an imbalance in the rate of atmospheric moisture increase and that of global mean precipitation . A reduction in the compensating climatological subsidence along the downward branches of overturning circulations, where the rate of increase of static stability exceeds radiative cooling, is implied. Several mechanisms have been suggested for the changes in the intensity of the tropical overturning circulation. The weakening of low-level convective mass flux along ascending regions of tropical overturning cells has been ascribed to changes in the hydrologic cycle . Advection of dry air from subsidence regions towards the ascending branches of large-scale tropical circulation has been suggested to be a feasible mechanism weakening ascent along the edges of convection regions . A deepening of the tropical troposphere in response to global warming increases the vertical extent of convection, which has been shown to increase the atmosphere's moist stability and thus also weakening overturning cells . An imbalance between the increase in diabatic heating of the troposphere and in static stability whereby the latter increases more rapidly has also been thought to play a role in weakening tropical ascent . Mean advection of enhanced vertical stratification under GHG forcing which involves cooling of convective regions and warming of subsidence regions has been shown to slow down tropical cells . The latest findings using CMIP5 models reveal that an increase in GHGs  contributes significantly to weakening tropical overturning cells by reducing radiative cooling in the upper atmosphere . SST gradients have also been found to play a role in altering the strength of tropical cells . Evidence has been provided suggesting that the SH Hadley Cell may strengthen in response to meridional SST gradients featuring reduced warming in the SH subtropical oceans relative to the NH, particularly over the Pacific and Indian Oceans . The north-to-south SST warming gradients are a source of intermodel differences in their projections of changes in the SH Hadley Circulation.	0
Apart from changes in Hadley Circulation strength, a robust feature in 21st century climate model simulations is an increase in the cell's depth and width , with the latter change translating to a broadening of tropical regions  and a poleward displacement of subtropical dry zones . The increase in the cell's depth is consistent with a tropical tropopause rise. The projected increase in the height of the tropical tropopause and the associated increase in meridional temperature gradients close to the tropopause slope have been proposed to be an important mechanism behind the Hadley cell expansion and the poleward displacement of the subtropical westerly jet . An increase in subtropical and mid-latitude static stability has been found to be an important factor widening the Hadley Cell by shifting baroclinic eddy activity and the associated eddy-driven jet and subsidence poleward . The projected widening of the Hadley Cell is consistent with late 20th century observations, where ~2 to 5 latitude expansion was found . The consistency of simulated changes in CMIP3 and CMIP5 models and the consistency of Hadley Cell changes with the projected tropopause rise and increase in subtropical and mid-latitude static stability indicate that a widening and weakening of the NH Hadley Cell by the late 21st century is likely. The zonally asymmetric Walker Circulation is projected to weaken under global warming , more than the Hadley Circulation . The consistency of the projected Walker Circulation slowdown from CMIP3 to CMIP5 suggests that its change is robust . Almost everywhere around the equatorial belt, changes in the 500 hPa vertical motion oppose the climatological background motion, notably over the maritime continent . Around the Indo-Pacific warm pool, in response to a spatially uniform SST warming, the climatological upper tropospheric divergence weakens . Changes in the strength of the Walker Circulation also appear to be linked to differential warming between the Indian and Pacific Ocean warming at low latitudes . Over the equatorial Pacific Ocean, where mid-tropospheric ascent is projected to strengthen, changes in zonal SST and hence sea level pressure gradients induce low-level westerly wind anomalies that act to weaken the low-level branch of the Pacific Walker Circulation. These projected changes in the tropical Pacific circulation are already occurring . However, the projected weakening of the Pacific Walker Cell does not imply an increase in the frequency and/or magnitude of El Nino events . The consistency of simulated changes in CMIP3 and CMIP5 models and the consistency of Walker Cell changes with equatorial SST and pressure-gradient changes that are already observed indicate that a weakening of the Walker Cell by the late 21st century is likely. In the upper atmosphere, a robust feature of projected stratospheric circulation change is that the Brewer-Dobson circulation will likely strengthen in the 21st century . In a majority of model experiments, the projected changes in the large-scale overturning circulation in the stratosphere feature an 1073	0
intensification of tropical upward mass flux, which may extend to the upper stratosphere. The proposed driver of the increase in mass flux at the tropical lower stratosphere is the enhanced propagation of wave activity, mainly resolved planetary waves, associated with a positive trend in zonal wind structure . In the 21st century, increases in wave excitation from diabatic heating in the upper tropical troposphere could reinforce the wave forcing on the tropical upwelling branch of the stratospheric mean meridional circulation . Parameterized orographic gravity waves that result from strengthening of subtropical westerly jets and cause more waves to propagate into the lower stratosphere also play a role . The projected intensification in tropical upwelling is counteracted by enhanced mean extratropical/polar lower stratospheric subsidence. In the NH high latitudes, the enhanced downwelling is associated with an increase in stationary planetary wave activities . The intensification of the stratospheric meridional residual circulation has already been reported in studies focussing on the last decades of the 20th century . The projected increase in troposphere-to-stratosphere mass exchange rate  and stratospheric mixing associated with the strengthening of the Brewer-Dobson circulation will likely result in a decrease in the mean age of air in the lower stratosphere. In the mid-latitude lower stratosphere, quasi-horizontal mixing is a significant contributor to reducing the lifetimes of air. There are some suggestions that the changes in stratospheric overturning circulation could lead to a reduction in tropical ozone concentrations and an increase at high latitudes  and an increase in the amplitude of the annual cycle of stratospheric ozone .	0
Since the AR4, there has been continued evaluation of changes in extratropical storm tracks under projected warming using both CMIP3 and, more recently, CMIP5 simulations, as well as supporting studies using single models or idealized simulations. CMIP3 analyses use a variety of methods for diagnosing storm tracks, but diagnosis of changes in the tracks appears to be relatively insensitive to methods used . Analyses of SH storm tracks generally agree with earlier studies, showing that extratropical storm tracks will tend to shift poleward . The behaviour is consistent with a likely trend in observed storm-track behaviour . Similar behaviour appears in CMIP5 simulations for the SH . In SH winter there is a clear poleward shift in storm tracks of several degrees and a reduction in storm frequency of only a few percent . The poleward shift at the end of the century is consistent with a poleward shift in the SH of the latitudes with strongest tropospheric jets . This appears to coincide with shifts in baroclinic dynamics governing extratropical storms , though the degree of jet shift appears to be sensitive to bias in a model's contemporary-climate storm tracks . Although there is thus some uncertainty in the degree of shift, the consistency of behaviour with observation-based trends, consistency 1074	0
between CMIP5 and CMIP3 projections under a variety of diagnostics and the physical consistency of the storm response with other climatic changes gives high confidence that a poleward shift of several degrees in SH storm tracks is likely by the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario. In the NH winter , the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble shows an overall reduced frequency of storms and less indication of a poleward shift in the tracks. The clearest poleward shift in the NH winter at the end of the 21st century occurs in the Asia-Pacific storm track, where intensification of the westerly jet promotes more intense cyclones in an ensemble of CMIP5 models . Otherwise, changes in winter storm-track magnitude, as measured by band-pass sea level pressure fluctuations, show only small change relative to interannual and inter-decadal variability by the end of the 21st century in SRES A1B and RCP4.5 simulations for several land areas over the NH . Consistency in CMIP3 and CMIP5 changes seen in the SH are absent in the NH . Factors identified that affect changes in the North Atlantic basin's storm track include horizontal resolution  and how models simulate changes in the Atlantic's meridional overturning circulation , the zonal jet and Hadley Circulation  and subtropical upper troposphere temperature . Substantial uncertainty and thus low confidence remains in projecting changes in NH winter storm tracks, especially for the North Atlantic basin. Additional analyses of CMIP3 GCMs have determined other changes in properties of extratropical storms. Most analyses find that the frequency of storms decreases in projected climates , though the occurrence of strong storms may increase in some regions . Many studies focus on behaviour of specific regions, and results of these studies are detailed in Section 14.6.2. Changes in extratropical storms in turn may influence other large-scale climatic changes. Kug et al.  in a set of time-slice simulations show that a poleward shift of storm tracks in the NH could enhance polar warming and moistening. The Arctic Oscillation  is sensitive to synoptic eddy vorticity flux, so that projected changes in storm tracks can alter the AO . The net result is that changes in extratropical storms alter the climate in which they are embedded, so that links between surface warming, extratropical storms and their influence on climate are more complex than simple responses to changes in baroclinicity .	0
The water cycle consists of water stored on the Earth in all its phases, along with the movement of water through the Earth's climate system. In the atmosphere, water occurs primarily as gaseous water vapour, but it also occurs as solid ice and liquid water in clouds. The ocean is primarily liquid water, but is partly covered by ice in polar regions. Terrestrial water in liquid form appears as surface water , soil moisture and groundwater.

P rojections of future changes in the water cycle are inextricably connected to changes in the energy cycle  and atmospheric circulation . Saturation vapour pressure increases with temperature, but projected future changes in the water cycle are far more complex than projected temperature changes. Some regions of the world will be subject to decreases in hydrologic activity while others will be subject to increases. There are important local seasonal differences among the responses of the water cycle to climate change as well. At first sight, the water cycles simulated by CMIP3/5 models may appear to be inconsistent, particularly at regional scales. Anthropogenic changes to the water cycle are superimposed on complex naturally varying modes of the climate , AO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation , etc.) aggravating the differences between model projections. However, by careful consideration of the interaction of the water cycle with changes in other aspects of the climate system, the mechanisms of change are revealed, increasing confidence in projections.	0
`a broad-scale, quasi-unchanged RH response  is uncontroversial' . However, underlying this fairly straightforward behaviour are changes in RH that can influence changes in cloud cover and atmospheric convection . More recent analysis provides further detail and insight on RH changes. Analysis of CMIP3 and CMIP5 models shows near-surface RH decreasing over most land areas as temperatures increase with the notable exception of parts of tropical Africa  . The prime contributor to these decreases in RH over land is the larger temperature increases over land than over ocean in the RCP scenarios . The specific humidity of air originating over more slowly warming oceans will be governed by saturation temperatures of oceanic air. As this air moves over land and is warmed, its relative humidity drops as any further moistening of the air over land is insufficient to maintain constant RH, a behaviour Sherwood et al.  term a last-saturation-temperature constraint. The RH decrease over most land areas by the end of the 21st century is consistent with a last-saturation-temperature constraint and with observed behaviour during the first decade of the current century . Land- ocean differences in warming are projected to continue through the 21st century, and although the CMIP5 projected changes are small, they are consistent with a last-saturation constraint, indicating with medium confidence that reductions in near-surface RH over many land areas are likely.	0

projected changes in RCP scenarios. Changes in precipitation extremes are presented in Section 12.4.5.5. Further discussion of regional changes, in particular the monsoon systems, is presented in Chapter 14. Figure 12.22 shows the CMIP5 multi-model average percentage change in seasonal mean precipitation in the middle of the 21st century, at the end of the 21st century and at the end of the 22nd century for the RCP8.5 scenario relative to the 1986-2005 average. Precipitation changes for all the scenarios are shown in Annex I Supplementary Material and scale approximately with the global mean temperature . In many regions, changes in precipitation exhibit strong seasonal characteristics so that, in regions where the sign of the precipitation changes varies with the season, the annual mean values  may hide some of these seasonal changes, resulting in weaker confidence than seasonal mean values . The patterns of multi-model precipitation changes displayed in Figure 12.22 tend to smooth and decrease the spatial contrast of precipitation changes simulated by each model, in particular over regions where model results disagree. Thus the amplitude of the multi-model ensemble mean precipitation response significantly underestimates the median amplitude computed from each individual model . The CMIP3/5 multi-model ensemble precipitation projections must be interpreted in the context of uncertainty. Multi-model projections are not probabilistic statements about the likelihood of changes. Maps of multi-model projected changes are smoothly varying but observed changes are and will continue to be much more granular. To analyze the patterns of projected precipitation changes, a useful framework consists in decomposing them into a part that is related to atmospheric circulation changes and a part that is related mostly to water vapour changes, referred to as dynamical and thermodynamical components, respectively. However, the definition of these two components may differ among studies. At the time of the AR4, the robust changes of the difference between precipitation and evaporation  were interpreted as a wet-get-wetter and dry-get-drier type of response . The theoretical background, which is more relevant over oceans than over land, is that the lower-tropospheric water vapour increase with temperature enhances the moisture transported by the circulation. This leads to additional moisture convergence within the convergence zones and to additional moisture divergence in the descent zones, increasing the contrast in precipitation minus evaporation values between moisture convergence and divergence regions. A weakening of the tropical overturning circulation  partially opposes this thermodynamic response . At the regional scale the dynamic response may be larger than the thermodynamic response, and this has been analyzed in more detail since the AR4 . Over continents, this simple wetget-wetter and dry-get-drier type of response fails for some important regions such as the Amazon. At the global scale, the net water vapour	0
transport from oceans to land increases, and therefore the average P - E over continents also increases . In the mid and high latitudes, a common feature across generations of climate models is a simulated increased precipitation. The thermodynamical component explains most of the projected increase . This is consistent with theoretical explanations assuming fixed atmospheric flow patterns but increased water vapour in the lower troposphere . In addition to this thermodynamical effect, water transport may be modified by the poleward shift of the storm tracks and by the increase of their intensity , although confidence in such changes in storm tracks may not be high . On seasonal time scales, the minimum and maximum values of precipitation both increase, with a larger increase of the maximum and therefore an increase of the annual precipitation range . In particular, the largest changes over northern Eurasia and North America are projected to occur during winter. At high latitudes of the NH, the precipitation increase may lead to an increase of snowfall in the colder regions and a decrease of snowfall in the warmer regions due to the decreased number of freezing days . Most models simulate a large increase of the annual mean precipitation over the equatorial ocean and an equatorward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone , in both summer and winter seasons, that are mainly explained by atmospheric circulation changes . The changes of the atmospheric circulation have different origins. Along the margins of the convection zones, spatial inhomogeneities, including local convergence feedback or the rate at which air masses from dry regions tend to flow into the convection zone, can yield a considerable sensitivity in precipitation response . Along the equator, atmosphere-ocean interactions yield to a maximum of SST warming and a large precipitation increase there . Model studies with idealized configurations suggest that tropical precipitation changes should be interpreted as responses to changes of the atmospheric energy budget rather than responses to changes of SST . All of these atmospheric circulation changes, and therefore precipitation changes, can differ considerably from model to model. This is the case over both ocean and land. For instance, the spread of model projections in the Sahel region, West Africa, is large in both the CMIP3 and CMIP5 multi-model data base . In the subtropical dry regions, there is a robust decrease of P - E that is accounted for by the thermodynamic contribution . Over ocean, the spatial heterogeneity of temperature increase impacts the lower-tropospheric water vapour increase, which impacts both the thermodynamic and the dynamic responses . In addition, the pattern of precipitation changes in dry regions may be different from that of P - E because the contribution of evaporation changes can be as large  as the moisture transport changes . This is especially the case over the subsidence regions during the warm season over land where the 1077	0
agreement between models is the smallest . A robust feature is the decline of precipitation on the poleward flanks of the subtropical dry zones as a consequence of the Hadley Cell expansion, with possible additional decrease from a poleward shift of the mid latitude storm tracks . On seasonal time scales, the minimum and the maximum values of precipitation both increase, with a larger increase of the maximum and therefore an increase of the annual precipitation range . Long-term precipitation changes are driven mainly by the increase of the surface temperature, as presented above, but other factors also contribute to them. Recent studies suggest that CO2 increase has a significant direct influence on atmospheric circulation, and therefore on global and tropical precipitation changes . Over the ocean, the positive RF from increased atmospheric CO2 reduces the radiative cooling	0
of the troposphere and the large scale rising motion and hence reduces precipitation in the convective regions. Over large landmasses, the direct effect of CO2 on precipitation is the opposite owing to the small thermal inertia of land surfaces . Regional precipitation changes are also influenced by aerosol and ozone  through both local and large-scale processes, including changes in the circulation. Stratospheric ozone depletion contributes to the poleward expansion of the Hadley Cell and the related change of precipitation in the SH  whereas black carbon and tropospheric ozone increases are major contributors in the NH . Regional precipitation changes depend on regional forcings and on how models simulate their local and remote effects. Based on CMIP3 results, the inter-model spread of the estimate of precipitation changes over land is larger than the inter-scenario spread except in East Asia .	0
Projected precipitation changes vary greatly between models, much more so than for temperature projections. Part of this variance is due to genuine differences between the models including their ability to replicate observed precipitation patterns . However, a large part of it is also the result of the small ensemble size from each model . This is especially true for regions of small projected changes located between two regions: one experiencing significant increases while the other experiences significant decreases. Individual climate model realizations will differ in their projection of future precipitation changes in these regions simply owing to their internal variability . Multi-model projections containing large numbers of realizations would tend to feature small changes in these regions, and hatching in Figure 12.22 indicates regions where the projected multi-model mean change is less than one standard deviation of internal variability , Box 12.1). Confidence in projections in regions of limited or no change in precipitation may be more difficult to obtain than confidence in regions of large projected changes. However, Power et al.  and Tebaldi et al.  show that for some of the regions featuring small multi-model average projected changes, effective consensus in projections may be better than the metrics reported in AR4 would imply. Since the AR4, progress has been made in the understanding of the processes that control large scale precipitation changes. There is high confidence that the contrast of seasonal mean precipitation between dry and wet regions will increase in a warmer climate over most of the globe although there may be regional exceptions to this general pattern. This response is particularly robust when considering P - E changes as a function of atmospheric dynamical regimes. However, it is important to note that significant exceptions can occur in specific regions especially along the equator and on the poleward edges of the subtropical dry zone. In these regions, atmospheric circulation changes lead to shifts of the precipitation patterns. There is high confidence that the contrast between wet and dry seasons will increase over most of the globe as temperatures increase. Over the mid- and high-latitude regions, projected precipitation increases in winter are larger than in summer. Over most of the subtropical oceans, projected precipitation increases in summer are larger than in winter. The changes in precipitation shown in Figure 12.22 exhibit patterns that become more pronounced and confidence in them increases as temperatures increase. More generally, the spatial and temporal changes in precipitation between two scenarios or within two periods of a given scenario exhibit the pattern scaling behavior and limitations described in Section 12.4.2. The patterns and the associated multi-model spreads in CMIP5 for the RCP scenarios are very similar to those in CMIP3 for the SRES scenarios discussed in the AR4, with the projections in CMIP5 being slightly more consistent over land than those from CMIP3 . The largest percentage changes are at the high latitudes. By the end of the 21st century, over the large northern land masses, increased precipitation is likely under the RCP8.5 scenario in the winter and spring poleward of 50N. The robustness across scenarios, the magnitude of the projected changes versus natural variability and physical explanations described above yield high confidence that the projected changes would be larger than natural 20-year variations . In the tropics, precipitation changes exhibit strong regional contrasts, with increased precipitation	0
over the equatorial Pacific and Indian Oceans and decreases over much of the subtropical ocean. However, decreases are not projected to be larger than natural 20-year variations anywhere until the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Decreased precipitation in the Mediterranean, Caribbean and Central America, southwestern United States and South Africa is likely under the RCP8.5 scenario and is projected with medium confidence to be larger than natural variations by the end of the 22nd century in some seasons . The CMIP3 models' historical simulations of zonal mean precipitation trends were shown to underestimate observed trends  . Therefore it is more likely than not that the magnitude of the projected future changes in Figure 12.22 based on the multi-model mean is underestimated. Observational uncertainties including limited global coverage and large natural variability, in addition to challenges in precipitation modelling, limit confidence in assessment of climatic changes in precipitation.	0
12.4.5.3 Soil Moisture Near-surface soil moisture is the net result of a suite of complex processes , and heterogeneous and difficult-to-characterize aboveground and belowground system properties . As a result, regional to global-scale simulations of soil moisture and drought remain relatively uncertain . The AR4  discussed the lack of assessments of global-scale models in their ability to simulate soil moisture, and this problem appears to have persisted . Furthermore, consistent multi-model projections of total soil moisture are difficult to make owing to substantial differences between climate models in the depth of their soil. However, Koster et al.  argued that once climatological statistics affecting soil moisture were accounted for, different models tend to agree on soil moisture projections. The AR4 summarized multi-model projections of 21st century annual mean soil moisture changes as decreasing in the subtropics and Mediterranean region, and increasing in east Africa and central Asia. Dai  found similar changes in an ensemble of 11 CMIP5 GCMs under RCP4.5. Figure 12.23 shows projected changes in surface soil moisture  in the CMIP5 ensemble at the end of the 21st century under the RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5. We focus on this new CMIP5 specification because it describes soil moisture at a consistent depth across all CMIP5 models. The broad patterns are moderately consistent across the RCPs, with the changes tending to become stronger as the strength of the forcing change increases. The agreement among CMIP5 models and the consistency with other physical features of climate change indicate high confidence in certain regions where surface soils are projected to dry. There is little-to-no confidence anywhere in projections of moister surface soils. Under RCP8.5, with the largest projected change, individual ensemble members  show consistency across the ensemble for drying in the Mediterranean region, northeast and southwest South America, southern Africa, and southwestern USA. However, ensemble members show disagreement on the sign of change in large regions such as central Asia or the high northern latitudes. The Mediterranean, southwestern USA, northeast South America and southern African drying regions are consistent with 1079	0
projected widening of the Hadley Circulation that shifts downwelling, thus inhibiting precipitation in these regions. The large-scale drying in the Mediterranean, southwest USA, and southern Africa appear across generations of projections and climate models and is deemed likely as global temperatures rise and will increase the risk of agricultural drought. In addition, an analysis of CMIP3 and CMIP5 projections of soil moisture in five drought-prone regions indicates that the differences in future forcing scenarios are the largest source of uncertainty in such regions rather than differences between model responses . Other recent assessments include multi-model ensemble approaches, dynamical downscaling, and regional climate models applied around the globe and illustrate the variety of issues influencing soil moisture changes. Analyses of the southwestern USA using CMIP3 models  show consistent projections of drying, primarily due to a decrease in winter precipitation. In contrast, Kellomaki et al.  find that SRES A2 projections for Finland yield decreased snow depth, but soil moisture generally increases, consistent with the general increase in precipitation occurring in high northern latitudes. Kolomyts and Surova , using projections from the CMIP3 models, GISS and HadCM2, under the SRES A2 forcing, show that vegetation type has substantial influence on the development of pronounced drying over the 21st century in Middle Volga Region forests. 1080	0
Projected changes in soil moisture from the CMIP3/5 models also show substantial seasonal variation. For example, soil moisture changes in the North American midlatitudes, coupled with projected warming, increases the strength of land-atmosphere coupling during spring and summer in 15 GCMs under RCP8.5 . For the Cline River watershed in western Canada, Kienzle et al.  find decreases in summer soil moisture content, but annual increases averaging 2.6% by the 2080s using a suite of CMIP3 GCMs simulating B1, A1B and A2 scenarios to drive a regional hydrology model. Hansen et al. , using dynamical downscaling of one GCM running the A2 scenario, find summer soil moisture decreases in Mongolia of up to 6% due to increased potential evaporation in a warming climate and decreased precipitation and decreased precipitation. Soil moisture projections in high latitude permafrost regions are critically important for assessing future climate feedbacks from tracegas emissions  and vegetation changes . In addition to changes in precipitation, snow cover and evapotranspiration, future changes in high-latitude soil moisture also will depend on permafrost degradation, thermokarst evolution, rapid changes in drainage , and changes in plant communities and their water demands. Current understanding of these interacting processes at scales relevant to climate is poor, so that full incorporation in current GCMs is lacking.	0
12.4.5.4 Runoff and Evaporation In the AR4, 21st century model-projected runoff consistently showed decreases in southern Europe, the Middle East, and southwestern USA and increases in Southeast Asia, tropical East Africa and at high northern latitudes. The same general features appear in the CMIP5 ensemble of GCMs for all four RCPs shown in Figure 12.24, with the areas of most robust change typically increasing with magnitude of forcing change. However, the robustness of runoff decreases in the southwestern USA is less in the CMIP5 models compared to the AR4. The large decreases in runoff in southern Europe and southern Africa are consistent with changes in the Hadley Circulation and related precipitation decreases and warming-induced evapotranspiration increases. The high northern latitude runoff increases are likely under RCP8.5 and consistent with the projected precipitation increases . The consistency of changes across different generations of models and different forcing scenarios, together with the physical consistency of change indicates that decreases are also likely in runoff in southern Europe, the Middle East, and southern Africa in this scenario. A number of reports since the AR4 have updated findings from CMIP3 models and analyzed a large set of mechanisms affecting runoff. Several studies have focussed on the Colorado River basin in the United States  showing that runoff reductions that do happen under global warming occur through a	0
c ombination of evapotranspiration increases and precipitation decreases, with the overall reduction in river flow exacerbated by human water demands on the basin's supply. A number of CMIP3 analyses have examined trends and seasonal shifts in runoff. For example, Kienzle et al.  studied climate change scenarios over the Cline River watershed in western Canada and projected  spring runoff and peak streamflow up to 4 weeks earlier than in 1961-1990;  significantly higher streamflow between October and June; and  lower streamflow between July and September. For the Mediterranean basin, an ensemble of regional climate models driven by several GCMs using the A1B scenario have a robust decrease in runoff emerging only after 2050 . Annual mean surface evaporation in the models assessed in AR4 showed increases over most of the ocean and increases or decreases over land with largely the same pattern over land as increases and decreases in precipitation. Similar behaviour occurs in an ensemble of CMIP5 models . Evaporation increases over most of the ocean and land, with prominent areas of decrease over land occurring in southern Africa and northwestern Africa along the Mediterranean. The areas of decrease correspond to areas with reduced precipitation. There is some uncertainty about storm-track changes over Europe . However, the consistency of the decreases across different generations of models and different forcing scenarios along with the physical basis for the precipitation decrease	0
individual storms and fewer weak storms is projected . At seasonal or longer time scales, increased evapotranspiration over land can lead to more frequent and more intense periods of agricultural drought. A general relationship between changes in total precipitation and extreme precipitation does not exist . Two possible mechanisms controlling short-term extreme precipitation amounts are discussed at length in the literature and are similar to the thermodynamic and dynamical mechanisms detailed above for changes in average precipitation. The first considers that extreme precipitation events occur when most of the available atmospheric water vapour rapidly precipitates out in a single storm. The maximum amount of water vapour in air  is determined by the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. As air temperature increases, this saturated amount of water also increases . Kunkel et al.  examined the CMIP5 model RCP4.5 and 8.5 projections for changes in maximum water vapour concentrations, a principal factor controlling the probable bound on maximum precipitation, concluding that maximum water vapour changes are comparable to mean water vapour changes but that the potential for changes in dynamical factors is less compelling. Such increases in atmospheric water vapour are expected to increase the intensity of individual precipitation events, but have less impact on their frequency. As a result	0
A second mechanism for extreme precipitation put forth by O'Gorman and Schneider  is that such events are controlled by anomalous horizontal moisture flux convergence and associated convective updrafts which would change in a more complicated fashion in a warmer world . Emori and Brown  showed that the thermodynamic mechanism dominated over the dynamical mechanism nearly everywhere outside the tropical warm pool. However, Utsumi et al.  used gridded observed daily data to find that daily extreme precipitation monotonically increases with temperature only at high latitudes, with the opposite behaviour in the tropics and a mix in the mid-latitudes. Li et al.  found that both mechanisms contribute to extreme precipitation in a high-resolution aquaplanet model with updrafts as the controlling element in the tropics and air temperature controlling the mid-latitudes consistent with the results by Chou et al. . Using a high-resolution regional model, Berg et al.  found a seasonal dependence in Europe with the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship providing an upper limit to daily precipitation intensity in winter but water availability rather than storage capacity is the controlling factor in summer. Additionally, Lenderink and Van Meijgaard  found that very short  extreme precipitation events increase at a rate twice the amount predicted by Clausius-Clapeyron scaling in a very high-resolution model over Europe suggesting that both mechanisms can interact jointly. Gastineau and Soden  found in the CMIP3 models that the updrafts associated with the most extreme tropical precipitation events actually weaken despite an increase in the frequency of the heaviest rain rates further complicating simple mechanistic explanations. See also Sections 7.6.5 and 11.3.2.5.2. Projections of changes in future extreme precipitation may be larger at the regional scales than for future mean precipitation, but natural variability is also larger causing a tendency for signal-to-noise ratios to decrease when considering increasingly extreme metrics. However, mechanisms of natural variability still are a large factor in assessing the robustness of projections . In addition, largescale circulation changes, which are uncertain, could dominate over the above mechanisms depending on the rarity and type of events considered. However, analysis of CMIP3 models suggests circulation changes are potentially insufficient to offset the influence of increasing atmospheric water vapour on extreme precipitation change over Europe at least on large spatial scales . An additional shift of the storm track has been shown in models with a better representation of the stratosphere, and this is found to lead to an enhanced increase in extreme rainfall over Europe in winter . Similar to temperature extremes , the definition of a precipitation extreme depends very much on context and is often used in discussion of particular climate-related impacts , Box 3.1). Consistently, climate models project future episodes of more intense precipitation in the wet seasons for most of the land areas, especially in the NH and its higher latitudes, and the monsoon regions of the world, and at a global average scale. The actual magnitude of the projected change is dependent on the model used,	0

FAQ 12.2 | How Will the Earth's Water Cycle Change? The flow and storage of water in the Earth's climate system are highly variable, but changes beyond those due to natural variability are expected by the end of the current century. In a warmer world, there will be net increases in rainfall, surface evaporation and plant transpiration. However, there will be substantial differences in the changes between locations. Some places will experience more precipitation and an accumulation of water on land. In others, the amount of water will decrease, due to regional drying and loss of snow and ice cover. The water cycle consists of water stored on the Earth in all its phases, along with the movement of water through the Earth's climate system. In the atmosphere, water occurs primarily as a gas--water vapour--but it also occurs as ice and liquid water in clouds. The ocean, of course, is primarily liquid water, but the ocean is also partly covered by ice in polar regions. Terrestrial water in liquid form appears as surface water--such as lakes and rivers--soil moisture and groundwater. Solid terrestrial water occurs in ice sheets, glaciers, snow and ice on the surface and in permafrost and seasonally frozen soil. Statements about future climate sometimes say that the water cycle will accelerate, but this can be misleading, for strictly speaking, it implies that the cycling of water will occur more and more quickly with time and at all locations. Parts of the world will indeed experience intensification of the water cycle, with larger transports of water and more rapid movement of water into and out of storage reservoirs. However, other parts of the climate system will experience substantial depletion of water, and thus less movement of water. Some stores of water may even vanish. As the Earth warms, some general features of change will occur simply in response to a warmer climate. Those changes are governed by the amount of energy that global warming adds to the climate system. Ice in all forms will melt more rapidly, and be less pervasive. For example, for some simulations assessed in this report, summer Arctic sea ice disappears before the middle of this century. The atmosphere will have more water vapour, and observations and model results indicate that it already does. By the end of the 21st century, the average amount of water vapour in the atmosphere could increase by 5 to 25%, depending on the amount of human emissions of greenhouse gases and radiatively active particles, such as smoke. Water will evaporate more quickly from the surface. Sea level will rise due to expansion of warming ocean waters and melting land ice flowing into the ocean . These general changes are modified by the complexity of the climate system, so that they should not be expected to occur equally in all locations or at the same pace. For example, circulation of water in the atmosphere, on land and in the ocean can change as climate changes, concentrating water in some locations and depleting it in others. The changes also may vary throughout the year: some seasons tend to be wetter than others. Thus, model simulations assessed in this report show that winter precipitation in northern Asia may increase by more than 50%, whereas summer precipitation there is projected to hardly change. Humans also intervene directly in the water cycle, through water management and changes in land use. Changing population distributions and water practices would produce further changes in the water cycle.	0
Water cycle processes can occur over minutes, hours, days and longer, and over distances from metres to kilometres and greater. Variability on these scales is typically greater than for temperature, so climate changes in precipitation are harder to discern. Despite this complexity, projections of future climate show changes that are common across many models and climate forcing scenarios. Similar changes were reported in the AR4. These results collectively suggest well understood mechanisms of change, even if magnitudes vary with model and forcing. We focus here on changes over land, where changes in the water cycle have their largest impact on human and natural systems. Projected climate changes from simulations assessed in this report  generally show an increase in precipitation in parts of the deep tropics and polar latitudes that could exceed 50% by the end of the 21st century under the most extreme emissions scenario. In contrast, large areas of the subtropics could have decreases of 30% or more. In the tropics, these changes appear to be governed by increases in atmospheric water vapour and changes in atmospheric circulation that further concentrate water vapour in the tropics and thus promote more tropical rainfall. In the subtropics, these circulation changes simultaneously promote less rainfall despite warming in these regions. Because the subtropics are home to most of the world's deserts, these changes imply increasing aridity in already dry areas, and possible expansion of deserts. 	0
Increases at higher latitudes are governed by warmer temperatures, which allow more water in the atmosphere and thus, more water that can precipitate. The warmer climate also allows storm systems in the extratropics to transport more water vapour into the higher latitudes, without requiring substantial changes in typical wind strength. As indicated above, high latitude changes are more pronounced during the colder seasons. Whether land becomes drier or wetter depends partly on precipitation changes, but also on changes in surface evaporation and transpiration from plants . Because a warmer atmosphere can have more water vapour, it can induce greater evapotranspiration, given sufficient terrestrial water. However, increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reduces a plant's tendency to transpire into the atmosphere, partly counteracting the effect of warming. In the tropics, increased evapotranspiration tends to counteract the effects of increased precipitation on soil moisture, whereas in the subtropics, already low amounts of soil moisture allow for little change in evapotranspiration. At higher latitudes, the increased precipitation generally outweighs increased evapotranspiration in projected climates, yielding increased annual mean runoff, but mixed changes in soil moisture. As implied by circulation changes in FAQ 12.2, Figure 1, boundaries of high or low moisture regions may also shift. A further complicating factor is the character of rainfall. Model projections show rainfall becoming more intense, in part because more moisture will be present in the atmosphere. Thus, for simulations assessed in this report, over much of the land, 1-day precipitation events that currently occur on average every 20 years could occur every 10 years or even more frequently by the end of the 21st century. At the same time, projections also show that precipitation events overall will tend to occur less frequently. These changes produce two seemingly contradictory effects: more intense downpours, leading to more floods, yet longer dry periods between rain events, leading to more drought. Wetter At high latitudes and at high elevation, further changes occur due to the loss of frozen water. Some of these are resolved by the present generation of global climate models , and some changes can only be inferred because they involve features such as glaciers, which typically are not resolved or included in the models. The warmer climate means that snow tends to start accumulating later in the fall, and melt earlier in the spring. Simulations assessed in this report show March to April snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere is projected to decrease by approximately 10 to 30% on average by the end of this century, depending on the greenhouse gas scenario. The earlier spring melt alters the timing of peak springtime flow in rivers receiving snowmelt. As a result, later flow rates will decrease, potentially affecting water resource management. These features appear in GCM simulations.	0
FAQ 12.2, Figure 1 | Schematic diagram of projected changes in major components of the water cycle. The blue arrows indicate major types of water movement changes through the Earth's climate system: poleward water transport by extratropical winds, evaporation from the surface and runoff from the land to the oceans. The shaded regions denote areas more likely to become drier or wetter. Yellow arrows indicate an important atmospheric circulation change by the Hadley Circulation, whose upward motion promotes tropical rainfall, while suppressing subtropical rainfall. Model projections indicate that the Hadley Circulation will shift its downward branch poleward in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with associated drying. Wetter conditions are projected at high latitudes, because a warmer atmosphere will allow greater precipitation, with greater movement of water into these regions.	0
Loss of permafrost will allow moisture to seep more deeply into the ground, but it will also allow the ground to warm, which could enhance evapotranspiration. However, most current GCMs do not include all the processes needed to simulate well permafrost changes. Studies analysing soils freezing or using GCM output to drive more detailed land models suggest substantial permafrost loss by the end of this century. In addition, even though current GCMs do not explicitly include glacier evolution, we can expect that glaciers will continue to recede, and the volume of water they provide to rivers in the summer may dwindle in some locations as they disappear. Loss of glaciers will also contribute to a reduction in springtime river flow. However, if annual mean precipitation increases--either as snow or rain--then these results do not necessarily mean that annual mean river flow will decrease.	0
but there is strong agreement across the models over the direction of change . Regional details are less robust in terms of the relative magnitude of changes but remain in good accord across models in terms of the sign of the change and the large-scale geographical patterns . In semi-arid regions of the midlatitudes and subtropics such as the Mediterranean, the southwest USA, southwestern Australia, southern Africa and a large portion of South America, the tendency manifested in the majority of model simulations is for longer dry periods and is consistent with the average decreases shown in Figure 12.22. Figure 12.26 shows projected percent changes in RX5day, the annual maximum of consecutive 5-day precipitation over land regions obtained from the CMIP5 models . Globally averaged end of 21st century changes over land range from 5%  to 20%  more precipitation during very wet 5-day periods. Results from the CMIP3 models are shown for comparison . Locally, the few regions where this index of extreme precipitation decreases in the late 21st century RCP8.5 projection coincide with areas of robust decreases in the mean precipitation of Figure 12.22. Drought is discussed extensively in the SREX report  and the conclusions about future drought risk described there based on CMIP3 models are reinforced by the CMIP5 models. As noted in the SREX reports, assessments of changes in drought characteristics with climate change should be made in the context of specific impacts questions. The risk of future agricultural drought episodes is increased in the regions of robust soil moisture decrease described in Section 12.4.5.3 and shown in Figure 12.23. Other measures in the literature of future agricultural drought are largely focussed on the Palmer Drought Severity Index  and project `extreme' drought as the normal climatological state by the end of the 21st century under the high emission scenarios in many mid-latitude locations. However, this measure of agricultural drought has been criticized as overly sensitive to increased temperatures due to	0
a simplified soil moisture model . The consecutive dry-day index  is the length of the longest period of consecutive days with precipitation less than 1 mm . CMIP5 projected changes in CDD over the 2081-2100 period under the RCP8.5 scenario  from the CMIP5 models are shown in Figure 12.26c and exhibit patterns similar to projected changes in both precipitation and soil moisture . Substantial increases in this measure of meteorological drought are projected in the Mediterranean, Central America, Brazil, South Africa and Australia while decreases are projected in high northern latitudes. Truly rare precipitation events can cause very significant impacts. The statistics of these events at the tails of the precipitation distribution are well described by Extreme Value  Theory although there are significant biases in the direct comparison of gridded model output and actual station data . There is also strong evidence that model resolution plays a key role in replicating EV quantities estimated from gridded observational data, suggesting that high-resolution models may provide somewhat more confidence in projection of changes in rare precipitation events . Figure 12.27 shows the late 21st century changes per degree Celsius in local warming in 20-year return values of annual maximum daily precipitation relative to the late 20th century  and the associated return periods of late 20th century 20-year return values at the end of the 21st century from the CMIP5 models. Across future emission scenarios, the global average of the CMIP5 multi-model median return value sensitivity is an increase of 5.3% C-1 . The CMIP5 land average is close to the CMIP3 value of 4% C-1 reported by Min et al.  for a subset of CMIP3 models. Corresponding with this change, the global average of return periods of late 20th century 20-year return values is reduced from 20 years to 14 years for a 1C local warming. Return periods are projected to be reduced by about 10 to 20% C-1 over the most of the mid-latitude land masses with larger reductions over wet tropical regions . Hence, extreme precipitation events will very likely be more intense	0
and more frequent in these regions in a warmer climate. Reductions in return values  are confined to convergent oceanic regions where circulation changes have reduced the available water vapour. Severe thunderstorms, associated with large hail, high winds, and tornadoes, are another example of extreme weather associated with the water cycle. The large-scale environments in which they occur are characterized by large Convective Available Potential Energy  and deep tropospheric wind shear . Del Genio et al. , Trapp et al. , and Van Klooster and Roebber  found a general increase in the energy and decrease in the shear terms from the late 20th century to the late 21st century over the USA using a variety of regional model simulations embedded in global model SRES scenario simulations. The relative change between these two competing factors would tend to favour more environments that would support severe thunderstorms, providing storms are initiated. Trapp et al. , for example, found an increase in favourable thunderstorm conditions for all regions of the USA east of the Rocky Mountains. Large variability in both the energy and shear terms means that statistical significance is not reached until late in the 21st century under high forcing scenarios. One way of assessing the possibility of a change in the frequency of future thunderstorms is to look at historical records of observed tornado, hail and wind occurrence with respect to the environmental conditions . This indicates that an increase in the fraction of severe thunderstorms containing non-tornadic winds would be consistent with the model projections of increased energy and decreased shear, but there has not been enough research to make a firm conclusion regarding future changes in frequency or magnitude. Less work has been done on projected changes outside of the USA. Marsh et al.  found that mean energy decreased in the warm season in Europe while it increased in the cool season. Even though the energy decreases in the warm season, the number of days with favourable environments for severe thunderstorms increases because of an increasing number of days with relatively large values of available energy. For Europe, with the Mediterranean Sea and Sahara Desert to the south, questions remain about changes in boundary layer moisture, a main driver of the energy term. Niall and Walsh  examined changes in CAPE, which may be associated with hailstorm occurrence in southeastern Australia using a global model, and found little change under warmer conditions. Leslie et al.  reconsidered the southeastern Australia hail question by nesting models with 1 km horizontal grid spacing and using sophisticated microphysical parameterizations and found an increase in the frequency of large hail by 2050 under the SRES A1B scenario, but with extremely large internal variability in the environments and hail size. Overall, for all parts of the world studied, the results are suggestive of a trend toward environments favouring more severe thunderstorms, but the small number of analyses precludes any likelihood estimate of this change.	0
12.4.6.1 Changes in Sea Ice Cover Based on the analysis of CMIP3 climate change simulations , the AR4 concludes that the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice covers are projected to shrink in the 21st century under all SRES scenarios, with a large range of model responses . It also stresses that, in some projections, the Arctic Ocean becomes almost entirely ice-free in late summer during the second half of the 21st century. These conclusions were confirmed by further analyses of the CMIP3 archives . Figures 12.28 and 12.29 and the studies of Maksym et al. , Massonnet et al. , Stroeve et al.  and Wang and Overland  show that the CMIP5 AOGCMs/ESMs as a group also project decreases in sea ice extent through the end of this century in both hemispheres under all RCPs. However, as in the case of CMIP3, the inter-model spread is considerable. In the NH, in accordance with CMIP3 results, the absolute rate of decrease of the CMIP5 multi-model mean sea ice areal coverage is greatest in September. The reduction in sea ice extent between the time periods 1986-2005 and 2081-2100 for the CMIP5 multi-model average ranges from 8% for RCP2.6 to 34% for RCP8.5 in February and from 43% for RCP2.6 to 94% for RCP8.5 in September. Medium confidence is attached to these values as projections of sea ice extent decline in the real world due to errors in the simulation of present-day sea ice extent  and because of the large spread of model responses. About 90% of the available CMIP5 models reach nearly ice-free conditions  during September in the Arctic before 2100 under RCP8.5 . By the end of the 21st century, the decrease in multi-model mean sea ice volume ranges from 29% for RCP2.6 to 73% for RCP8.5 in February and from 54% for RCP2.6 to 96% for RCP8.5 in September. Medium confidence is attached to these values as projections of the real world sea ice volume. In February, these percentages are much higher than the corresponding ones for sea ice extent, which is indicative of a substantial sea ice thinning. A frequent criticism of the CMIP3 models is that, as a group, they strongly underestimate the rapid decline in summer Arctic sea ice extent observed during the past few decades , which suggests that the CMIP3 projections of summer Arctic sea ice areal coverage might be too conservative. As shown in Section 9.4.3 and Figure 12.28b, the magnitude of the CMIP5 multi-model mean trend in September Arctic sea ice extent over the satellite era is more consistent with, but still underestimates, the observed one . Owing to the shortness of the observational record, it is difficult to ascertain the relative influence of natural variability on this trend. This hinders the comparison between modelled and observed trends, and hence the estimate of the sensitivity of the September Arctic sea ice extent to global surface temperature change (i.e., the decrease in sea ice extent per degree global 1087	0
warming) . This sensitivity may be crucial for determining future sea ice losses. Indeed, a clear relationship exists at longer than decadal time scales in climate change simulations between the annual mean or September mean Arctic sea ice extent and the annual mean global surface temperature change for ice extents larger than ~1 x 106 km2 . This relationship is illustrated in Figure 12.30 for both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models. From this figure, it can be seen that the sea ice sensitivity varies significantly from model to model and is generally larger and in better agreement among models in CMIP5. A complete and detailed explanation for what controls the range of Arctic sea ice responses in models over the 21st century remains elusive, but the Arctic sea ice provides an example where process-based constraints can be used to reduce the spread of model projections	0
. For CMIP3 models, results indicate that the changes in Arctic sea ice mass budget over the 21st century are related to the late 20th century mean sea ice thickness distribution , average sea ice thickness , fraction of thin ice cover  and oceanic heat transport to the Arctic . For CMIP5 models, Massonnet et al.  showed that the time needed for the September Arctic sea ice areal coverage to drop below a certain threshold is highly correlated with the September sea ice extent and annual mean sea ice volume averaged over the past several decades . The timing of a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean or the fraction of remaining sea ice in September at any time during the 21st century were also found to correlate with the past trend in September Arctic sea ice extent and the amplitude of the mean seasonal cycle of sea ice extent  . All these empirical	0

the basis of their simulated late 20th century mean September Arctic sea ice extent. Wang and Overland  selected a subset of CMIP3 models  did the same for the CMIP5 models) based on their fidelity to the observed mean seasonal cycle of Arctic sea ice extent in the late 20th century and then scaled the chosen models to the recently observed September sea ice extent. Zhang  retained a number of CMIP3 models based on the regression between summer sea ice loss and Arctic surface temperature change. Boe et al.  and Mahlstein and Knutti  did not perform a model selection but rather recalibrated the CMIP3 Arctic sea ice projections on available observations of September Arctic sea ice trend and sensitivity to global surface temperature change, respectively. Finally, Massonnet et al.  selected a subset of CMIP5 models on the basis of the four relationships illustrated in Figure 12.31a-d. These various methods all suggest a faster rate of summer Arctic sea ice decline than the multi-model mean. Although they individually provide a reduced range for the year of near disappearance of the September Arctic sea ice compared to the original CMIP3/CMIP5 multi-model ensemble, they lead to different timings . Consequently, the time interval obtained when combining all these studies remains wide: 2020-2100+  for the SRES A1B scenario and RCP4.5  and 2020-2060 for RCP8.5 . The method proposed by Massonnet et al.  is applied here to the full set of models that provided the CMIP5 database with sea ice output. The natural variability of each of the four diagnostics shown in Figure 12.31a-d is first estimated by averaging over all available models with more than one ensemble member the diagnostic standard deviations derived from the model 1090	0
ensemble members. Then, for each model, a 2 standard deviation interval is constructed around the ensemble mean or single realization of the diagnostic considered. A model is retained if, for each diagnostic, either this interval overlaps a 20% interval around the observed/reanalysed value of the diagnostic or at least one ensemble member from that model gives a value for the diagnostic that falls within 20% of the observational/reanalysed data. The outcome is displayed in Figure 12.31e for RCP8.5. Among the five selected models , four project a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in September before 2050  for RCP8.5 , the earliest and latest years of near disappearance of the sea ice pack being about 2040 and about 2060 , respectively. It should be mentioned that Maslowski et al.  projected that it would take only until about 2016 to reach a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in summer, based on a linear extrapolation into the future of the recent sea ice volume trend from a hindcast simulation conducted with a regional model of the Arctic sea ice-ocean system. However, such an extrapolation approach is problematic as it ignores the negative feedbacks that can occur when the sea ice cover becomes thin  and neglects the effect of year-to-year or longer-term variability . Mahlstein and Knutti  encompassed the dependence of sea ice projections on the forcing scenario by determining the annual mean global surface warming threshold for nearly ice-free conditions in September. Their best estimate of ~2C above the present derived from both CMIP3 models and observations is consistent with the 1.6 to 2.1C range  obtained from the CMIP5 model subset shown in Figure 12.31e . The reduction in September Arctic sea ice extent by the end of the 21st century, averaged over this subset of models, ranges from 56% for RCP2.6 to 100% for RCP8.5.	0

In light of all these results, it is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin all year round during the 21st century as the annual mean global surface temperature rises. It is also likely that the Arctic Ocean will become nearly ice-free in September before the middle of the century for high GHG emissions such as those corresponding to RCP8.5 . The potential irreversibility of the Arctic sea ice loss and the possibility of an abrupt transition toward an ice-free Arctic Ocean are discussed in Section 12.5.5.7. In the SH, the decrease in sea ice extent between 1986-2005 and 2081-2100 projected by the CMIP5 models as a group varies from 16% for RCP2.6 to 67% for RCP8.5 in February and from 8% to 30% in September. In contrast with the NH, the absolute rate of decline is greatest in wintertime. Eisenman et al.  argue that this hemispheric asymmetry in the seasonality of sea ice loss is fundamentally related to the geometry of coastlines. For each forcing scenario, the relative changes in multi-model mean February and September Antarctic sea ice volumes by the end of the century are of the same order as the corresponding ones for sea ice extent. About 75% of the available CMIP5 models reach a nearly ice-free state in February within this century under RCP8.5 . For RCP8.5, only small portions of the Weddell and Ross Seas stay ice-covered in February during 2081-2100 in those models that do not project a seasonally ice-free Southern Ocean . Nonetheless, there is low confidence in these Antarctic sea ice projections because of the wide range of model responses and the inability of almost all of the models to reproduce the mean seasonal cycle, interannual variability and overall increase of the Antarctic sea ice areal coverage observed during the satellite era .	0
Excluding ice sheets and glaciers, analyses of seasonal snow cover changes generally focus on the NH, where the configuration of the continents on the Earth induces a larger maximum seasonal snow cover extent  and a larger sensitivity of SCE to climate changes. Seasonal snow cover extent and snow water equivalent  respond to both temperature and precipitation. At the beginning and the end of the snow season, SCE decreases are closely linked to a shortening of the seasonal snow cover duration, while SWE is more sensitive to snowfall amount . Future widespread reductions of SCE, particularly in spring, are simulated by the CMIP3 models  and confirmed by the CMIP5 ensemble . The NH spring  snow cover area changes are coherent in the CMIP5 models although there is considerable scatter. Relative to the 1986-2005 reference period, the CMIP5 models simulate a weak decrease of about 7  4%  for RCP2.6 during the last two decades of the 21st century, while SCE decreases of about 13  4% are simulated for RCP4.5, 15  5% for RCP6.0, and 25  8% for RCP8.5 . There is medium confidence in these numbers because of the considerable inter-model scatter mentioned above and because snow processes in global climate models are strongly simplified.	0

regions, while annual maximum SWE decreases are strong closer to the southern limit of the seasonally snow-covered area. It is thus very likely  that by the end of the 21st century, NH spring snow cover extent will be substantially lower than today if anthropogenic climate forcing is similar to the stronger scenarios considered here. Conversely, there is only medium confidence in the latitudinal pattern of annual maximum SWE changes  because annual maximum SWE is influenced by competing factors . The strong projected warming across the northern high latitudes in climate model simulations has implications for frozen ground. Recent projections of the extent of near-surface permafrost  degradation continue to vary widely depending on the underlying climate forcing scenario and model physics, but virtually all of them indicate substantial near-surface permafrost degradation and thaw depth deepening over much of the permafrost area . Permafrost at greater depths is less directly relevant to the surface energy and water balance, and its degradation naturally occurs much more slowly . Climate models are beginning to represent permafrost physical processes and properties more accurately , but there are large disagreements in the calculation of current frozen soil extent and active layer depth due to differences in the land model physics in the CMIP5 ensemble . The projected changes in permafrost are a response not only to warming, but also to changes in snow conditions because snow properties and their seasonal evolution exert significant control on soil thermal state . Applying the surface frost index method  to coupled climate model anomalies from the CMIP5 models  yields a reduction of the diagnosed 2080-2099 near-surface permafrost area  by 37  11% , 51  13% , 58  13% , and 8112% , compared to the 1986-2005 diagnosed near-surface permafrost area, with medium confidence in the numbers as such because of the strongly simplified soil physical processes in current-generation global climate models . The uncertainty range given here is the 1- inter-model dispersion. Applying directly the model output to diagnose permafrost extent and its changes over the 21st century yields similar relative changes . In summary, based on high agreement across CMIP5 and older model projections, fundamental process understanding, and paleoclimatic evidence , it appears virtually certain  that near-surface permafrost extent will shrink as global climate warms. However, the amplitude of the projected reductions of near-surface permafrost extent not only depends on the emission scenario and the global climate model response, but also very much on the permafrost-related soil processes taken into account in the models.	0
12.4.7.1 Sea Surface Temperature, Salinity and Ocean Heat Content Projected increase of SST and heat content over the next two decades is relatively insensitive to the emissions trajectory. However, projected outcomes diverge as the 21st century progresses. When SSTs increase as a result of external forcing, the interior water masses respond to the integrated signal at the surface, which is then propagated down to greater depth . Changes in globally averaged ocean heat content currently account for about 90% of the change in global energy inventory since 1970 . Heat is transported within the interior of the ocean by its large-scale general circulation and by smaller-scale mixing processes. Changes in transports lead to redistribution of existing heat content and can cause local cooling even though the global mean heat content is rising . Figure 12.12 shows the multi-model mean projections of zonally averaged ocean temperature change under three emission scenarios. The differences in projected ocean temperature changes for different RCPs manifest themselves more markedly as the century progresses. The largest warming is found in the top few hundred metres of the subtropical gyres, similar to the observed pattern of ocean temperature changes . Surface warming varies considerably between the emission scenarios ranging from about 1C  to more than 3C in RCP8.5. Mixing and advection processes gradually transfer the additional heat to deeper levels of about 2000 m at the end of the 21st century. Depending on the emission scenario, global ocean warming between 0.5C  and 1.5C  will reach a depth of about 1 km by the end of the century. The strongest warming signal is found at the surface in subtropical and tropical regions. At depth the warming is most pronounced in the Southern Ocean. From an energy point of view, for RCP4.5 by the end of the 21st century, half of the energy taken up by the ocean is in the uppermost 700 m, and 85% is in the uppermost 2000 m. In addition to the upper-level warming, the patterns are further characterized by a slight cooling in parts of the northern mid- and high latitudes below 1000 m and a pronounced heat uptake in the deep Southern Ocean at the end of the 21st century. The cooling may be linked to the projected decrease of the strength of the AMOC . The response of ocean temperatures to external forcing comprises mainly two time scales: a relatively fast adjustment of the ocean mixed layer and the slow response of the deep ocean . Simulations with coupled ocean- atmosphere GCMs suggest time-scales of several millennia until the deep ocean is in equilibrium with the external forcing . Thus, the long time-scale of the ocean response to external forcing implies an additional commitment to warming for many centuries when GHG emissions are decreased or concentrations kept constant . Further assessment of ocean heat uptake and its relationship to projections of sea level rise is presented in Section 13.4.1. 1093	0
Almost all climate model projections reveal an increase of high latitude temperature and high latitude precipitation . Both of these effects tend to make the high latitude surface waters lighter and hence increase their stability. As seen in Figure 12.35, all models show a weakening of the AMOC over the course of the 21st century . Projected changes in the strength of the AMOC at high latitudes appear stronger in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory  CM2.1 when density is used as a vertical coordinate instead of depth . Once the RF is stabilized, the AMOC recovers, but in some models to less than its pre-industrial level. The recovery may include a significant overshoot  if the anthropogenic RF is eliminated . Gregory et al.  found that for all eleven models	0
analysed , the AMOC reduction was caused more by changes in surface heat flux than changes in surface freshwater flux. They further found that models with a stronger AMOC in their control run exhibited a larger weakening . Based on the assessment of the CMIP5 RCP simulations and on our understanding gleaned from analysis of CMIP3 models, observations and our understanding of physical mechanisms, it is very likely that the AMOC will weaken over the 21st century. Best estimates and ranges for the reduction from CMIP5 are 11%  in RCP2.6 and 34%  in RCP8.5. There is low confidence in assessing the evolution of the AMOC beyond the 21st century.	0
12.4.7.3 Southern Ocean A dominant and robust feature of the CMIP3 climate projections assessed in AR4 is the weaker surface warming at the end of the 21st century in the Southern Ocean area compared to the global mean. Furthermore, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current  moves southward in most of the climate projections analysed in response to the simulated southward shift and strengthening of the SH mid-latitude westerlies . The additional analyses of the CMIP3 model output performed since the release of AR4 confirm and refine the earlier findings. The displacement and intensification of the mid-latitude westerlies contribute to a large warming between 40S and 60S from the surface to mid-depths . Part of this warming has been attributed to the southward translation of the Southern Ocean current system . Moreover, the wind changes influence the surface temperature through modifications of the latent and sensible heat fluxes and force a larger northward Ekman transport of relatively cold polar surface water . This also leads to a stronger upwelling that brings southward and upward relatively warm and salty deep water, resulting in a subsurface salinity increase at mid-depths south of 50S . Overall, CMIP3 climate projections exhibit a decrease in mixed layer depth at southern mid- and high latitudes by the end of the 21st century. This feature is a consequence of the enhanced stratification resulting from surface warming and freshening . Despite large inter-model differences, there is a robust weakening of Antarctic Bottom Water production and its northward outflow, which is consistent with the decrease in surface density and is manifest as a warming signal close to the Antarctic margin that reaches abyssal depths . In the vicinity of the Antarctic ice sheet, CMIP3 models project an average warming of ~0.5C at depths of 200-500 m in 2091-2100 compared to 1991-2000 for the SRES A1B scenario, which has the potential to impact the mass balance of ice shelves . More detailed regional modelling using the SRES A1B scenario indicates that a redirection of the coastal current into the cavities underlying the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf during the second half of the 21st century	0
might enhance the average basal melting rate there from 0.2 m yr-1 to almost 4 m yr-1 . There are very few published analyses of CMIP5 climate projections focusing on the Southern Ocean. Meijers et al.  found a wide variety of ACC responses to climate warming scenarios across CMIP5 models. Models show a high correlation between the changes in ACC strength and position, with a southward  shift of the ACC core as the ACC gets stronger . No clear relationship between future changes in wind stress and ACC strength was identified, while the weakening of the ACC transport simulated at the end of the 21st century by many models was found to correlate with the strong decrease in the surface heat and freshwater fluxes in the ACC region . In agreement with the CMIP3 assessment , subtropical gyres generally strengthen under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and all expand southward, inducing a southward shift of the northern boundary of the ACC at most longitudes in the majority of CMIP5 models . As in CMIP3 climate projections, an overall shallowing of the deep mixed layers that develop on the northern edge of the ACC in winter is observed, with larger shallowing simulated by models with deeper mixed layers during 1976-2005 . Sallee et al.  reported a warming of all mode, intermediate and deep water masses in the Southern Ocean. The largest temperature increase is found in mode and intermediate water layers. Consistently with CMIP3 projections , these water layers experience a freshening, whereas bottom water becomes slightly saltier. Finally, Sallee et al.  noted an enhanced upwelling of circumpolar deep water and an increased subduction of intermediate water that are nearly balanced by interior processes . A number of studies suggest that oceanic mesoscale eddies might influence the response of the Southern Ocean circulation, meridional heat transport and deep water formation to changes in wind stress and surface buoyancy flux . These eddies are not explicitly resolved in climate models and their role in future circulation changes still needs to be precisely quantified. Some of the CMIP5 models have output the meridional overturning due to the Eulerian mean circulation and that induced by parameterized eddies, thus providing a quantitative estimate of the role of the mesoscale circulation in a warming climate. On this basis, Downes and Hogg  found that, under RCP8.5, the strengthening  of the upper  Eulerian mean meridional overturning cell in the Southern Ocean is significantly correlated with the increased overlying wind stress and surface warming and is partly compensated at best by changes in eddy-induced overturning. None of the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models include an interactive ice sheet component. When climate-ice sheet interactions are accounted for in an EMIC under a 4 x CO2 scenario, the meltwater flux from the Antarctic ice sheet further reduces the surface density close to Antarctica and the rate of Antarctic Bottom Water formation. This ultimately results in a smaller surface warming at high southern latitudes compared to a simulation in which the freshwater flux from the melting ice sheet is not taken into account . Nevertheless, in this study, this effect becomes significant only after more than one century. 1095	0
12.4.8 Changes Associated with Carbon Cycle Feedbacks and Vegetation Cover Climate change may affect the global biogeochemical cycles changing the magnitude of the natural sources and sinks of major GHGs. Numerous studies investigated the interactions between climate change and the carbon cycle , methane cycle , ozone  or aerosols . Many CMIP5 ESMs now include a representation of the carbon cycle as well as atmospheric chemistry, allowing interactive projections of GHGs  and aerosols. With such models, projections account for the imposed changes in anthropogenic emissions, but also for changes in natural sources and sinks as they respond to changes in climate and atmospheric composition. If included in ESMs, the impact on projected concentration, RF and hence on climate can be quantified. Climate-induced changes on the carbon cycle are assessed below, while changes in natural emissions of CH4 are assessed in Chapter 6, changes in atmospheric chemistry in Chapter 11, and climate-aerosol interactions are assessed in Chapter 7.	0
uncertainty taken from 19 CMIP3 models and carbon cycle feedbacks uncertainty taken from 10 C4MIP models, generating 190 model simulations . The emulation of the CMIP3/C4MIP models shows for the RCP8.5, a range of simulated CO2 concentrations of 794 to 1149 ppm , extremely similar to what is obtained with the CMIP5 ESMs, with atmospheric concentration as high as 1150 ppm by 2100, that is, more than 200 ppm above the prescribed CO2 concentration. Global warming simulated by the E-driven runs show higher upper ends than when atmospheric CO2 concentration is prescribed. For the models assessed here, the global surface temperature change  ranges between 2.6C and 4.7C, with a multi-model average of 3.7C  0.7C for the concentration driven simulations, while the emission driven simulations give a range of 2.5C to 5.6C, with a multi-model average of 3.9C  0.9C, that is, 5% larger than for the concentration driven runs. The models that simulate the largest CO2 concentration by 2100 have the largest warming amplification in the emission driven simulations, with an additional warming of more than 0.5C.	0
As presented in Section 12.3, the CMIP5 experimental design includes, for the RCP8.5 scenario, experiments driven either by prescribed anthropogenic CO2 emissions or concentration. The historical and 21st century emission-driven simulations allow evaluating the climate response of the Earth system when atmospheric CO2 and the climate response are interactively being calculated by the ESMs. In such ESMs, the atmospheric CO2 is calculated as the difference between the imposed anthropogenic emissions and the sum of land and ocean carbon uptakes. As most of these ESMs account for land use changes and their CO2 emissions, the only external forcing is fossil fuel CO2 emissions . For a given ESM, the emission driven and concentration driven simulations would show different climate projections if the simulated atmospheric CO2 in the emission driven run is significantly different from the one prescribed for the concentration driven runs. This would happen if the ESMs carbon cycle is different from the one simulated by MAGICC6, the model used to calculate the CMIP5 GHGs concentrations from the emissions for the four RCPs . When driven by CO2 concentration, the ESMs can calculate the fossil fuel CO2 emissions that would be compatible with the prescribed atmospheric CO2 trajectory, allowing comparison with the set of CO2 emissions initially estimated by the IAMs  . Figure 12.36 shows the simulated atmospheric CO2 and global average surface air temperature warming  for the RCP8.5 emission driven simulations from the CMIP5 ESMs, compared to the concentration driven simulations from the same models. Most  of the models estimate a larger CO2 concentration than the prescribed one. By 2100, the multimodel average CO2 concentration is 985  97 ppm , while the CO2 concentration prescribed for the RCP8.5 is 936 ppm. Figure 12.36 also shows the range of atmospheric CO2 projections when the MAGICC6 model, used to provide the RCP concentrations, is tuned to emulate combinations of climate sensitivity 1096	0
The uncertainty on the carbon cycle has been shown to be of comparable magnitude to the uncertainty arising from physical climate processes . Huntingford et al.  used a simple model to characterize the relative role of carbon cycle and climate sensitivity uncertainties in contributing to the range of future temperature changes, concluding that the range of carbon cycle processes represent about 40% of the physical feedbacks. Perturbed parameter ensembles systematically explore land carbon cycle parameter uncertainty and illustrate that a wide range of carbon cycle responses are consistent with the same underlying model structures and plausible parameter ranges . Figure 12.37 shows how the comparable range of future climate change  arises from parametric uncertainty in land carbon cycle and atmospheric feedbacks. The same ensemble shows that the range of atmospheric CO2 in the land carbon cycle ensemble is wider than the full SRES concentration range . The CMIP5 ESMs described above do not include the positive feedback arising from the carbon release from high latitudes permafrost thawing under a warming scenario, which could further increase the atmospheric CO2 concentration and the warming. Two recent studies investigated the climate-permafrost feedback from simulations with models of intermediate complexity  that accounts for a permafrost carbon module . Burke et al.  also estimated carbon loss from permafrost, from a diagnostic of the present-day permafrost carbon store and future soil warming as simulated by CMIP5 models. However, this last study did not quantify the effect on global temperature. Each of these studies found that the range of additional warming due to the permafrost carbon loss is quite large, because of uncertainties in future high latitude soil warming, amount of carbon stored in permafrost soils, vulnerability of freshly thawed organic material, the proportion of soil carbon that might be emitted as carbon dioxide via aerobic decomposition or as methane via anaerobic decomposition . For the RCP8.5, the additional warming from permafrost ranges between 0.04C and 0.69C by 2100 although	0

Vegetation cover can also be affected by climate change, with forest cover potentially being decreasing  or increasing . In particular, the Amazon forest has been the subject of several studies, generally agreeing that future climate change would increase the risk tropical Amazon forest being replaced by seasonal forest or even savannah . Increase in atmospheric CO2 would partly reduce such risk, through increase in water efficiency under elevated CO2 . Recent multi-model estimates based on different CMIP3 climate scenarios and different dynamic global vegetation models predict a moderate risk of tropical forest reduction in South America and even lower risk for African and Asian tropical forests  .	0
CMIP5 ESMs also include human induced land cover changes  affecting the climate system through changes in land surface physical properties . Future changes in land cover will have an impact on the climate system through biophysical and biogeochemical processes . Biophysical processes include changes in surface albedo and changes in partitioning between latent and sensible heat, while biogeochemical feedbacks essentially include change in CO2 sources and sinks but could potentially also include changes in N2O or CH4 emissions. The biophysical response to future land cover changes has been investigated within the SRES scenarios. Using the SRES A2 2100 land cover, Davin et al.  simulated a global cooling of 0.14 K relatively to a simulation with present-day land cover, the cooling being largely driven by change in albedo. Regional analyses have been performed in order to quantify the biophysical impact of biofuels plantation generally finding a local to regional cooling when annual crops are replaced by bioenergy crops, such as sugar cane . However, some energy crops require nitrogen inputs for their production, leading inevitably to nitrous oxide  emissions, potentially reducing the direct cooling effect and the benefit of biofuels as an alternative to fossil fuel emissions. Such emission estimates are still uncertain, varying strongly for different crops, management methods, soil types and reference systems . In the context of the Land-Use and Climate, IDentification of robust impacts  project  ESMs performed additional CMIP5 simulations in order to separate the biophysical from the biogeochemical effects of land use changes in the RCP scenarios. The LUCID-CMIP5 experiments were designed to complement RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 simulations of CMIP5, both of which showing an intensification of land use change over the 21st century. The LUCID-CMIP5 analysis was focussed on a difference in climate and land-atmosphere fluxes between the average of ensemble of simulations with and without land use changes by the end of 21st century . Due to different interpretation of land use classes, areas of crops and pastures were specific for each ESM . On the global scale, simulated biophysical effects of land use changes projected in the CMIP5 experiments with prescribed CO2 concentrations were not significant. However, these effects were significant for regions with land use changes >10%. Only three out of six participating models, CanESM2, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC-ESM, reveal statistically significant changes in regional mean annual mean surface air temperature for the RCP8.5 scenario . However, there is low confidence on the overall effect as there is no agreement among the models on the sign of the global average temperature change due to the biophysical effects of land use changes . Changes in land surface albedo, available energy, latent and sensible	0
heat fluxes were relatively small but significant in most of ESMs for regions with substantial land use changes. The scale of climatic effects reflects a small magnitude of land use changes in both the RCP2.6 and 8.5 scenarios and their limitation mainly to the tropical and subtropical regions where differences between biophysical effects of forests and grasslands are less pronounced than in mid- and high latitudes. LUCIDCMIP5 did not perform similar simulations for the RCP4.5 or RCP6.0 scenarios. As these two scenarios show a global decrease of land use area, one might expect their climatic impact to be different from the one seen in the RC2.6 and RCP8.5.	0

The boxes and whiskers indicate the 5th percentile, mean value - 1 standard deviation, mean, mean value + 1 standard deviation and 95th percentile of the distributions. The first box-and-whiskers on the left is computed directly from the CMIP3 ensemble and corresponds to the numbers quoted in AR4. The emulated SRES A1B projections  of CMIP5 are obtained by the method of Good et al.  and are calculated for the period 20802099 expressed with respect to the AR4 baseline period of 1980-1999. Because of the method, the subset of CMIP5 that are emulated are restricted to those with pre-industrial control, abrupt 4 x CO2, historical, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 simulations. The emulated RCP6.0 projections of CMIP3  are from Knutti and Sedlaek  obtained using the method of Meinshausen et al.  and are calculated for the slightly different future period 2081-2100 to be consistent with the rest of this chapter, and are expressed with respect to the AR5 baseline period of 1986-2005. The box-and-whiskers fourth from the left are a graphical representation of the numbers shown in Table 12.2. The final box-and-whiskers on the right is a combination of CMIP5 model output and emulation of CMIP5 RCP6.0 numbers for those models that did not run RCP6.0.	0

MAGICC models with parameters chosen to emulate the response of the CMIP3 models to RCP6.0 forcing, with anomalies expressed with respect to the 1986-2005 baseline period . They too find a larger mean response in the CMIP5 case but also a larger spread  in CMIP5. Uncertainties in the different approaches to emulating climate model simulations, for example estimating the non-GHG RF, and the small sample sizes of CMIP3 and CMIP5 make it difficult to draw conclusions on the statistical significance of the differences displayed in Figure 12.39, but the same uncertainties lead us to conclude that on the basis of these analyses there appears to be no fundamental difference between the behaviour of the CMIP5 ensemble, in comparison with CMIP3.	0
It would be extremely costly computationally to rerun the full CMIP3 ensemble under the new RCPs and/or the full CMIP5 ensemble under the old SRES scenarios in order to separate model and scenario effects. In the absence of a direct comparison, we rely on simplified modelling frameworks to emulate CMIP3/5 SRES/RCP model behaviour and compare them. Figure 12.39 shows an emulation of the global mean temperature response at the end of the 21st century that one would expect from the CMIP5 models if they were run under SRES A1B. In this case, anomalies are computed with respect to 1980-1999 for direct comparison with the values reported in AR4  which used that baseline. The method used to emulate the SRES A1B response of the CMIP5 is documented by Good et al. . Ensemble-mean A1B RF was computed from CMIP3 projections using the Forster and Taylor  method, scaled to ensure consistency with the forcing required by the method. The simple model is only used to predict the temperature difference between A1B and RCP8.5, and between A1B and RCP4.5 separately for each model. These differences are then added to CMIP5 GCM simulations of RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 respectively, and averaged to give a single A1B estimate. The emulated CMIP5 SRES A1B results show a slightly larger mean response than the actual CMIP3 models, with a similar spread . The main reason for this is the slightly larger mean transient climate response  in the subset of CMIP5 models available in comparison with the AR4 CMIP3 models. An alternative emulation is presented by Knutti and Sedlaek  who use the simplified	0

Figure 12.41 | Patterns of temperature  and percent precipitation change  for the CMIP3 models average  and CMIP5 models average , scaled by the corresponding global average temperature changes. The patterns are computed in both cases by taking the difference between the averages over the last 20 years of the 21st century experiments  and the last twenty years of the historic experiments  and rescaling each difference by the corresponding change in global average temperature. This is done first for each individual model, and then the results are averaged across models. For the CMIP5 patterns, the RCP2.6 simulation of the FIO-ESM model was excluded because it did not show any warming by the end of the 21st century, thus not complying with the method requirement that the pattern be estimated at a time when the temperature change signal from CO2 increase has emerged. Stippling indicates a measure of significance of the difference between the two corresponding patterns obtained by a bootstrap exercise. Two subsets of the pooled set of CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensemble members of the same size as the original ensembles, but without distinguishing CMIP3 from CMIP5 members, were randomly sampled 500 times. For each random sample we compute the corresponding patterns and their difference, then the true difference is compared, grid-point by grid-point, to the distribution of the bootstrapped differences, and only grid-points at which the value of the difference falls in the tails of the bootstrapped distribution  are stippled.	0
CMIP3/C4MIP but a more general uncertainty characterization for key quantities like equilibrium climate sensitivity, similarly to the approach utilized by Meinshausen et al. . Observational or other historical constraints are also used in this study and the analysis is consistent with the overall assessment of sources and ranges of uncertainties for relevant quantities  from AR4 . Figure 12.40 summarizes results of this probabilistic comparison for global temperature. The RCPs span a large range of stabilization, mitigation and non-mitigation pathways and the resulting range of temperature changes are larger than those produced under SRES scenarios, which do not consider mitigation options. The SRES results span an interval between just above 1.0C and 6.5C when considering the respective likely ranges of all scenarios, including B1 as the lowest and A1FI as the highest. Emissions under RCP8.5 are highest and the resulting temperature changes likely range from 4.0C to 6.1C by 2100. The lowest RCP2.6 assumes significant mitigation and the global temperature change likely remains below 2C.	0
Similar temperature change projections by the end of the 21st century are obtained under RCP8.5 and SRES A1FI, RCP6 and SRES B2 and RCP4.5 and SRES B1. There remain large differences though in the transient trajectories, with rates of change slower or faster for the different pairs. These differences can be traced back to the interplay of the  short-term effect of sulphate aerosols and the  effect of long-lived GHGs. Impact studies may be sensitive to the differences in these temporal profiles so care should be taken in approximating SRES with RCPs and vice versa. While simple models can separate the effect of the scenarios and the model response, no studies are currently available that allow an attribution of the CMIP3-CMIP5 differences to changes in the transient climate response, the carbon cycle, and the inclusion of new processes . The fact that these sets of CMIP3 and CMIP5 experiments do not include emission-driven runs would suggest that differences in the representation of the carbon cycle are very unlikely to explain differences in the simulations, since the only 1101	0
effect of changes in the carbon cycle representation would affect the land surface, and thus would have only a minor effect on the climate response at the global scale. Figure 12.41 shows a comparison of the patterns of warming and precipitation change from CMIP3  and CMIP5 , utilizing the pattern scaling methodology . The geographic patterns of mean change are very similar across the two ensembles of models, with pattern correlations of 0.98 for temperature and 0.90 for precipitation changes. However there exist significant differences in the absolute values of the patterns, if not in their geographic shapes. A simple bootstrapping exercise that pooled together all models and scenarios and resampled 500 times the same numbers of models/scenarios divided into two groups, but without distinguishing CMIP3 from CMIP5  allows to compute a measure of significance of the actual differences in the patterns. Stippling in Figure 12.41 marks the large regions where the difference is significant for temperature and precipitation patterns. The temperature pattern from CMIP5 shows significantly larger warming per degree Celsius of global mean temperature change in the NH and less warming per degree Celsius in the SH compared to the corresponding pattern from CMIP3. For precipitation patterns, CMIP5 shows significantly larger increases per degree Celsius in the NH and significantly larger decreases per degree Celsius in the SH compared to CMIP3. Even in this case we do not have studies that allow tracing the source of these differences to specific changes in models' configurations, processes represented or scenarios run. Knutti and Sedlaek  attempt to identify or rule out at least some of these sources. Differences in model projections spread or its counterpart, robustness, between CMIP3 and CMIP5 are discussed, and it is shown that by comparing the behaviour of only a subset of 11 models, contributed to the two CMIPs by the same group of institutions, the robustness of CMIP5 versus that of CMIP3 actually decreases slightly. This would suggest that the enhanced robustness of CMIP5 is not clearly attributable to advances in modelling, and may be a result of the fact that the CMIP5 ensemble contains different versions of the same model that are counted as independent in this measure of robustness.	0
The CMIP5 intercomparison project includes simulations extending the four RCP scenarios to the year 2300 . This allows exploring the longer-term climate response to idealized GHG and aerosols forcings . Continuing GHG emissions beyond 2100 as in the RCP8.5 extension induces a total RF above 12 W m-2 by 2300, while sustaining negative emissions beyond 2100, as in the RCP2.6 extension, induces a total RF below 2 W m-2 by 2300. The projected warming for 2281-2300, relative to 1986-2005, is 0.6C  for RCP2.6, 2.5C  for RCP4.5, and 7.8C  for RCP8.5  . EMICs simulations have been performed following the same CMIP5 protocol for the historical simulation and RCP scenarios extended to 2300 . These scenarios have been prolonged beyond 2300 to investigate longer-term commitment and irreversibility . Up to 2300, projected warming and the reduction of the AMOC as simulated by the EMICs are similar to those simulated by the CMIP5 ESMs .	0
Climate change commitment, the fact that the climate will change further after the forcing or emissions have been eliminated or held constant, has attracted increased attention by scientists and policymakers shortly before the completion of IPCC AR4  . However, the argument that the surface response would lag the RF due to the large thermal reservoir of the ocean in fact goes back much longer . The discussion in this section is framed largely in terms of temperature change, but other changes in the climate system  are closely related to changes in temperature . A summary of how past emissions relate to future warming is also given in FAQ 12.3. The Earth system has multiple response time scales related to different thermal reservoirs . For a step change in forcing , a large fraction of the total of the surface temperature response will be realized within years to a few decades . The remaining response, realized over centuries, is controlled by the slow mixing of the energy perturbation into the ocean . The response time scale depends on the amount of ocean mixing	0
and the strength of climate feedbacks, and is longer for higher climate sensitivity . The transient climate response is therefore smaller than the equilibrium response, in particular for high climate sensitivities. This can also be interpreted as the ocean heat uptake being a negative feedback . Delayed responses can also occur due to processes other than ocean warming, for example, vegetation change  or ice sheet melt that continues long after the forcing has been stabilized . Several forms of commitment are often discussed in the literature. The most common is the `constant composition commitment', the warming that would occur after stabilizing all radiative constituents at a given year  levels. For year 2000 commitment, AOGCMs estimated a most likely value of about 0.6C for 2100 . A present-day composition commitment simulation is not part of CMIP5, so direct comparison with CMIP3 is not possible. However, the available CMIP5 results based on the RCP4.5 extension with constant RF  are consistent with those numbers, with an additional warming of about 0.5C 200 years after stabilization of the forcing .	0
A measure of constant composition commitment is the fraction of realized warming which can be estimated as the ratio of the warming at a given time to the long-term equilibrium warming . EMIC simulations have been performed with RCPs forcing up to 2300 prolonged until the end of the millennium with a constant forcing set at the value reached by 2300 . When the forcing stabilizes, the fraction of realized warming is significantly below unity. However, the fraction of realized warming depends on the history of the forcing. For the RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 extension scenarios with early stabilization, it is about 75% at the time of forcing stabilization; while for RCP8.5, with stabilization occurring later, it is about 85% ; but for a 1% yr-1 CO2 increase to 2 x CO2 or 4 x CO2 and constant forcing thereafter, the fraction of realized warming is much smaller, about 40 to 70% at the time when the forcing is kept constant. The fraction of realized warming rises typically by 10% over the century following the stabilization of forcing. Due to the long time scales in the deep ocean, full equilibrium is reached only after hundreds to thousands of years .	0
`Constant emission commitment' is the warming that would result from maintaining annual anthropogenic emissions at the current level. Few studies exist but it is estimated to be about 1C to 2.5C by 2100 assuming constant  emissions in the future, based on the MAGICC model calibrated to CMIP3 and C4MIP models  . Such a scenario is different from non-intervention economic scenarios, and it does not stabilize global temperature, as any plausible emission path after 2100 would cause further warming. It is also different from a constant cumulative emission scenario which implies zero emissions in the future.	0
Another form of commitment involves climate change when anthropogenic emissions are set to zero . Results from a variety of models ranging from EMICs  to ESMs  show that abruptly setting CO2 emissions to zero  results in approximately constant global temperature for several centuries onward. Those results indicate that past emissions commit us to persistent warming for hundreds of years, continuing at about the level of warming that has been realized. On near equilibrium time scales of a few centuries to about a millennium, the temperature response to CO2 emissions is controlled by climate sensitivity  and the cumulative airborne fraction of CO2 over these time scales. After about a thousand years  and cumulative CO2 emissions less than about 2000 PgC, approximately 20 to 30% of the cumulative anthropogenic carbon emissions still remain in the atmosphere   and maintain a substantial temperature response long after emissions have ceased . In the transient phase, on a 100- to 1000-year time scale, the approximately constant temperature results from a compensation between delayed commitment warming  and the reduction in atmospheric CO2 resulting from ocean and land carbon uptake as well as from the nonlinear dependence of RF on atmospheric CO2 . The commitment associated with past emissions depends, as mentioned above, on the value of climate sensitivity and cumulative CO2 airborne fraction, but it also depends on the choices made for other RF constituents. In a CO2 only case and for equilibrium climate sensitivities near 3C, the warming commitment  is near zero or slightly negative. For high climate sensitivities, and in particular if aerosol emissions are eliminated at the same time, the commitment from past emission can be significantly positive, and is a superposition of a fast response to reduced aerosols emissions and a slow response associated with high climate sensitivities  . In the real world, the emissions of CO2 and non-CO2 forcing agents are of course coupled. All of the above studies support the conclusion that temperatures would decrease only very slowly , 1104	0

over the course of the millennium. Larger forcings induce longer delays before the Earth system would reach equilibrium. For RCP8.5, by year 3000  global temperature has decreased only by 1C to 2C  and ocean thermal expansion has almost doubled  and is still increasing . The previous paragraph discussed climate change commitment from GHGs that have already been emitted. Another form of commitment refers to climate change associated with heat and carbon that has gone into the land surface and oceans. This would be relevant to the consequences of a one-time removal of all of the excess CO2 in the atmosphere and is computed by taking a transient simulation and instantaneously setting atmospheric CO2 concentrations to initial  values . In such an extreme case, there would be a net flux of CO2 from the ocean and land surface to the atmosphere, releasing an amount of CO2 representing about 30% of what was removed from the atmosphere, i.e., the airborne fraction applies equally to positive and negative emissions, and it depends on the emissions history. A related form of experiment investigates the consequences of an initial complete removal followed by sustained removal of any CO2 returned to the atmosphere from the land surface and oceans, and is computed by setting atmospheric CO2 concentrations to pre-industrial values and maintaining this concentration . In this case, only about one-tenth of the pre-existing temperature perturbation persists for more than half of a century. A similar study performed with a GFDL AOGCM where forcing was instantaneously returned to its pre-industrial value, found larger residual warming, up to 30% of the pre-existing warming . Several studies on commitment to past emissions have demonstrated that the persistence of warming is substantially longer than the lifetime of anthropogenic GHGs themselves, as a result of nonlinear absorption effects as well as the slow heat transfer into and out of the ocean. In much the same way as the warming to a step increase of forcing is delayed, the cooling after setting RF to zero is also delayed. Loss of excess heat from the ocean will lead to a positive surface air temperature anomaly for decades to centuries . A more general form of commitment is the question of how much warming we are committed to as a result of inertia and hence commitments related to the time scales for energy system transitions and other societal, economic and technological aspects . For example, Davis et al.  estimated climate commitment of 1.3C  from existing CO2-emitting devices under specific assumptions regarding their lifetimes. These forms of commitment, however, are strongly based on political, economic and social assumptions that are outside the domain of IPCC WGI and are not further considered here.	0
response of a model to an external forcing perturbation. However, there are limitations to the concept of RF , and the separation of forcings and fast  responses  is sometimes difficult . Equilibrium warming also depends on the type of forcing . ECS is time or state dependent in some models , and in some but not all models climate sensitivity from a slab ocean version differs from that of coupled models or the effective climate sensitivity  diagnosed from a transient coupled integration . The computational cost of coupled AOGCMs is often prohibitively large to run simulations to full equilibrium, and only a few models have performed those . Because of the time dependence of effective climate sensitivity, fitting simple models to AOGCMs over the first few centuries may lead to errors when inferring the response on multi-century time scales. In the HadCM3 case the long-term warming would be underestimated by 30% if extrapolated from the first century , in other models the warming of the slab and coupled model is almost identical . The assumption that the response to different forcings is approximately additive appears to be justified for large-scale temperature changes but limited for other climate variables . A more complete discussion of the concept of ECS and the limitations is given in Knutti and Hegerl . The CMIP5 model estimates of ECS and TCR are also discussed in Section 9.7. Despite all limitations, the ECS and TCR remain key concepts to characterize the transient and near equilibrium warming as a response to RF on time scales of centuries. Their overall assessment is given in Box 12.2. A number of recent studies suggest that equilibrium climate sensitivities determined from AOGCMs and recent warming trends may significantly underestimate the true Earth system sensitivity  which is realized when equilibration is reached on millennial time scales . The argument is that slow feedbacks associated with vegetation changes and ice sheets have their own intrinsic long time scales and are not represented in most models . Additional feedbacks are mostly thought to be positive but negative feedbacks of smaller magnitude are also simulated . The climate sensitivity of a model may therefore not reflect the sensitivity of the full Earth system because those feedback processes are not considered . Feedbacks determined in very different base state  differ from those in the current warm period , and relationships between observables and climate sensitivity are model dependent .

FAQ 12.3 | What Would Happen to Future Climate if We Stopped Emissions Today? Stopping emissions today is a scenario that is not plausible, but it is one of several idealized cases that provide insight into the response of the climate system and carbon cycle. As a result of the multiple time scales in the climate system, the relation between change in emissions and climate response is quite complex, with some changes still occurring long after emissions ceased. Models and process understanding show that as a result of the large ocean inertia and the long lifetime of many greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, much of the warming would persist for centuries after greenhouse gas emissions have stopped. When emitted in the atmosphere, greenhouse gases get removed through chemical reactions with other reactive components or, in the case of carbon dioxide , get exchanged with the ocean and the land. These processes characterize the lifetime of the gas in the atmosphere, defined as the time it takes for a concentration pulse to decrease by a factor of e . How long greenhouse gases and aerosols persist in the atmosphere varies over a wide range, from days to thousands of years. For example, aerosols have a lifetime of weeks, methane  of about 10 years, nitrous oxide  of about 100 years and hexafluoroethane  of about 10,000 years. CO2 is more complicated as it is removed from the atmosphere through multiple physical and biogeochemical processes in the ocean and the land; all operating at different time scales. For an emission pulse of about 1000 PgC, about half is removed within a few decades, but the remaining fraction stays in the atmosphere for much longer. About 15 to 40% of the CO2 pulse is still in the atmosphere after 1000 years. As a result of the significant lifetimes of major anthropogenic greenhouse gases, the increased atmospheric concentration due to past emissions will persist long after emissions are ceased. Concentration of greenhouse gases would not return immediately to their pre-industrial levels if emissions were halted. Methane concentration would return to values close to pre-industrial level in about 50 years, N2O concentrations would need several centuries, while CO2 would essentially never come back to its pre-industrial level on time scales relevant for our society. Changes in emissions of short-lived species like aerosols on the other hand would result in nearly instantaneous changes in their concentrations.	0
The climate system response to the greenhouse gases and aerosols forcing is characterized by an inertia, driven mainly by the ocean. The ocean has a very large capacity of absorbing heat and a slow mixing between the surface and the deep ocean. This means that it will take several centuries for the whole ocean to warm up and to reach equilibrium with the altered radiative forcing. The surface ocean  will continue to warm until it reaches a surface temperature in equilibrium with this new radiative forcing. The AR4 showed that if concentration of greenhouse gases were held constant at present day level, the Earth surface would still continue to warm by about 0.6C over the 21st century relative to the year 2000. This is the climate commitment to current concentrations , shown in grey in FAQ 12.3, Figure 1. Constant emissions at current levels would further increase the atmospheric concentration and result in much more warming than observed so far .	0

climate response of the Earth System to that radiative forcing would be even slower. Global temperature would not respond quickly to the greenhouse gas concentration changes. Eliminating CO2 emissions only would lead to near constant temperature for many centuries. Eliminating short-lived negative forcings from sulphate aerosols at the same time  would cause a temporary warming of a few tenths of a degree, as shown in blue in FAQ 12.3, Figure 1. Setting all emissions to zero would therefore, after a short warming, lead to a near stabilization of the climate for multiple centuries. This is called the commitment from past emissions . The concentration of GHG would decrease and hence the radiative forcing as well, but the inertia of the climate system would delay the temperature response. As a consequence of the large inertia in the climate and carbon cycle, the long-term global temperature is largely controlled by total CO2 emissions that have accumulated over time, irrespective of the time when they were emitted. Limiting global warming below a given level  therefore implies a given budget of CO2, that is, higher emissions earlier implies stronger reductions later. A higher climate target allows for a higher CO2 concentration peak, and hence larger cumulative CO2 emissions . Global temperature is a useful aggregate number to describe the magnitude of climate change, but not all changes will scale linearly global temperature. Changes in the water cycle for example also depend on the type of forcing , slower components of the Earth system such as sea level rise and ice sheet would take much longer to respond, and there may be critical thresholds or abrupt or irreversible changes in the climate system.	0
Equilibrium climate sensitivity undoubtedly remains a key quantity, useful to relate a change in GHGs or other forcings to a global temperature change. But the above caveats imply that estimates based on past climate states very different from today, estimates based on time scales different than those relevant for climate stabilization , or based on forcings other than GHGs  may differ from the climate sensitivity measuring the climate feedbacks of the Earth system today, and this measure, in turn, may be slightly different from the sensitivity of the Earth in a much warmer state on time scales of millennia. The TCR and the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions  are often more directly relevant to evaluate short term changes and emission reductions needed for stabilization .	0
The concept of stabilization is strongly linked to the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, which is `to achieve  stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system'. Recent policy discussions focussed on a global temperature increase, rather than on GHG concentrations. The most prominent target currently discussed is the 2C temperature target, that is, to limit global temperature increase relative to pre-industrial times to below 2C. The 2C target has been used first by the European Union as a policy target in 1996 but can be traced further back . Climate impacts however are geographically diverse  and sector specific, and no objective threshold defines when dangerous interference is reached. Some changes may be delayed or irreversible, and some impacts are likely to be beneficial. It is thus not possible to define a single critical threshold without value judgments and without assumptions on how to aggregate current and future costs and benefits. Targets other than 2C have been proposed , or targets based on CO2 concentration levels, for example, 350 ppm . The rate of change may also be important . This section does not advocate or defend any threshold, nor does it judge 1107	0
The total amount of anthropogenic CO2 released in the atmosphere  is a good indicator of the atmospheric CO2 concentration and hence of the global warming response to CO2. The ratio of global temperature change to total cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions  is relatively constant over time and independent of the scenario, but is model dependent as it depends on the model cumulative airborne fraction of CO2 and ECS/ TCR . This is consistent with an earlier study indicating that the global warming potential of CO2 is approximately independent of the scenario . The concept of a constant ratio of cumulative emissions of CO2 to temperature holds well only until temperatures peak  and only for smoothly varying cumulative CO2 emissions . It does not hold for stabilization on millennial time scales or for non-CO2 forcings, and there is limited evidence for its applicability for cumulative emissions exceeding 2000 PgC owing to limited simulations available . For non-CO2 forcings with shorter atmospheric life times than CO2 the rate of emissions at the time of peak warming is more important than the cumulative emissions over time .	0
Also some models prescribe only CO2 emissions while others use multi gas scenarios, and the time horizons differ. The warming is usually larger if non-CO2 forcings are considered, since the net effect of the non-CO2 forcings is positive in most scenarios . Not all numbers are therefore directly comparable. Matthews et al.  estimated the TCRE as 1C to 2.1C per 1000 PgC   based on the C4MIP model range . The ENSEMBLES E1 show a range of 1C to 4C per 1000 PgC  . Rogelj et al.  estimate a 5 to 95% range of about 1C to 2C per 1000 PgC  based on the MAGICC model calibrated to the C4MIP model range and the likely range of 2C to 4.5C for climate sensitivity given in AR4. Allen et al.  used a simple model and found 1.3C to 3.9C per 1000 PgC  for peak warming  and 1.4C to 2.5C for TCRE. The EMICs TCRE simulations suggest a range of about 1.4C to 2.5C per 1000 PgC and a mean of 1.9C per 1000 PgC  . The results of Meinshausen et al.  confirm the approximate linearity between temperature and CO2 emissions . Their results are difficult to compare owing to the shorter time period considered, but the model was found to be consistent with that of Allen et al. . Zickfeld et al. , using an EMIC, find a best estimate of about 1.5C per 1000 PgC. Gillett et al.  find a range of 0.8C to 2.4C per 1000 PgC in 15 CMIP5 models and derive an observationally constrained range of 0.7C to 2.0C per 1000 PgC. Results from much earlier model studies support the near linear relationship of cumulative emissions and global temperature, even though these studies did not discuss the linear relationship. An example is given in Figure 12.45c based on data shown in IPCC TAR Figure 13.3  and IPCC AR4 Figure 10.35 . The relationships between cumulative CO2 emissions and temperature in CMIP5 are shown in Figure 12.45f for the 1% yr-1 CO2 increase scenarios and in Figure 12.45i for the RCP8.5 emission driven ESM simulations . Compatible emissions from concentration driven CMIP5 ESMs are discussed in Section 6.4.3.3.	0
Expert judgement based on the available evidence therefore suggests that the TCRE is likely between 0.8C to 2.5C per 1000 PgC, for cumulative CO2 emissions less than about 2000 PgC until the time at which temperature peaks. Under these conditions, and for low to medium estimates of climate sensitivity, the TCRE is nearly identical to the peak climate response to cumulative carbon emissions. For high climate sensitivity, strong carbon cycle climate feedbacks or large cumulative emissions, the peak warming can be delayed and the peak response may be different from TCRE, but is often poorly constrained by models and observations. The range of TCRE assessed here is consistent with other recent attempts to synthesize the available evidence . The results by Schwartz et al.  imply a much larger warming for the carbon emitted over the historical period and have been questioned by Knutti and Plattner  for neglecting the relevant response time scales and combining a transient airborne fraction with an equilibrium climate sensitivity.	0
1000 years of about 25  5% . Again combining the extreme values would suggest a range of 0.6C to 2.7C per 1000 PgC, and 1.5C per 1000 PgC for an ECS of 3C and a cumulative airborne fraction of 25%. However, this equilibrium estimate is based on feedbacks estimated for the present day climate. Climate and carbon cycle feedbacks may increase substantially on long time scales and for high cumulative CO2 emissions , introducing large uncertainties in particular on the upper bound. Based on paleoclimate data and an analytical model, Goodwin et al.  estimate a long term RF of 1.5 W m-2 for an emission of 1000 PgC. For an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3C this corresponds to a warming of 1.2C on millennial time scales, consistent with the climate carbon cycle models results discussed above.	0

Box 12.2 | Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity and Transient Climate Response Equilibrium climate sensitivity  and transient climate response  are useful metrics summarizing the global climate system's temperature response to an externally imposed radiative forcing . ECS is defined as the equilibrium change in annual mean global surface temperature following a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration , while TCR is defined as the annual mean global surface temperature change at the time of CO2 doubling following a linear increase in CO2 forcing over a period of 70 years . Both metrics have a broader application than these definitions imply: ECS determines the eventual warming in response to stabilization of atmospheric composition on multi-century time scales, while TCR determines the warming expected at a given time following any steady increase in forcing over a 50- to 100-year time scale. ECS and TCR can be estimated from various lines of evidence. The estimates can be based on the values of ECS and TCR diagnosed from climate models , or they can be constrained by analysis of feedbacks in climate models , patterns of mean climate and variability in models compared to observations , temperature fluctuations as reconstructed from paleoclimate archives , observed and modelled short-term perturbations of the energy balance like those caused by volcanic eruptions , and the observed surface and ocean temperature trends since pre-industrial . For many applications, the limitations of the forcing-feedback analysis framework and the dependence of feedbacks on time scales and the climate state  must be kept in mind. Some studies estimate the TCR as the ratio of global mean temperature change to RF  . Those estimates are scaled by the RF of 2 x CO2  to be comparable to TCR in the following discussion. Newer studies of constraints based on the observed warming since pre-industrial, analysed using simple and intermediate complexity models, improved statistical methods, and several different and newer data sets, are assessed in detail in Section 10.8.2. Together with results from feedback analysis and paleoclimate constraints , but without considering the CMIP based evidence, these studies show ECS is likely between 1.5C to 4.5C  and extremely unlikely less than 1.0C . A few studies argued for very low values of climate sensitivity, but many of them have received criticism in the literature . Estimates based on AOGCMs and feedback analysis indicate a range of 2C to 4.5C, with the CMIP5 model mean at 3.2C, similar to CMIP3. A summary of published ranges and PDFs of ECS is given in Box 12.2, Figure 1. Distributions and ranges for the TCR are shown in Box 12.2, Figure 2.	0
Simultaneously imposing different constraints from the observed warming trends, volcanic eruptions, model climatology, and paleoclimate, for example, by using a distribution obtained from the Last Glacial Maximum as a prior for the 20th century analysis, yields a more narrow range for climate sensitivity  . However, such methods are sensitive to assumptions of independence of the various lines of evidence, which might have shared biases , and the assumption that each individual line of evidence is unbiased and its uncertainties are captured completely. Expert elicitations for PDFs of climate sensitivity exist , but have also received some criticism . They are not used formally here because the experts base their opinion on the same studies as we assess. The peer-reviewed literature provides no consensus on a 	0
Based on the combined evidence from observed climate change including the observed 20th century warming, climate models, feedback analysis and paleoclimate, ECS is likely in the range 1.5C to 4.5C with high confidence. The combined evidence increases the confidence in this final assessment compared to that based on the observed warming and paleoclimate only. ECS is positive, extremely unlikely less than 1C , and very Schwartz  unlikely greater than 6C . The upper limit of Libardoni & Forest  the likely range is unchanged compared to AR4. The lower limit of Padilla et al  the likely range of 1.5C is less than the lower limit of 2C in AR4. Gregory & Forster  Stott & Forest  This change reflects the evidence from new studies of observed Gillett et al  temperature change, using the extended records in atmosphere Tung et al  and ocean. These studies suggest a best fit to the observed surOtto et al   face and ocean warming for ECS values in the lower part of the Otto et al   likely range. Note that these studies are not purely observationRogelj et al  Harris et al  al, because they require an estimate of the response to RF from Meinshausen et al  models. In addition, the uncertainty in ocean heat uptake remains Knutti & Tomassini   substantial . Accounting for short Knutti & Tomassini   term variability in simple models remains challenging, and it is 1.5 important not to give undue weight to any short time period that might be strongly affected by internal variability . On the other hand, AOGCMs show very good agreement with 1 observed climatology with ECS values in the upper part of the 1.5C to 4.5C range , but the simulation of key feedbacks like clouds remains challenging in those models. The Black histogram CMIP5 models estimates from the observed warming, paleoclimate, and from Dashed lines 0.5 AR4 studies climate models are consistent within their uncertainties, each is supported by many studies and multiple data sets, and in combination they provide high confidence for the assessed likely range.

The tails of the ECS distribution are now better understood. Multiple lines of evidence provide high confidence that an ECS value less than 1C is extremely unlikely. The assessment that ECS is very unlikely greater than 6C is an expert judgment informed by several lines of evidence. First, the comprehensive climate models used in the CMIP5 exercise produce an ECS range of 2.1C to 4.7C , very similar to CMIP3. Second, comparisons of perturbed-physics ensembles against the observed climate find that models with ECS values in the range 3C to 4C show the smallest errors for many fields . Third, there is increasing evidence that the aerosol RF of the 20th century is not strongly negative, which makes it unlikely that the observed warming was caused by a very large ECS in response to a very small net forcing. Fourth, multiple and at least partly independent observational constraints from the satellite period, instrumental period and palaeoclimate studies continue to yield very low probabilities for ECS larger than 6C, particularly when including most recent ocean and atmospheric data . Analyses of observations and simulations of the instrumental period are estimating the effective climate sensitivity , rather than ECS directly. In some climate models ECS tends to be higher than the effective climate sensitivity , because the feedbacks that are represented in the models 	0
rate, albedo and clouds) vary with the climate state. On time scales of many centuries, additional feedbacks with their own intrinsic time scales   may become important but are not usually modelled. The resulting Earth system sensitivity is less well constrained but likely to be larger than ECS , implying that lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations are needed to meet a given temperature target on multi-century time scales. A number of caveats, however, apply to those studies . Those long-term feedbacks have their own intrinsic time scales, and are less likely to be proportional to global mean temperature change. For scenarios of increasing RF, TCR is a more informative indicator of future climate than ECS . This assessment concludes with high confidence that the TCR is likely in the range 1C to 2.5C, close to the estimated 5 to 95% range of CMIP5 , is positive and extremely unlikely greater than 3C. As with the ECS, this is an expert-assessed range, supported by several different and partly independent lines of evidence, each based on multiple studies, models and data sets. TCR is estimated from the observed global changes in surface temperature, ocean heat uptake and RF, the detection/attribution studies identifying the response patterns to increasing GHG concentrations , and the results of CMIP3 and CMIP5 . Estimating TCR suffers from fewer difficulties in terms of state- or time-dependent feedbacks , and is less affected by uncertainty as to how much energy is taken up by the ocean. Unlike ECS, the ranges of TCR estimated from the observed warming and from AOGCMs agree well, increasing our confidence in the assessment of uncertainties in projections over the 21st century. Another useful metric relating directly CO2 emissions to temperature is the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emission  . This metric is useful to determine the allowed cumulative carbon emissions for stabilization at a specific global temperature. TCRE is defined as the annual mean global surface temperature change per unit of cumulated CO2 emissions, usually 1000 PgC, in a scenario with continuing emissions . It considers physical and carbon cycle feedbacks and uncertainties, but not additional feedbacks associated for example with the release of methane hydrates or large amounts of carbon from permafrost. The assessment based on climate models as well as the observed warming suggests that the TCRE is likely between 0.8C to 2.5C per 1000 PgC , for cumulative CO2 emissions less than about 2000 PgC until the time at which temperatures peak. Under these conditions, and for low to medium estimates of climate sensitivity, the TCRE gives an accurate estimate of the peak global mean temperature response to cumulated carbon emissions. TCRE has the advantage of directly relating global mean surface temperature change to CO2 emissions, but as a result of combining the uncertainty in both TCR and the carbon cycle response, it is more uncertain. It also ignores non-CO2 forcings and the fact that other components of the climate system  have their own intrinsic time scales, resulting in climate change not avoided by limiting global temperature change.	0
One difficulty with the concepts of climate stabilization and targets is that stabilization of global temperature does not imply stabilization for all aspects of the climate system. For example, some models show significant hysteresis behaviour in the global water cycle, because global precipitation depends on both atmospheric CO2 and temperature . Processes related to vegetation changes  or changes in the ice sheets  as well as ocean acidification, deep ocean warming and associated sea level rise  , and potential feedbacks linking, for example, ocean and the ice sheets , have their own intrinsic long time scales. Those will result in significant changes hundreds to thousands of years after global temperature is stabilized. Thermal expansion, in contrast to global mean temperature, also depends on the evolution of surface temperature .	0
The simplicity of the concept of a cumulative carbon emission budget makes it attractive for policy . The principal driver of long term warming is the total cumulative emission of CO2 over time. To limit warming caused by CO2 emissions to a given temperature target, cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources therefore need to be limited to a certain budget. Higher emissions in earlier decades simply imply lower emissions by the same amount later on. This is illustrated in the RCP2.6 scenario in Figure 12.46a/b. Two idealized emission pathways with initially higher emissions  eventually lead to the same warming if emissions are then reduced much more rapidly. Even a stepwise emission pathway with levels constant at 2010 and zero near mid-century would eventually lead to a similar warming as they all have identical cumulative emissions. However, several aspects related to the concept of a cumulative carbon emission budget should be kept in mind. The ratio of global temperature and cumulative carbon is only approximately constant. It is the result of an interplay of several compensating carbon cycle and climate	0
feedback processes operating on different time scales  . It depends on the modelled climate sensitivity and carbon cycle feedbacks. Thus, the allowed emissions for a given temperature target are uncertain  . Nevertheless, the relationship is nearly linear in all models. Most models do not consider the possibility that long term feedbacks  may be different . Despite the fact that stabilization refers to equilibrium, the results assessed here are primarily relevant for the next few centuries and may differ for millennial scales. Notably, many of these limitations apply similarly to other policy targets, for example, stabilizing the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Non-CO2 forcing constituents are important, which requires either assumptions on how CO2 emission reductions are linked to changes in other forcings , or separate emission budgets and climate modelling for short-lived and long-lived gases. So far, many studies ignored non-CO2 forcings altogether. Those that consider them find significant effects, in particular warming of several tenths of a degree for abrupt reductions in emissions of short-lived species, like aerosols  . Other studies, which model reductions that explicitly target warming from short-lived non-CO2 species only, find important short-term cooling benefits shortly after the reduction of these species , but do not extend beyond 2030. The concept of cumulative carbon also implies that higher initial emissions can be compensated by a faster decline in emissions later or by negative emissions. However, in the real world short-term and longterm goals are not independent and mitigation rates are limited by economic constraints and existing infrastructure . An analysis of 193 published emission pathways with an energy balance model  is shown in Figure 12.46c, d. Those emission pathways that likely limit warming below 2C  by 2100 show emissions of about 31 to 46 Pg yr-1 and 17 to 23 Pg yr-1 by 2020 and 2050, respectively. Median 2010 emissions of all models are 48 Pg yr-1. Note that, as opposed to Figure 12.46a, b, many scenarios still have positive emissions in 2100. As these will not be zero immediately after 2100, they imply that the warming may exceed the target after 2100. The aspects discussed above do not limit the robustness of the overall scientific assessment, but highlight factors that need to be considered when determining cumulative CO2 emissions consistent with a given temperature target. In conclusion, taking into account the available information from multiple lines of evidence , the near linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and peak global mean temperature is well established in the literature and robust for cumulative total CO2 emissions up to about 2000 PgC. It is consistent with the relationship inferred	0
from past cumulative CO2 emissions and observed warming, is supported by process understanding of the carbon cycle and global energy balance, and emerges as a robust result from the entire hierarchy of models. Using a best estimate for the TCRE would provide a most likely value for the cumulative CO2 emissions compatible with stabilization at a given temperature. However, such a budget would imply about 50% probability for staying below the temperature target. Higher probabilities for staying below a temperature or concentration target require significantly lower budgets . Based on the assessment of TCRE , limiting the warming caused by anthropogenic CO2 emissions alone  to less than 2C since the period 1861-1880 with a probability of >33%, >50% and >66%, total CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources would need to be below a cumulative budget of about 1570 PgC, 1210 PgC and 1000 PgC since 1870, respectively. An amount of 515  PgC was emitted between 1870 and 2011. Accounting for non-CO2 forcings contributing to peak warming, or requiring a higher likelihood of temperatures remaining below 2C, both imply lower cumulative CO2 emissions. A possible release of GHGs from permafrost or methane hydrates, not accounted for in current models, would also further reduce the anthropogenic CO2 emissions compatible with a given temperature target. When accounting for the non-CO2 forcings as in the RCP scenarios, compatible carbon emissions since 1870 are reduced to about 900 PgC, 820 PgC and 790 PgC to limit warming to less than 2C since the period 1861-1880 with a probability of >33%, >50%, and >66%, respectively. These estimates were derived by computing the fraction of CMIP5 ESMs and EMICs that stay below 2C for given cumulative emissions following RCP8.5, as shown in TFE.8 Figure 1c. The non-CO2 forcing in RCP8.5 is higher than in RCP2.6. Because all likelihood statements in calibrated IPCC language are open intervals, the provided estimates are thus both conservative and consistent choices valid for non-CO2 forcings across all RCP scenarios. There is no RCP scenario which limits warming to 2C with probabilities of >33% or >50%, and which could be used to directly infer compatible cumulative emissions. For a probability of >66% RCP2.6 can be used as a comparison. Combining the average back-calculated fossil fuel carbon emissions for RCP2.6 between 2012 and 2100  with the average historical estimate of 515 PgC gives a total of 785 PgC, i.e., 790 PgC when rounded to 10 PgC. As the 785 PgC estimate excludes an explicit assessment of future land-use change emissions, the 790 PgC value also remains a conservative estimate consistent with the overall likelihood assessment. The ranges of emissions for these three likelihoods based on the RCP scenarios are rather narrow, as they are based on a single scenario and on the limited sample of models available . In contrast to TCRE they do not include observational constraints or account for sources of uncertainty not sampled by the models. The concept of a fixed cumulative CO2 budget holds not just for 2C, but for any temperature level explored with models so far , with higher temperature levels implying larger budgets.	0

12.5.5 Potentially Abrupt or Irreversible Changes 12.5.5.1 Introduction This report adopts the definition of abrupt climate change used in Synthesis and Assessment Product 3.4 of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program CCSP . We define abrupt climate change as a large-scale change in the climate system that takes place over a few decades or less, persists  for at least a few decades, and causes substantial disruptions in human and natural systems . Other definitions of abrupt climate change exist. For example, in the AR4 climate change was defined as abrupt if it occurred faster than the typical time scale of the responsible forcing. A number of components or phenomena within the Earth system have been proposed as potentially possessing critical thresholds (some1114	0
times referred to as tipping points ), beyond which abrupt or nonlinear transitions to a different state ensues. The term irreversibility is used in various ways in the literature. The AR5 report defines a perturbed state as irreversible on a given time scale if the recovery time scale from this state due to natural processes is significantly longer than the time it takes for the system to reach this perturbed state . In that context, most aspects of the climate change resulting from CO2 emissions are irreversible, due to the long residence time of the CO2 perturbation in the atmosphere and the resulting warming . These results are discussed in Sections 12.5.2 to 12.5.4. Here, we also assess aspects of irreversibility in the context of abrupt change, multiple steady states and hysteresis, i.e., the question whether a change  would be reversible if the forcing was reversed or removed . Irreversibility of ice sheets and sea level rise are also assessed in Chapter 13.	0

12.5.5.2 The Atlantic Meridional Overturning EMICs for which the stability has been systematically assessed by suitably designed hysteresis experiments robustly show a threshold beyond which the Atlantic thermohaline circulation cannot be sustained . This is also the case for one low-resolution ESM . However, proximity to this threshold is highly model dependent and influenced by factors that are currently poorly understood. There is some indication that the CMIP3 climate models may generally overestimate the stability of the Atlantic Ocean circulation . In particular, De Vries and Weber , Dijkstra , Weber et al. , Huisman et al. , Drijfhout et al.  and Hawkins et al.  suggest that the sign of net freshwater flux into the Atlantic transported through its southern boundary via the overturning circulation determines whether or not the AMOC is in a mono-stable or bi-stable state. For the pre-industrial control climate of most of the CMIP3 models, Drijfhout et al.  found that the salt flux was negative , indicating that they were in a mono-stable regime. However, this is not the case in the CMIP5 models where Weaver et al.  found that the majority of the models were in a bi-stable regime during RCP integrations. Observations suggest that the present day ocean is in a bi-stable regime, thereby allowing for multiple equilibria and a stable `off' state of the AMOC .	0
In addition to the main threshold for a complete breakdown of the circulation, others may exist that involve more limited changes, such as a cessation of Labrador Sea deep water formation . Rapid melting of the Greenland ice sheet causes increases in freshwater runoff, potentially weakening the AMOC. None of the CMIP5 simulations include an interactive ice sheet component. However, Jungclaus et al. , Mikolajewicz et al. , Driesschaert et al.  and Hu et al.  found only a slight temporary effect of increased melt water fluxes on the AMOC, that was either small compared to the effect of enhanced poleward atmospheric moisture transport or only noticeable in the most extreme scenarios. Although many more model simulations have been conducted since the AR4 under a wide range of forcing scenarios, projections of the AMOC behaviour have not changed. Based on the available CMIP5 models, EMICs and the literature, it remains very likely that the AMOC will weaken over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial. Best estimates and ranges for the reduction from CMIP5 are 11%  in RCP2.6 and 34%  in RCP8.5  . But there is low confidence in the magnitude of the weakening. Drijfhout et al.  show that the AMOC decrease per degree global mean temperature rise varies from 1.5 to 1.9 Sv  for the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble members they considered depending on the scenario, but that the standard deviation in this regression is almost half the signal. The FIO-ESM model shows cooling over much of the NH that may be related to a strong reduction of the AMOC in all RCP scenarios , but the limited output available from the model precludes an assessment of the response and realism of this response. Hence it is not included the overall assessment of the likelihood of abrupt changes.	0
It is unlikely that the AMOC will collapse beyond the end of the 21st century for the scenarios considered but a collapse beyond the 21st century for large sustained warming cannot be excluded.There is low confidence in assessing the evolution of the AMOC beyond the 21st century. Two of the CMIP5 models revealed an eventual slowdown of the AMOC to an off state . But this did not occur abruptly. As assessed by Delworth et al. , for an abrupt transition of the AMOC to occur, the sensitivity of the AMOC to forcing would have to be far greater that seen in current models. Alternatively, significant ablation of the Greenland ice sheet greatly exceeding even the most aggressive of current projections would be required . While neither possibility can be excluded entirely, it is unlikely that the AMOC will collapse beyond the end of the 21st century because of global warming based on the models and range of scenarios considered.	0
Irreversibility of ice sheet volume and extent changes can arise because of the surface-elevation feedback that operates when a decrease of the elevation of the ice sheet induces a decreased surface mass balance , and therefore essentially applies to Greenland. As detailed in Section 13.4.3.3, several stable states of the Greenland ice sheet might exist , and the ice sheet might irreversibly shrink to a stable smaller state once a warming threshold is crossed for a certain amount of time, with the critical duration depending on how far the temperature threshold has been exceeded. Based on the available evidence , an irreversible decrease of the Greenland ice sheet due to surface mass balance changes appears very unlikely in the 21st century but likely on multi-centennial to millennial time scales in the strongest forcing scenarios. In theory  ice sheet volume and extent changes can be abrupt because of the grounding line instability that can occur in coastal regions where bedrock is retrograde  and below sea level . This essentially applies to West Antarctica, but also to parts of Greenland and East Antarctica. Furthermore, ice shelf decay induced by oceanic or atmospheric warming might lead to abruptly accelerated ice flow further inland . Because ice sheet growth is usually a slow process, such changes could also be irreversible in the definition adopted here. The available evidence  suggests that it is exceptionally unlikely that the ice sheets of either Greenland or West Antarctica will suffer a near-complete disintegration during the 21st century. More generally, the potential for abrupt and/or irreversible ice sheet changes (or the 1116	0
12.5.5.4 Permafrost Carbon Storage Since the IPCC AR4, estimates of the amount of carbon stored in permafrost have been significantly revised upwards , putting the permafrost carbon stock to an equivalent of twice the atmospheric carbon pool . Because of low carbon input at high latitudes, permafrost carbon is to a large part of Pleistocene  or Holocene  origin, and its potential vulnerability is dominated by decomposition . The conjunction of a long carbon accumulation time scale on one hand and potentially rapid permafrost thawing and carbon decomposition under warmer climatic conditions  on the other hand suggests potential irreversibility of permafrost carbon decomposition  on time scales of hundreds to thousands of years in a warming climate. Indeed, recent observations  suggest that this process, induced by widespread permafrost warming and thawing , might be already occurring. However, the existing modelling studies of permafrost carbon balance under future warming that take into account at least some of the essential permafrost-related processes  do not yield coherent results beyond the fact that present-day permafrost might become a net emitter of carbon during the 21st century under plausible future warming scenarios . This also reflects an insufficient understanding of the relevant soil processes during and after permafrost thaw, including processes leading to stabilization of unfrozen soil carbon , and precludes a firm assessment of the amplitude of irreversible changes in the climate system potentially related to permafrost degassing and associated global feedbacks at this stage .	0
12.5.5.5 Atmospheric Methane from Terrestrial and Oceanic Clathrates Model simulations  suggest that clathrate deposits in shallow regions  are susceptible to destabilization via ocean warming. However, concomitant sea level rise due to changes in ocean mass enhances clathrate stability in the ocean . A recent assessment of the potential for a future abrupt release of methane was undertaken by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program . They concluded that it was very unlikely that such a catastrophic release would occur this century. However, they argued that anthropogenic warming will very likely lead to enhanced methane emissions from both terrestrial and oceanic clathrates . Although difficult to formally assess, initial estimates of the 21st century positive feedback from methane clathrate destabilization are small but not insignificant . Nevertheless, on multi-millennial time scales, the positive feedback to anthropogenic	0
12.5.5.6 Tropical and Boreal Forests 12.5.5.6.1 Tropical forests In today's climate, the strongest growth in the Amazon rainforest occurs during the dry season when strong insolation is combined with water drawn from underground aquifers that store the previous wet season's rainfall . AOGCMs do not agree about how the dry season length in the Amazon may change in the future under the SRES A1 scenario , but simulations with coupled regional climate/potential vegetation models are consistent in simulating an increase in dry season length, a 70% reduction in the areal extent of the rainforest by the end of the 21st century using the SRES A2 scenario, and an eastward expansion of the Caatinga vegetation . In addition, some models have demonstrated the existence of multiple equilibria of the tropical South American climate-vegetation system . The transition could be abrupt when the dry season becomes too long for the vegetation to survive, although the resilience of the vegetation to a longer dry period may be increased by the CO2 fertilization effect . Deforestation may also increase dry season length  and drier conditions increase the likelihood of wildfires that, combined with fire ignition associated with human activity, can undermine the forest's resiliency to climate change . If climate change brings drier conditions closer to those supportive of seasonal forests rather than rainforest, fire can act as a trigger to abruptly and irreversibly change the ecosystem . However, the existence of refugia is an important determinant of the potential for the re-emergence of the vegetation . Analysis of projected change in the climate-biome space of current vegetation distributions suggest that the risk of Amazonian forest dieback is small , a finding supported by modelling when strong carbon dioxide fertilization effects on Amazonian vegetation are assumed . However, the strength of CO2 fertilization on tropical vegetation is poorly known . Uncertainty concerning the existence of critical thresholds in the Amazonian and other tropical rainforests purely driven by climate change therefore remains high, and so the possibility of a critical threshold being crossed in precipitation volume cannot be ruled out . Nevertheless, there is still some question as to whether a transition of the Amazonian or other tropical rainforests into a lower biomass state could result from the combined effects of limits to carbon fertilization, climate warming, potential precipitation decline in interaction with the effects of human land use. 12.5.5.6.2 Boreal forest Evidence from field observations and biogeochemical modelling make it scientifically conceivable that regions of the boreal forest could tip into a different vegetation state under climate warming, but uncertainties	0
on the likelihood of this occurring are very high . This is mainly due to large gaps in knowledge concerning relevant ecosystemic and plant physiological responses to warming . The main response is a potential advancement of the boreal forest northward and the potential transition from a forest to a woodland or grassland state on its dry southern edges in the continental interiors, leading to an overall increase in herbaceous vegetation cover in the affected parts of the boreal zone . The proposed potential mechanisms for decreased forest growth and/or increased forest mortality are: increased drought stress under warmer summer conditions in regions with low soil moisture ; desiccation of saplings with shallow roots due to summer drought periods in the top soil layers, causing suppression of forest reproduction ; leaf tissue damage due to high leaf temperatures during peak summer temperatures under strong climate warming; and increased insect, herbivory and subsequent fire damage in damaged or struggling stands . The balance of effects controlling standing biomass, fire type and frequency, permafrost thaw depth, snow volume and soil moisture remains uncertain. Although the existence of, and the thresholds controlling, a potential critical threshold in the boreal forest are extremely uncertain, its existence cannot at present be ruled out.	1
12.5.5.7 Sea Ice Several studies based on observational data or model hindcasts suggest that the rapidly declining summer Arctic sea ice cover might reach or might already have passed a tipping point . Identifying Arctic sea ice tipping points from the short observational record is difficult due to high interannual and decadal variability. In some climate projections, the decrease in summer Arctic sea ice areal coverage is not gradual but is instead punctuated by 5- to10- year periods of strong ice loss . Still, these abrupt reductions do not necessarily require the existence of a tipping point in the system or further imply an irreversible behaviour . The 5- to 10-year events discussed by Holland et al.  arise when large natural climate variability in the Arctic reinforces the anthropogenically-forced change . Positive trends on the same time scale also occur when internal variability counteracts the forced change until the middle of the 21st century . Further work using single-column energy-balance models  yielded mixed results about the possibility of tipping points and bifurcations in the transition from perennial to seasonal sea ice cover. Thin ice and snow covers promote strong longwave radiative loss to space and high ice growth rates . These stabilizing negative feedbacks can be large enough to overcome the positive surface-albedo feedback and/or cloud feedback, which act to amplify the forced sea ice response. In such low-order models, the emergence of multiple stable states with increased climate forcing is a parameter-dependent feature . For example, Eisenman  showed with a single-column energy-balance model that certain parameter choices that cause thicker ice or warmer ocean under a given climate forcing make the model more prone to bifurcations and hence irreversible behaviour. 1117	0
The reversibility of sea ice loss with respect to global or hemispheric mean surface temperature change has been directly assessed in AOGCMs/ESMs by first raising the CO2 concentration until virtually all sea ice disappears year-round and then lowering the CO2 level at the same rate as during the ramp-up phase until it reaches again the initial value . None of these studies show evidence of a bifurcation leading to irreversible changes in Arctic sea ice. AOGCMs have also been used to test summer Arctic sea ice recovery after either sudden or very rapid artificial removal, and all had sea ice return within a few years . In the Antarctic, as a result of the strong coupling between the Southern Ocean's surface and the deep ocean, the sea ice areal coverage in some of the models integrated with ramp-up and ramp-down atmospheric CO2 concentration exhibits a significant lag relative to the global or hemispheric mean surface temperature , so that its changes may be considered irreversible on centennial time scales. Diagnostic analyses of a few global climate models have shown abrupt sea ice losses in the transition from seasonal to year-round Arctic icefree conditions after raising CO2 to very high levels , but without evidence for irreversible changes. Winton  hypothesized that the small ice cap instability  could cause such an abrupt transition. With a low-order Arctic sea ice model, Eisenman and Wettlaufer  also found an abrupt change behaviour in the transition from seasonal ice to year-round ice-free conditions, accompanied by an irreversible bifurcation to a new stable, annually ice-free state. They concluded that the cause is a loss of the stabilizing effect of sea ice growth when the ice season shrinks in time. The Arctic sea ice may thus experience a sharp transition to annually ice-free conditions, but the irreversible nature of this transition seems to depend on the model complexity and structure.	0
In conclusion, rapid summer Arctic sea ice losses are likely to occur in the transition to seasonally ice-free conditions. These abrupt changes might have consequences throughout the climate system as noted by Vavrus et al.  for cloud cover and Lawrence et al.  for the high-latitude ground state. Furthermore, the interannual-to-decadal variability in the summer Arctic sea ice extent is projected to increase in response to global warming . These studies suggest that large anomalies in Arctic sea ice areal coverage, like the ones that occurred in 2007 and 2012, might become increasingly frequent. However, there is little evidence in global climate models of a tipping point  in the transition from a perennially ice-covered to a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean beyond which further sea ice loss is unstoppable and irreversible.	0
years. Because the long-term droughts all ended, they are not irreversible. Nonetheless transitions over years to a decade into a state of long-term drought would have impacts on human and natural systems. AR4 climate model projections  and CMIP5 ensembles  both suggest widespread drying and drought across most of southwestern North America and many other subtropical regions by the mid to late 21st century , although without abrupt change. Some studies suggest that this subtropical drying may have already begun in southwestern North America . More recent studies  suggest that regional reductions in precipitation are due primarily to internal variability and that the anthropogenic forced trends are currently weak in comparison. While previous long-term droughts in southwest North America arose from natural causes, climate models project that this region will undergo progressive aridification as part of a general drying and poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zones driven by rising GHGs . The models project the aridification to intensify steadily as RF and global warming progress without abrupt changes. Because of the very long lifetime of the anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 perturbation, such drying induced by global warming would be largely irreversible on millennium time scale  . For example, Solomon et al.  found in a simulation where atmospheric CO2 increases to 600 ppm followed by zero emissions, that the 15% reduction in precipitation in areas such as southwest North America, southern Europe and western Australia would persist long after emissions ceased. This, however, is largely a consequence of the warming persisting for centuries after emissions cease rather than an irreversible behaviour of the water cycle itself. 12.5.5.8.2 Monsoonal circulation Climate model simulations and paleo-reconstructions provide evidence of past abrupt changes in Saharan vegetation, with the `green Sahara' conditions  of the African Humid Period  during the mid-Holocene serving as the most recent example. However, Mitchell  and Claussen et al.  note that the mid-Holocene is not a direct analogue for future GHG-induced climate change since the forcings are different: a increased shortwave forcing in the NH summer versus a globally and seasonally uniform atmospheric CO2 increase, respectively. Paleoclimate examples suggest that a strong radiative or SST forcing is needed to achieve a rapid climate change, and that the rapid changes are reversible when the forcing is withdrawn. Both the abrupt onset and termination of the AHP were triggered when northern African summer insolation was 4.2% higher than present day, representing a local increase of about 19 W m-2 . Note that the globally averaged radiative anthropogenic forcing from 1750 to 2011  is small compared to this local increase in insolation. A rapid Saharan greening has been simulated in a climate model of intermediate complexity forced by a rapid increase in atmospheric CO2, with the overall extent of greening depending on the equilibrium atmospheric CO2 level reached .	0
Abrupt Saharan vegetation changes of the Younger Dryas are linked with a rapid AMOC weakening which is considered very unlikely during the 21st century and unlikely beyond that as a consequence of global warming. Studies with conceptual models  have shown that the Indian summer monsoon can operate in two stable regimes: besides the `wet' summer monsoon, a stable state exists which is characterized by low precipitation over India. These studies suggest that any perturbation of the radiative budget that tends to weaken the driving pressure gradient has the potential to induce abrupt transitions between these two regimes. Numerous studies with coupled ocean-atmosphere models have explored the potential impact of anthropogenic forcing on the Indian monsoon . When forced with anticipated increases in GHG concentrations, the majority of these studies show an intensification of the rainfall associated with the Indian summer monsoon . Despite the intensification of precipitation, several of these modelling studies show a weakening of the summer monsoon circulation . The net effect is nevertheless an increase of precipitation due to enhanced moisture transport into the Asian monsoon region . In recent years, studies with GCMs have also explored the direct effect of aerosol forcing on the Indian monsoon . Considering absorbing aerosols  only, Meehl et al.  found an increase in pre-monsoonal precipitation, but a decrease in summer monsoon precipitation over parts of South Asia. In contrast, Lau et al.  found an increase in May-June-July precipitation in that region. If an increase in scattering aerosols only is considered, the monsoon circulation weakens and precipitation is inhibited . More recently, Bollasina et al.  showed that anthropogenic aerosols played a fundamental role in driving the recent observed weakening of the summer monsoon. Given that the effect of increased atmospheric regional loading of aerosols is opposed by the concomitant increases in GHG concentrations, it is unlikely that an abrupt transition to the dry summer monsoon regime will be triggered in the 21st century.	0
Past Sea Level Change Paleo sea level records from warm periods during the last 3 million years indicate that global mean sea level has exceeded 5 m above present 1 when global mean temperature was up to 2C warmer than pre-industrial . There is very high confidence that maximum global mean sea level during the last interglacial period  was, for several thousand years, at least 5 m higher than present and high confidence that it did not exceed 10 m above present, implying substantial contributions from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. This change in sea level occurred in the context of different orbital forcing and with high latitude surface temperature, averaged over several thousand years, at least 2C warmer than present  	0
Global Mean Sea Level Rise Projections It is very likely that the rate of global mean sea level rise during the 21st century will exceed the rate observed during 1971- 2010 for all Representative Concentration Pathway  scenarios due to increases in ocean warming and loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets. Projections of sea level rise are larger than in the AR4, primarily because of improved modeling of land-ice contributions. For the period 2081-2100, compared to 1986-2005, global mean sea level rise is likely  to be in the 5 to 95% range of projections from processbased models, which give 0.26 to 0.55 m for RCP2.6, 0.32 to 0.63 m for RCP4.5, 0.33 to 0.63 m for RCP6.0, and 0.45 to 0.82 m for RCP8.5. For RCP8.5, the rise by 2100 is 0.52 to 0.98 m with a rate during 2081-2100 of 8 to 16 mm yr-1. We have considered the evidence for higher projections and have concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to evaluate the probability of specific levels above the assessed likely range. Based on current understanding, only the collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause global mean sea level to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. This potential additional contribution cannot be precisely quantified but there is medium confidence that it would not exceed several tenths of a meter of sea level rise during the 21st century. 	0
It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue beyond 2100, with sea level rise due to thermal expansion to continue for many centuries. The amount of longer term sea level rise depends on future emissions. The few available process-based models that go beyond 2100 indicate global mean sea level rise above the pre-industrial level to be less than 1 m by 2300 for greenhouse gas concentrations that peak and decline and remain below 500 ppm CO2-eq, as in scenario RCP2.6. For a radiative forcing that corresponds to above 700 ppm CO2-eq but below 1500 ppm, as in the scenario RCP8.5, the projected rise is 1 m to more than 3 m 1140	0
Regional Sea Level Change Projections It is very likely that in the 21st century and beyond, sea level change will have a strong regional pattern, with some places experiencing significant deviations of local and regional sea level change from the global mean change. Over decadal periods, the rates of regional sea level change as a result of climate variability can differ from the global average rate by more than 100% of the global average rate. By the end of the 21st century, it is very likely that over about 95% of the world ocean, regional sea level rise will be positive, and most regions that will experience a sea level fall are located near current and former glaciers and ice sheets. About 70% of the global coastlines are projected to experience a relative sea level change within 20% of the global mean sea level change. 	0
Projections of 21st Century Sea Level Extremes and Surface Waves It is very likely that there will be a significant increase in the occurrence of future sea level extremes in some regions by 2100, with a likely increase in the early 21st century. This increase will primarily be the result of an increase in mean sea level , with the frequency of a particular sea level extreme increasing by an order of magnitude or more in some regions by the end of the 21st century. There is low confidence in region-specific projections of storminess and associated storm surges. 	0
It is likely  that annual mean significant wave heights will increase in the Southern Ocean as a result of enhanced wind speeds. Southern Ocean generated swells are likely to affect heights, periods, and directions of waves in adjacent basins. It is very likely that wave heights and the duration of the wave season will increase in the Arctic Ocean as a result of reduced sea-ice extent. In general, there is low confidence in region-specific projections due to the low confidence in tropical and extratropical storm projections, and to the challenge of downscaling future wind fields from coarse-resolution climate models. 	0
13.1.1 Introduction and Chapter Overview Changes in sea level occur over a broad range of temporal and spatial scales, with the many contributing factors making it an integral measure of climate change . The primary contributors to contemporary sea level change are the expansion of the ocean as it warms and the transfer of water currently stored on land to the ocean, particularly from land ice  . Observations indicate the largest increase in the storage of heat in the climate system over recent decades has been in the oceans  and thus sea level rise from ocean warming is a central part of the Earth's response to increasing greenhouse gas  concentrations. The First IPCC Assessment Report  laid the groundwork for much of our current understanding of sea level change . This included the recognition that sea level had risen during the 20th century, that the rate of rise had increased compared to the 19th century, that ocean thermal expansion and the mass loss from glaciers were the main contributors to the 20th century rise, that during the 21st century the rate of rise was projected to be faster than during the 20th century, that sea level will not rise uniformly around the world, and that sea level would continue to rise well after GHG emissions are reduced. They also concluded that no major dynamic response of the ice sheets was expected during the 21st century, leaving ocean thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers as the main contributors to the 21st century rise. The Second Assessment Report  came to very similar conclusions .	0
By the time of the Third Assessment Report , coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models  and ice-sheet models largely replaced energy balance climate models as the primary techniques supporting the interpretation of observations and the projections of sea level . This approach allowed consideration of the regional distribution of sea level change in addition to the global average change. By the time of the Fourth Assessment Report , there were more robust observations of the variations in the rate of global average sea level rise for the 20th century, some understanding of the variability in the rate of rise, and the satellite altimeter record was long enough to reveal the complexity of the time-variable spatial distribution of sea level . Nevertheless, three central issues remained. First, the observed sea level rise over decades was larger than the sum of the individual contributions estimated from observations or with models , although in general the uncertainties were large enough that there was no significant contradiction. Second, it was not possible to make confident projections of the regional distribution of sea level rise. Third, there was insufficient understanding of the potential contributions from the ice sheets. In particular, the AR4 recognized that existing ice-sheet models were unable to simulate the recent observations of ice-sheet accelerations and that understanding of ice-sheet dynamics was too limited to assess the likelihood of continued acceleration or to provide a best estimate or an upper bound for their future contributions.	0
Despite changes in the scenarios between the four Assessments, the sea level projections for 2100  for the full range of scenarios were remarkably similar, with the reduction in the upper end in more recent reports reflecting the smaller increase in radiative forcing  in recent scenarios due to smaller GHG emissions and the inclusion of aerosols, and a reduction in uncertainty in projecting the contributions: 31 to 110 cm in the FAR, 13 to 94 cm in the SAR, 9 to 88 cm in the TAR and 18 to 59 cm in AR4 . Results since the AR4 show that for recent decades, sea level has continued to rise . Improved and new observations of the ocean  and the cryosphere  and their representation in models have resulted in better understanding of 20th century sea level rise and its components . Records of past sea level changes constrain long-term land-ice response to warmer climates as well as extend the observational record to provide a longer context for current sea level rise . This chapter provides a synthesis of past and contemporary sea level change at global and regional scales. Drawing on the published refereed literature, including as summarized in earlier chapters of this Assessment, we explain the reasons for contemporary change and assess confidence in and provide global and regional projections of likely sea level change for the 21st century and beyond. We discuss the primary factors that cause regional sea level to differ from the global average and how these may change in the future. In addition, we address projected changes in surface waves and the consequences of sea level and climate change for extreme sea level events.	0
The height of the ocean surface at any given location, or sea level, is measured either with respect to the surface of the solid Earth ) or a geocentric reference such as the reference ellipsoid . RSL is the more relevant quantity when considering the coastal impacts of sea level change, and it has been measured using tide gauges during the past few centuries  and estimated for longer time spans from geological records . Geocentric sea level has been measured over the past two decades using satellite altimetry . A temporal average for a given location, known as Mean Sea Level , is applied to remove shorter period variability. Apart from Section 13.7, which considers high-frequency changes in ocean surface height, the use of `sea level' elsewhere in this chapter refers to MSL. It is common to average MSL spatially to define global mean sea level . In principle, integrating RSL change over the ocean area gives the change in ocean water volume, which is directly related to the processes that dominate sea level change . In contrast, a small correction  needs to be subtracted from altimetry observations to estimate ocean water volume change . Local RSL change can differ significantly from GMSL because of spatial variability in changes of the sea surface and ocean floor height .	0
This chapter focusses on processes within the ocean, atmosphere, land ice, and hydrological cycle that are climate sensitive and are expected to contribute to sea level change at regional to global scales in the coming decades to centuries . Figure 13.2 is a navigation aid for the different sections of this chapter and sections of other chapters that are relevant to sea level change. Changes in ocean currents, ocean density and sea level are all tightly coupled such that changes at one location impact local sea level and sea level far from the location of the initial change, including changes in sea level at the coast in response to changes in open-ocean temperature . Although both temperature and salinity changes can contribute significantly to regional sea level change , only temperature change produces a significant contribution to global average ocean volume change due to thermal expansion or contraction . Regional atmospheric pressure anomalies also cause sea level to vary through atmospheric loading . All of these climate-sensitive processes cause sea level to vary on a broad range of space and time scales from relatively short-lived events, such as waves and storm surges, to sustained changes over several decades or centuries that are associated with atmospheric and ocean modes of climate variability . Water and ice mass exchange between the land and the oceans leads to a change in GMSL. A signal of added mass to the ocean propagates rapidly around the globe such that all regions experience a sea level change within days of the mass being added . In addition, an influx of freshwater changes ocean temperature and salinity and thus changes ocean currents and local sea level , with signals taking decades to propagate around	0
the global ocean. The coupled atmosphere-ocean system can also adjust to temperature anomalies associated with surface freshwater anomalies through air-sea feedbacks, resulting in dynamical adjustments of sea level . Water mass exchange between land and the ocean also results in patterns of sea level change called `sea level fingerprints'  due to change in the gravity field and vertical movement of the ocean floor associated with visco-elastic Earth deformation . These changes in mass distribution also affect the Earth's inertia tensor and therefore rotation, which produces an additional sea level response . There are other processes that affect sea level but are not associated with contemporary climate change. Some of these result in changes that are large enough to influence the interpretation of observational records and sea level projections at regional and global scales. In particular, surface mass transfer from land ice to oceans during the last deglaciation contributes significantly to present-day sea level change due to the ongoing visco-elastic deformation of the Earth and the corresponding changes of the ocean floor height and gravity ) . Ice sheets also have long response times and so continue to respond to past climate change . Anthropogenic processes that influence the amount of water stored in the ground or on its surface in lakes and reservoirs, or cause changes in land surface characteristics that influence runoff or evapotranspiration rates, will perturb the hydrological cycle and cause sea level change . Such processes include water impoundment , irrigation schemes, and groundwater depletion .	0
Figure 13.2 | Schematic representation of key linkages between processes and components that contribute to sea level change and are considered in this report. Colouring of individual boxes indicates the types of models and approaches used in projecting the contribution of each process or component to future sea level change. The diagram also serves as an index to the sections in this Assessment that are relevant to the assessment of sea level projections via the section numbers given at the bottom of each box. Note gravity and solid Earth effects change the shape of the ocean floor and surface and thus are required to infer changes in ocean water volume from both relative and geocentric sea level observations.	0
Sea level changes due to tectonic and coastal processes are beyond the scope of this chapter. With the exception of earthquakes, which can cause rapid local changes and tsunamis  and secular RSL changes due to post-seismic deformation , tectonic processes cause, on average, relatively low rates of sea level change . Sediment transfer and compaction  in the coastal zone are particularly important in deltaic regions . Although they can dominate sea level change in these localized areas, they are less important as a source of sea level change at regional and global scales and so are not considered further in this chapter . Estimates of sediment delivery to the oceans  suggest a contribution to GMSL rise of order 0.01 mm yr-1. 1144	0
AOGCMs have components representing the ocean, atmosphere, land, and cryosphere, and simulate sea surface height changes relative to the geoid resulting from the natural forcings of volcanic eruptions and changes in solar irradiance, and from anthropogenic increases in GHGs and aerosols . AOGCMs also exhibit internally generated climate variability, including such modes as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation , the Pacific Decadal Oscillation , the North Atlantic Oscillation  and others that affect sea level . Critical components for global and regional changes in sea level are changes in surface wind stress and air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes  and the resultant changes in ocean density and circulation, for instance in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation  . As in the real world, ocean density, circulation and sea level are dynamically connected in AOGCMs and evolve together. Offline models are required for simulating glacier and ice-sheet changes . Geodynamic surface-loading models are used to simulate the RSL response to past and contemporary changes in surface water and landice mass redistribution and contemporary atmospheric pressure changes. The sea surface height component of the calculation is based solely on water mass conservation and perturbations to gravity, with no considerations of ocean dynamic effects. Application of these models has focussed on annual and interannual variability driven by contemporary changes in the hydrological cycle and atmospheric loading , and on secular trends associated with past and contemporary changes in land ice and hydrology . Semi-empirical models  project sea level based on statistical relationships between observed GMSL and global mean temperature  or total RF . The form of this relationship is motivated by physical considerations, and the parameters are determined from observational data--hence the term `semi-empirical' . SEMs do not explicitly simulate the underlying processes, and they use a characteristic response time that could be considerably longer than the time scale of interest  or one that is explicitly determined by the model . Storm-surge and wave-projection models are used to assess how changes in storminess and MSL impact sea level extremes and wave climates. The two main approaches involve dynamical  and statistical models . The dynamical models are forced by near-surface wind and mean sea level pressure fields derived from regional or global climate models . In this chapter, we use the term `process-based models'  to refer to sea level and land-ice models  that aim to simulate the underlying processes and interactions, in contrast to	0
13.1.4.1 Models Used to Project Changes in Ice Sheets and Glaciers The representation of glaciers and ice sheets within AOGCMs is not yet at a stage where projections of their changing mass are routinely available. Additional process-based models use output from AOGCMs to evaluate the consequences of projected climate change on these ice masses. The overall contribution of an ice mass to sea level involves changes to either its surface mass balance  or changes in the dynamics of ice flow that affect outflow  to the ocean. SMB is primarily the difference between snow accumulation and the melt and sublimation of snow and ice . An assessment of observations related to this mass budget can be found in Section 4.4.2. Although some ice-sheet models used in projections incorporate both effects, most studies have focussed on either SMB or flow dynamics. It is assumed that the overall contribution can be found by summing the contributions calculated independently for these two sources, which is valid if they do not interact significantly. Although this can be addressed using a correction term to SMB in ice-sheet projections over the next century, such interactions become more important on longer time scales when, for example, changes in ice-sheet topography may significantly affect SMB or dynamics. Projecting the sea level contribution of land ice requires comparing the model results with a base state that assumes no significant sea level contribution. This base state is taken to be either the pre-industrial period or, because of our scant knowledge of the ice sheets before the advent of satellites, the late 20th century. In reality, even at these times, the ice sheets may have been contributing to sea level change  and this contribution, although difficult to quantify, should be included in the observed sea level budget . Regional Climate Models , which incorporate or are coupled to sophisticated representations of the mass and energy budgets associated with snow and ice surfaces, are now the primary source of ice-sheet SMB projections. A major source of uncertainty lies in the ability of these schemes to adequately represent the process of internal refreezing of melt water within the snowpack . These models require information on the state of the atmosphere and ocean at their lateral boundaries, which are derived from reanalysis data sets or AOGCMs for past climate, or from AOGCM projections of future climate. Models of ice dynamics require a fairly complete representation of stresses within an ice mass in order to represent the response of ice flow to changes at the marine boundary and the governing longitudinal stresses . For Antarctica, there is also a need to employ high spatial resolution  to capture the dynamics of grounding	0
line migration robustly so that results do not depend to an unreasonable extent on model resolution . One-dimensional flowline models have been developed to the stage that modelled iceberg calving is comparable with observations . The success of this modelling approach relies on the ability of the model's computational grid to evolve to continuously track the migrating calving front. Although this is relatively straightforward in a one-dimensional model, this technique is difficult to incorporate into three-dimensional ice-sheet models that typically use a computational grid that is fixed in space. The main challenge faced by models attempting to assess sea level change from glaciers is the small number of glaciers for which mass budget observations are available    as compared to the total number  . Statistical techniques are used to derive relations between observed SMB and climate variables for the small sample of surveyed glaciers, and then these relations are used to upscale to regions of the world. These techniques often include volume-area scaling to estimate glacier volume from their more readily observable areas. Although tidewater glaciers may also be affected by changes in outflow related to calving, the complexity of the associated processes means that most studies limit themselves to assessing the effects of SMB changes.	0
Records of past sea level change provide insight into the sensitivity of sea level to past climate change as well as context for understanding current changes and evaluating projected changes. Since the AR4, important progress has been made in understanding the amplitude and variability of sea level during past intervals when climate was warmer than pre-industrial, largely through better accounting of the effects of proxy uncertainties and GIA on coastal sequences  . Here we summarize the constraints provided by the record of past sea level variations during times when global temperature was similar to or warmer than today.	0
13.2.1.1 The Middle Pliocene There is medium confidence that during the warm intervals of the middle Pliocene , global mean surface temperatures were 2C to 3.5C warmer than for pre-industrial climate . There are multiple lines of evidence that GMSL during these middle Pliocene warm periods was higher than today, but low agreement on how high it reached . The most robust lines of evidence come from proximal sedimentary records that suggest periodic deglaciation of the West Antarctic ice sheet  and parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet   and from ice-sheet models that suggest near-complete deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet, WAIS and partial deglaciation of the EAIS 1145	0
13.2.1.2 Marine Isotope Stage 11 During marine isotope stage 11 , Antarctic ice core and tropical Pacific paleo temperature estimates suggest that global temperature was 1.5C to 2.0C warmer than pre-industrial  . Studies of the magnitude of sea level highstands from raised shorelines attributed to MIS 11 have generated highly divergent estimates. Since the AR4, studies have accounted for GIA effects  or reported elevations from sites where the GIA effects are estimated to be small . From this evidence, our assessment is that MIS 11 GMSL reached 6 to 15 m higher than present , requiring a loss of most or all of the present Greenland ice sheet and WAIS plus a reduction in the EAIS of up to 5 m equivalent sea level if sea level rise was at the higher end of the range.	0
New data syntheses and model simulations since the AR4 indicate that during the Last Interglacial Period , global mean annual temperature was 1C to 2oC warmer than pre-industrial  with peak global annual sea surface temperatures  that were 0.7C  0.6C warmer  . High latitude surface temperature, averaged over several thousand years, was at least 2C warmer than present  . There is robust evidence and high agreement that under the different orbital forcing and warmer climate of the LIG, sea level was higher than present. There have been a large number of estimates of the magnitude of LIG GMSL rise from localities around the globe, but they are generally from a small number of RSL reconstructions, and do not consider GIA effects, which can be substantial . Since the AR4, two approaches have addressed GIA effects in order to infer LIG sea level from RSL observations at coastal sites. Kopp et al.  obtained a probabilistic estimate of GMSL based on a large and geographically broadly distributed database of LIG sea level indicators. Their analysis accounted for GIA effects  as well as uncertainties in geochronology, the interpretation of sea level indicators, and regional tectonic uplift and subsidence. Kopp et al.  concluded that GMSL was 6.4 m  and 7.7 m  higher than present, and with a 33% probability that it exceeded 8.8 m. The other approach, taken by Dutton and Lambeck , used data from far-field sites that are tectonically stable. Their estimate of 5.5 to 9 m LIG GMSL is consistent with the probabilistic estimates made by Kopp et al. . Chapter 5 thus concluded there is very high confidence that the maximum GMSL during the LIG was at least 5 m higher than present and high confidence it did not exceed 10 m. The best estimate is 6 m higher than present. Chapter 5 also concluded from ice-sheet model simulations and elevation changes derived from a new Greenland ice core that the Greenland ice sheet very likely contributed between 1.4 and 4.3 m sea level equivalent. This implies with medium confidence a 1146	0
contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet to the global mean sea level during the last interglacial period, but this is not yet supported by observational and model evidence. There is medium confidence for a sea level fluctuation of up to 4 m during the LIG, but regional sea level variability and uncertainties in sea level proxies and their ages cause differences in the timing and amplitude of the reported fluctuation . For the time interval during the LIG in which GMSL was above present, there is high confidence that the maximum 1000year average rate of GMSL rise associated with the sea level fluctuation exceeded 2 m kyr-1 but that it did not exceed 7 m kyr-1  . Faster rates lasting less than a millennium cannot be ruled out by these data. Therefore, there is high confidence that there were intervals when rates of GMSL rise during the LIG exceeded the 20th century rate of 1.7  mm yr-1.	0
13.2.1.4 The Late Holocene Since the AR4, there has been significant progress in resolving the sea level history of the last 7000 years. RSL records indicate that from ~7 to 3 ka, GMSL likely rose 2 to 3 m to near present-day levels . Based on local sea level records spanning the last 2000 years, there is medium confidence that fluctuations in GMSL during this interval have not exceeded ~ 0.25 m on time scales of a few hundred years . The most robust signal captured in salt marsh records from both Northern and Southern Hemispheres supports the AR4 conclusion for a transition from relatively low rates of change during the late Holocene  to modern rates  . However, there is variability in the magnitude and the timing  of this increase in both paleo and instrumental  records . By combining paleo sea level records with tide gauge records at the same localities, Gehrels and Woodworth  concluded that sea level began to rise above the late Holocene background rate between 1905 and 1945, consistent with the conclusions by Lambeck et al. .	0

FAQ 13.1 | Why Does Local Sea Level Change Differ from the Global Average? Shifting surface winds, the expansion of warming ocean water, and the addition of melting ice can alter ocean currents which, in turn, lead to changes in sea level that vary from place to place. Past and present variations in the distribution of land ice affect the shape and gravitational field of the Earth, which also cause regional fluctuations in sea level. Additional variations in sea level are caused by the influence of more localized processes such as sediment compaction and tectonics. Along any coast, vertical motion of either the sea or land surface can cause changes in sea level relative to the land . For example, a local change can be caused by an increase in sea surface height, or by a decrease in land height. Over relatively short time spans , the influence of tides, storms and climatic variability--such as El Nino--dominates sea level variations. Earthquakes and landslides can also have an effect by causing changes in land height and, sometimes, tsunamis. Over longer time spans , the influence of climate change--with consequent changes in volume of ocean water and land ice--is the main contributor to sea level change in most regions. Over these longer time scales, various processes may also cause vertical motion of the land surface, which can also result in substantial changes in relative sea level. Since the late 20th century, satellite measurements of the height of the ocean surface relative to the center of the Earth  show differing rates of geocentric sea level change around the world . For example, in the western Pacific Ocean, rates were about three times greater than the global mean value of about 3 mm per year from 1993 to 2012. In contrast, those in the eastern Pacific Ocean are lower than the global mean value, with much of the west coast of the Americas experiencing a fall in sea surface height over the same period. 	0
FAQ13.1, Figure 1 | Map of rates of change in sea surface height  for the period 1993-2012 from satellite altimetry. Also shown are relative sea level changes  from selected tide gauge stations for the period 1950-2012. For comparison, an estimate of global mean sea level change is also shown  with each tide gauge time series. The relatively large, short-term oscillations in local sea level  are due to the natural climate variability described in the main text. For example, the large, regular deviations at Pago Pago are associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.	0
Much of the spatial variation shown in FAQ 13.1, Figure 1 is a result of natural climate variability--such as El Nino and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation--over time scales from about a year to several decades. These climate variations alter surface winds, ocean currents, temperature and salinity, and hence affect sea level. The influence of these processes will continue during the 21st century, and will be superimposed on the spatial pattern of sea level change associated with longer term climate change, which also arises through changes in surface winds, ocean currents, temperature and salinity, as well as ocean volume. However, in contrast to the natural variability, the longer term trends accumulate over time and so are expected to dominate over the 21st century. The resulting rates of geocentric sea level change over this longer period may therefore exhibit a very different pattern from that shown in FAQ 13.1, Figure 1. Tide gauges measure relative sea level, and so they include changes resulting from vertical motion of both the land and the sea surface. Over many coastal regions, vertical land motion is small, and so the long-term rate of sea level change recorded by coastal and island tide gauges is similar to the global mean value . In some regions, vertical land motion has had an important influence. For example, the steady fall in sea level recorded at Stockholm  is caused by uplift of this region after the melting of a large  continental ice sheet at the end of the last Ice Age, between ~20,000 and ~9000 years ago. Such ongoing land deformation as a response to the melting of ancient ice sheets is a significant contributor to regional sea level changes in North America and northwest Eurasia, which were covered by large continental ice sheets during the peak of the last Ice Age. In other regions, this process can also lead to land subsidence, which elevates relative sea levels, as it has at Charlottetown, where a relatively large increase has been observed, compared to the global mean rate . Vertical land motion due to movement of the Earth's tectonic plates can also cause departures from the global mean sea level trend in some areas--most significantly, those located near active subduction zones, where one tectonic plate slips beneath another. For the case of Antofagasta  this appears to result in steady land uplift and therefore relative sea level fall. In addition to regional influences of vertical land motion on relative sea level change, some processes lead to land motion that is rapid but highly localized. For example, the greater rate of rise relative to the global mean at Manila  is dominated by land subsidence caused by intensive groundwater pumping. Land subsidence due to natural and anthropogenic processes, such as the extraction of groundwater or hydrocarbons, is common in many coastal regions, particularly in large river deltas. -3.0 -2.0 -1.0 0.0	0
It is commonly assumed that melting ice from glaciers Sea level change  or the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets would cause FAQ13.1, Figure 2 | Model output showing relative sea level change due to globally uniform sea level rise, much like filling a bath melting of the Greenland ice sheet and the West Antarctic ice sheet at rates of tub with water. In fact, such melting results in region0.5 mm yr-1 each . The modelled sea level changes are less than the global mean value in areas al variations in sea level due to a variety of processes, near the melting ice but enhanced further afield.  gravity field and land height. For example, computer models that simulate these latter two processes predict a regional fall in relative sea level around the melting ice sheets, because the gravitational attraction between ice and ocean water is reduced, and the land tends to rise as the ice melts . However, further away from the ice sheet melting, sea level rise is enhanced, compared to the global average value. -1	0
In summary, a variety of processes drive height changes of the ocean surface and ocean floor, resulting in distinct spatial patterns of sea level change at local to regional scales. The combination of these processes produces a complex pattern of total sea level change, which varies through time as the relative contribution of each process changes. The global average change is a useful single value that reflects the contribution of climatic processes , and represents a good estimate of sea level change at many coastal locations. At the same time, however, where the various regional processes result in a strong signal, there can be large departures from the global average value. 1149	0
that the long-term trend estimate in GMSL is 1.7  mm yr-1 between 1901 and 2010 for a total sea level rise of 0.19  m . Interannual and decadal-scale variability is superimposed on the long-term MSL trend, and Chapter 3 noted that discrepancies between the various published MSL records are present at these shorter time scales. Section 3.7 also concludes that it is likely that the rate of sea level rise increased from the 19th century to the 20th century. Taking this evidence in conjunction with the proxy evidence for a change of rate , there is high confidence that the rate of sea level rise has increased during the last two centuries, and it is likely that GMSL has accelerated since the early 1900's. Because of the presence of low-frequency variations ), sea level acceleration results are sensitive to the choice of the analysis time span. When a 60-year oscillation is modelled along with an acceleration term, the estimated acceleration in GMSL  computed over 1900-2010 ranges from 0.000  mm yr-2 in the Ray and Douglas  record, to 0.013  mm yr-2 in the Jevrejeva et al.  record, and 0.012  mm yr-2 in the Church and White  record. For comparison, Church and White  estimated the acceleration term to be 0.009  mm yr-2 over the 1880-2009 time span when the 60-year cycle is not considered.	0
The high-precision satellite altimetry record started in 1992 and provides nearly global  sea level measurements at 10-day intervals. Ollivier et al.  showed that Envisat, which observes to 82 latitude, provides comparable GMSL estimates. Although there are slight differences at interannual time scales in the altimetry-based GMSL time series produced by different groups , there is very good agreement on the 20-year long GMSL trend . After accounting for the ~ -0.3 mm yr-1 correction related to the increasing size of the global ocean basins due to GIA , a GMSL rate of 3.2  mm yr-1 over 1993-2012 is found by the different altimetry data processing groups. The current level of precision is derived from assessments of all source of errors affecting the altimetric measurements  and from tide gauge comparisons . Chapter 3 concludes that the GMSL trend since 1993 is very likely higher compared to the mean rates over the 20th century, and that it is likely that GMSL rose between 1920 and 1950 at a rate comparable to that observed since 1993. This recent higher rate is also seen in tide gauge data over the same period, but on the basis of observations alone it does not necessarily reflect a recent acceleration, considering the previously reported multi-decadal variations of mean sea level. The rapid increase in GMSL since 2011 is related to the recovery from the 2011 La Nina event  .	0
13.3.1.1 Observed Important progress has been realized since AR4 in quantifying the observed thermal expansion component of global mean sea level rise. This progress reflects  the detection of systematic time-dependent depth biases affecting historical expendable bathythermograph data  ,  the newly available Argo Project ocean  data with almost global coverage  of the oceans down to 2000 m since 2004-2005, and  estimates of the deep-ocean contribution using ship-based data collected during the World Ocean Circulation Experiment and revisit cruises . For the period 1971-2010, the rate for the 0 to 700 m depth range is 0.6  mm yr-1 . Including the deep-ocean contribution for the same period increases the value to 0.8  mm yr-1 . Over the altimetry period , the rate for the 0 to 700 m depth range is 0.8  mm yr-1 and 1.1  mm yr-1 when accounting for the deep ocean .	0
13.3.1.2 Modelled GMSL rise due to thermal expansion is approximately proportional to the increase in ocean heat content . Historical GMSL rise due to thermal expansion simulated by CMIP5 models is shown in Table 13.1 and Figure 13.4a. The model spread is due to uncertainty in RF and modelled climate response . In the time mean of several decades, there is a negative volcanic forcing if there is more volcanic activity than is typical of the long term, and a positive forcing if there is less. In the decades after major volcanic eruptions, the rate of expansion is temporarily enhanced, as the ocean recovers from the cooling caused by the volcanic forcing  . During 1961-1999, a period when there were several large volcanic eruptions, the CMIP3 simulations with both natural and anthropogenic forcing have substantially smaller increasing trends in the upper 700 m than those with anthropogenic forcing only  because the natural volcanic forcing tends to cool the climate system, thus reducing ocean	0
13.3.2 Gregory  and Gregory et al.  proposed that AOGCMs underestimate ocean heat uptake in their historical simulations because their control experiments usually omit volcanic forcing, so the imposition of historical volcanic forcing on the simulated climate system represents a time mean negative forcing relative to the control climate. The apparent long persistence of the simulated oceanic cooling following the 1883 eruption of Krakatau  is a consequence of this bias, which also causes a model-dependent underestimate of up to 0.2 mm yr-1 of thermal expansion on average during the 20th century . This implies that CMIP5 results may be similarly underestimated, depending on the details of the individual model control runs. Church et al.  proposed a correction of 0.1 mm yr-1 to the model mean rate, which we apply in the sea level budget in Table 13.1 and Figure 13.7. The corrected CMIP5 model mean rate for 1971-2010 is close to the central observational estimate; the model mean rate for 1993-2010 exceeds the central observational estimate but they are not statistically different given the uncertainties . This correction is not made to projections of thermal expansion because it is very small compared with the projected increase in the rate . In view of the improvement in observational estimates of thermal expansion, the good agreement of historical model results with observational estimates, and their consistency with understanding of the	0
13.3.2.1 Observed `Glaciers' are defined here as all land-ice masses, including those peripheral to  the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The term `glaciers and ice caps' was applied to this category in the AR4. Changes in aggregate glacier volume have conventionally been determined by various methods of repeat mapping of surface elevation to detect elevation  change. Mass changes are determined by compilation and upscaling of limited direct observations of surface mass balance . Since 2003, gravity observations from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment  satellites have been used to detect mass change of the world's glaciers. The combined records indicate that a net decline of global glacier volume began in the 19th century, before significant anthropogenic RF had started, and was probably the result of warming associated with the termination of the Little Ice Age . Global rates of glacier volume loss did not increase significantly during much of the 20th century . In part this may have been because of an enhanced rate of loss due to unforced high-latitude variability early in the century, while anthropogenic warming was still comparatively small . It is likely that anthropogenic forcing played a statistically significant role in acceleration of global glacier losses in the latter decades of the 20th 1151	0

century relative to rates in the 19th century . It is also likely that, during the 20th century, the progressive loss of glacier area significantly restricted the rate of mass loss . The earliest sea level assessments recognized that glaciers have been significant contributors to GMSL rise . As assessed in Chapter 4, observations, improved methods of analysis and a new, globally complete inventory indicate that glaciers, including those around the ice-sheet peripheries, very likely continue to be significant contributors to sea level, but are also highly variable on annual to decadal time scales. It is assumed that all glacier losses contribute to sea level rise, but the potential role of terrestrial interception of runoff, either in lakes formed following future ice retreat or in groundwater, has yet to be evaluated. For the period 2003-2009, the sea level contribution of all glaciers globally, including those glaciers surrounding the periphery of the two ice sheets, is 0.71  mm yr-1 sea level equivalent  . Depending on the method used, however, loss-rate measurements of the two ice sheets can be very difficult to separate from losses from the peripheral glaciers. To avoid double counting, total cryospheric losses are determined by adding estimates of glacier losses excluding the peripheral glaciers to losses from the ice sheets including their peripheral glaciers. The sea level contribution of all glaciers excluding those glaciers surrounding the periphery of the two ice sheets was 0.54  mm yr-1 SLE for 1901-1990, 0.62  mm yr-1 SLE for 1971-2009, 0.76  mm yr-1 SLE for 1993-2009, and 0.83  mm yr-1 SLE for 2005-2009 .	0
13.3.2.2 Modelled Global glacier mass balance models are calibrated using data from the few well-observed glaciers. Approximately 100 glacier mass balance records are available in any given year over the past half-century; only 17 glaciers exist with records of 30 years or more . Confidence in these models for projections of future change  depends on their ability to reproduce past observed glacier change using corresponding climate observations as the forcing . Model validation is challenging owing to the scarcity of independent observations , but uncertainties have been evaluated by methods such as cross validation of hindcast projections for individual glaciers drawn from the sample of glacier observations averaged for calibration . Confidence in the use of AOGCM climate simulations as input to glacier projections is gained from the agreement since the mid-20th century of glacier models forced by AOGCM simulations with glacier models forced by observations  . In the earlier 20th century, around the 1930s, glaciers at high northern latitudes lost mass at an enhanced rate ; in the model, observed forcings produced larger glacier losses than did AOGCM forcings  . This is judged likely to be due to an episode of unforced, regionally variable warming around Greenland  rather than to RF of the climate system, and is consequently	0
not reproduced by AOGCM experiments . In our analysis of the budget of GMSL rise , we take the difference between the simulations using AOGCM forcing and the simulation using observations as an estimate of the influence of unforced climate variability on global glacier mass balance . There is medium confidence in the use of glacier models to make global projections based on AOGCM results. The process-based understanding of glacier surface mass balance, the consistency of models and observations of glacier changes, and the evidence that AOGCM climate simulations can provide realistic input all give confidence, which on the other hand is limited because the set of well-observed glaciers is a very small fraction of the total.	0
13.3.3.1 Observed Mass Balance The Greenland ice sheet's mass balance is comprised of its surface mass balance and outflow, whereas Antarctica's mass budget is dominated by accumulation and outflow in the form of calving and ice flow into floating  ice shelves. Knowledge of the contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to observed sea level changes over the last two decades comes primarily from satellite and airborne surveys. Three main techniques are employed: the mass budget method, repeat altimetry, and gravimetric methods that measure temporal variations in the Earth's gravity field . Observations indicate that the Greenland contribution to GMSL has very likely increased from 0.09  mm yr-1 for 1992-2001 to 0.59  mm yr-1 for 2002-2011 . The average rate of the Antarctica contribution to sea level rise likely increased from 0.08  mm yr-1 for 1992-2001 to 0.40  mm yr-1 for 2002-2011 . For the budget period 1993-2010, the combined contribution of the ice sheets is 0.60  mm yr-1. For comparison, the AR4's assessment for the period 1993-2003 was 0.21  0.07 mm yr-1 for Greenland and 0.21  0.35 mm yr-1 for Antarctica.	0
13.3.3.2 Modelled Surface Mass Balance Projections of changes in the SMB of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are obtained from RCM or downscaled AOGCM simulations . A spatial resolution of a few tens kilometres or finer is required in order to resolve the strong gradients in SMB across the steep slopes of the ice-sheet margins. Although simulations of SMB at particular locations may have errors of 5 to 20% compared with in situ observations, there is good agreement between methods involving RCMs and observational methods of evaluating icesheet mass balance . In the present climate, for both Greenland and Antarctica, the mean SMB over the ice-sheet area is positive, giving a negative number when expressed as sea level equivalent . In Greenland, the average and standard deviation of accumulation  estimates for 1961-1990 is -1.62  0.21 mm yr-1 SLE from the models in Table 13.2, agreeing with 1153	0
All of these models indicate that Greenland ice sheet SMB showed no significant trend from the 1960s to the 1980s, then started becoming less positive  in the early 1990s, on average by 3% yr-1. This results in a statistically significant and increasing  contribution to the rate of GMSL rise . The largest trends are found in models with coupled snow and atmosphere simulations using the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model 2  and the Modele Atmospherique Regional . Van den Broeke et al.  concluded that the mass loss during 2000-2008 is equally split between SMB and dynamical change. Rignot et al.  indicated that SMB change accounts for about 60% of the mass loss since 1992 and Sasgen et al.  showed that SMB change, simulated by RACMO2 , accounts for about 60% of the observed rate of mass loss during 2002-2010, with an observational estimate of the increase in ice outflow accounting for the remainder. This satisfactory consistency, within uncertainties, in estimates for the Greenland ice-sheet mass budget gives confidence in SMB simulations of the past, and hence also in the similar models used for projections of SMB changes .	0
All Greenland SMB simulations for the first half of the 20th century depend on reconstructions of meteorological variability over the ice sheet made using empirical relationships based on observations from coastal stations and estimates of accumulation from ice cores. Despite the similar input data sets in all cases, the various climate reconstruction and SMB methods used have led to a range of results . For 1901-1990, Hanna et al.  have a time-mean GMSL contribution of -0.3 mm yr-1, while Box and Colgan  have a weakly positive contribution and the others are about zero. In all cases, there is substantial variability associated with regional climate fluctuations, in particular the warm episode in the 1930s, during which glaciers retreated in southeastern Greenland . Chylek et al.  argued that this episode was associated with the NAO rather than with global climate change.	0
together, CMIP3 AOGCMs simulate SMB for 1979-2000 of -7.1  1.5 mm yr-1 SLE , the mean being about 10% larger in magnitude than observation-based estimates, for instance -6.3 mm yr-1 SLE from Vaughan et al. . For the SMB of the grounded ice sheet alone, four global reanalysis models, with resolutions of 38 to 125 km , give -5.2  0.5 mm yr-1 SLE for 1979-2010, which compares well with an observational estimate of -4.9  0.1 mm yr-1 SLE for 1950-2000 . Because of higher accumulation near the coast, the regional climate model RACMO2 gives the somewhat larger value of -5.5  0.3 mm yr-1 SLE for 1979-2000 . This relatively good agreement, combined with the similarity of the geographical distribution of modelled and observed SMB, give medium confidence in the realism of the RCM SMB simulation. Some global reanalyses have been shown to contain spurious trends in various quantities in the SH related to changes in the observing systems, for example, new satellite observations . In the RCMs and in global reanalyses that are not affected by spurious trends, no significant trend is present in accumulation since 1980 . This agrees with observation-based studies   and implies that Antarctic SMB change has not contributed significantly to recent changes in the rate of GMSL rise. Likewise, CMIP3 historical simulations do not exhibit any systematic trend in Antarctic precipitation during the late 20th century . No observational assessments have been made of variability in SMB for the whole ice sheet for the earlier part of the 20th century, or of its longer term mean. General Circulation Model  and Regional Circulation Model  projections consistently indicate significant Antarctic warming and concomitant increase in precipitation. We have high confidence in expecting a relationship between these quantities on physical grounds  and from ice core evidence (Van Ommen et al., 2004;	0
Changes in water storage on land in response to climate change and variability  and from direct human-induced effects  have the potential to contribute to sea level change. Based on satellite observations of the Northern Hemisphere  snowpack, Biancamaria et al.  found no significant trend in the contribution of snow to sea level. Estimates of climate-related changes in land water storage over the past few decades rely on global hydrological models because corresponding observations are inadequate . In assessing the relation between terrestrial water storage and climate, Milly et al.  and Ngo-Duc et al.  found no long-term climatic trend in total water storage, but documented interannual to decadal fluctuations, equivalent to several millimetres of sea level. Recent studies have shown that interannual variability in observed GMSL correlates with ENSO indices  and is inversely related to ENSO-driven changes of terrestrial water storage, especially in the tropics . During El Nino events, sea level  tends to be higher because ocean precipitation increases and land precipitation decreases in the tropics . The reverse happens during La Nina events, as 1155	0
seen during 2010-2011, when there was a decrease in GMSL due to a temporary increase in water storage on the land, especially in Australia, northern South America, and southeast Asia  . Direct human interventions on land water storage also induce sea level changes . The largest contributions come from impoundment in reservoirs and groundwater withdrawal. Over the past half-century, storage in tens of thousands of reservoirs has offset some of the sea level rise that would otherwise have occurred. Chao et al.  estimated that the nearly 30,000 reservoirs built during the 20th century resulted in nominal reservoir storage up to 2007 equivalent to ~23 mm of sea level fall , with a stabilization in recent years. Chao et al. further assumed that the reservoirs were 85% full, and by including seepage into groundwater as estimated from a model, they obtained a total of 30 mm of sea level fall . Their seepage estimate was argued to be unrealistically large, however, because it assumes aquifers are infinite and have no interfering boundary conditions . Chao et al.  argued that sedimentation of reservoirs does not reduce their sea level contribution, but their argument is disputed . Lettenmaier and Milly  suggested a loss of capacity due to sedimentation at 1% yr-1. Given the uncertainty about them, neither the seepage nor the effect of sedimentation is included in the budget . Here the  GMSL contribution from reservoir storage is estimated as 85%  of the nominal capacity ). Konikow  estimated that human-induced groundwater depletion contributed 0.26  0.07 mm yr-1 to GMSL rise over 1971-2008 and 0.34  0.07 mm yr-1 over 1993-2008 , whereas Wada et al.  estimated values of 0.42  0.08 mm yr-1 over 1971-2008 and 0.54  0.09 mm yr-1 over 1993-2008 . The average of these two series with the difference as a measure of the uncertainty is used in the sea level budget . Pokhrel et al.  estimated a larger groundwater depletion, but Konikow  ) argued that their underlying assumptions of defining depletion as equivalent to groundwater use, and allowing unlimited extraction to meet water demand, led to substantial overestimates of depletion.	0
In summary, climate-related changes in water and snow storage on land do not show significant long-term trends for the recent decades. However, direct human interventions in land water storage  have each contributed at least several tenths of mm yr-1 of sea level change . Reservoir impoundment exceeded groundwater depletion for the majority of the 20th century but groundwater depletion has increased and now exceeds current rates of impoundment, contributing to an increased rate of GMSL rise. The net contribution for the 20th century is estimated by adding the average of the two groundwater depletion estimates to the reservoir storage term . The trends are -0.11  mm yr-1 for 1901-1990, 0.12  mm	0
As discussed in Chapter 3, it has been possible to directly estimate changes in ocean mass using satellite gravity data from GRACE since 2002 . These measurements represent the sum of total land ice plus land water components, and thus provide an independent assessment of these contributions. However, GRACE is also sensitive to mass redistribution associated with GIA and requires that this effect   be removed before estimating the ocean-mass component. Most recent estimates  report a global mean ocean mass increase of 1.8  mm yr-1 over 2003-2012 after correcting for the GIA component. The associated error results from the low signal-to-noise ratio over the ocean domain and uncertainty in the model-based GIA correction . Chapter 3 notes that, in terms of global averages, the sum of the contribution to GMSL due to change in global ocean mass , measured by GRACE, and the contribution due to global ocean thermal expansion , measured by the Argo Project, agrees within uncertainties with the GMSL change observed by satellite altimetry , although there is still a missing contribution from expansion in the deep ocean below 2000 m. These data sets have allowed an investigation of the cause of variability in sea level over the last few years . In particular, Boening et al.  concluded that the decrease in GMSL over 2010-2011 followed by a rapid increase since 2011 was related to the 2011 La Nina event, whereby changes in land/ocean precipitation patterns caused a temporary increase in water storage on the land  during the La Nina event, especially in Australia, northern South America and southeast Asia .	0
are unimportant on multi-decadal time scales . Contributions due to runoff from thawed permafrost, change in atmospheric moisture content, and sedimentation in the ocean are not considered in the budget because they are negligible compared with observed GMSL rise and the uncertainties. For 1993-2010, allowing for uncertainties, the observed GMSL rise is consistent with the sum of the observationally estimated contributions  . The two largest terms are ocean thermal expansion  and glacier mass loss . Observations indicate an increased ice-sheet contribution over the last two decades  . The closure of the observational budget since 1993, within uncertainties, represents a significant advance since the AR4 in physical understanding of the causes of past GMSL change, and provides an improved basis for critical evaluation of models of these contributions in order to assess their reliability for making projections. The observational budget cannot be rigorously assessed for 1901-1990 or 1971-2010 because there is insufficient observational information	0
to estimate ice-sheet contributions with high confidence before the 1990s, and ocean data sampling is too sparse to permit an estimate of global mean thermal expansion before the 1970s. However, a closed observational GMSL budget since the 1970s can be demonstrated with reasonable estimates of ice-sheet contributions  . For 1971-2010, the observed contributions from thermal expansion and mass loss from glaciers  alone explain about 75% of the observed GMSL . AOGCM-based estimates of thermal expansion, which agree well with observations since 1971, observational estimates of the glacier contribution, and the estimated change in land water storage , which is relatively small, can all be made from the start of the 20th century . Model estimates of Greenland ice-sheet SMB changes give an uncertain but relatively small contribution during most of the 20th century, increasing since the early 1990s . There could be a small constant contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet  due to long-term adjustment to climate change in previous millennia. Any secular rate of sea level rise in the late Holocene was small  (Section 1157	0

13.2.1.4), probably less than 0.2 mm yr-1 . Including these ice-sheet contributions , GMSL rise during the 20th century can be accounted for within uncertainties, including the observation that the linear trend of GMSL rise during the last 50 years is little larger than for the 20th century, despite the increasing anthropogenic forcing . Model-based attribution of sea level change to RFs is discussed in Section 10.4.3. The sum of CMIP5 AOGCM thermal expansion , glacier model results with CMIP5 AOGCM input ), and anthropogenic intervention in land water storage  accounts for about 65% of the observed rate of GMSL rise for 1901-1990, and 90% for 1971-2010 and 1993-2010  . In all periods, the residual is small enough to be attributed to the ice sheets . The unusually warm conditions in the Arctic during the 1930s , which are attributed to unforced climate variability  and are therefore not expected to be simulated by AOGCMs, likely produced a greater mass loss by glaciers in high northern latitudes . The difference between the glacier mass loss calculated with the Marzeion et al.  model when it is forced with observed climate rather than AOGCM simulated climate  is an estimate of this effect. If the glacier model results for observational input are used , not including glaciers in Antarctica) and an illustrative value of 0.1 mm yr-1 is included for a long-term Antarctic contribution,	0
the model mean is within 20% of the observed GMSL rise for the 20th century , and 10% since 1993 ). When the observed icesheet contributions since 1992 are included as well, the sum is almost equivalent to the observed rise . Both observations and models have a maximum rate of rise in the 1930-1950 period, a minimum rate in the 1960s and a maximum rate over the last two decades . This agreement provides evidence that the larger rate of rise since 1990, with a significant component of ocean thermal expansion , results from increased RF  and increased ice-sheet discharge, rather than a natural oscillation  . In summary, the evidence now available gives a clearer account of observed GMSL change than in previous IPCC assessments, in two respects. First, reasonable agreement can be demonstrated throughout the period since 1900 between GMSL rise as observed and as calculated from the sum of contributions. From 1993, all contributions can be estimated from observations; for earlier periods, a combination of models and observations is needed. Second, when both models and observations are available, they are consistent within uncertainties. These two advances give confidence in the 21st century sea level projections. The ice-sheet contributions have the potential to increase substantially due to rapid dynamical change  but have been relatively small up to the present . Therefore, the closure of the sea level budget to date does not test the reliability of ice-sheet models in projecting future rapid dynamical change; we have only medium confidence in these models, on the basis of theoretical and empirical understanding of the relevant processes and observations of changes up to the present .	0
Box 13.1 | The Global Energy Budget The global energy balance is a fundamental aspect of the Earth's climate system. At the top of the atmosphere , the boundary of the climate system, the balance involves shortwave radiation received from the Sun, and shortwave radiation reflected and longwave radiation emitted by the Earth . The rate of storage of energy in the Earth system must be equal to the net downward radiative flux at the TOA. The TOA fluxes  have been measured by the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment  satellites from 1985 to 1999  and the Cloud and the Earth's Radiant Energy System  satellites from March 2000 to the present . The TOA radiative flux measurements are highly precise, allowing identification of changes in the Earth's net energy budget from year to year within the ERBE and CERES missions , but the absolute calibration of the instruments is not sufficiently accurate to allow determination of the absolute TOA energy flux or to provide continuity across missions . The ocean has stored more than 90% of the increase in energy in the climate system over recent decades , resulting in ocean thermal expansion and hence sea level rise . Thus the energy and sea level budgets are linked and must be consistent . This Box focusses on the Earth's global energy budget since 1970 when better global observational data coverage is available. The RFs , the global averaged surface temperatures  , and the rate of energy storage are relative to the time mean of 1860 to 1879. Otto et al.  used an energy imbalance over this reference period of 0.08  0.03 W m-2, which is subtracted from the observed energy storage.  1159	0
Since 1970, the effective radiative forcing  of the climate system has been positive as a result of increased greenhouse gas  concentrations  and a small increase in solar irradiance . This positive ERF has been partly compensated by changes in tropospheric aerosols which predominantly reflect sunlight and modify cloud properties and structure in ways that tend to reinforce the negative ERF, although black carbon produces positive forcing. Explosive volcanic eruptions  can inject sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere, giving rise to stratospheric aerosol, which persists for several years. This reflects some of the incoming solar radiation, and thus gives a further negative forcing. Changes in surface albedo from land-use change have also led to a greater reflection of shortwave radiation back to space and hence a negative forcing. Since 1970, the net ERF of the climate system  has increased , resulting in a cumulative total energy inflow . From 1971 to 2010, the total energy inflow  is estimated to be 790  ZJ .	0
Box 13.1, Figure 1 | The Earth's energy budget from 1970 through 2011.  The cumulative energy flux into the Earth system from changes in well-mixed and shortlived greenhouse gases, solar forcing, changes in tropospheric aerosol forcing, volcanic forcing and surface albedo  are shown by the coloured lines and these are added to give the cumulative energy inflow .  The cumulative total energy inflow from  is balanced by the sum of the warming of the Earth system  and an increase in outgoing radiation inferred from changes in the global averaged surface temperature. The sum of these two terms is given for a climate feedback parameter  of 0.82, 1.23 and 2.47 W m-2 C-1 . The energy budget would be closed for a particular value of  if that line coincided with the total energy inflow. For clarity, all uncertainties  shown are for a likely range.	0
strong evidence of a changing climate. The majority of this additional heat is in the upper 700 m of the ocean but there is also warming in the deep and abyssal ocean . The associated thermal expansion of the ocean has contributed about 40% of the observed sea level rise since 1971 ). A small amount of additional heat has been used to warm the continents, warm and melt glacial and sea ice, and warm the atmosphere. The estimated increase in energy in the Earth system between 1971 and 2010 is 274  ZJ . As the climate system warms, energy is lost to space through increased outgoing radiation. This radiative response by the system is predominantly due to increased thermal grey-body radiation emitted by the atmosphere and surface, but is modified by climate feedbacks, such as changes in water vapour, surface albedo and clouds, which affect both outgoing longwave and reflected shortwave radiation. Following Murphy et al. , Box 13.1, Figure 1b relates the cumulative total energy inflow to the Earth system to the change in energy storage and the cumulative outgoing radiation. Calculation of the latter is based on the observed globally averaged surface temperature change T relative to a reference temperature for which the Earth system would be in radiative balance. This temperature change is multiplied by the climate feedback parameter , which in turn is related to the equilibrium climate sensitivity. For equilibrium climate sensitivities of 4.5C, 3.0C to 1.5C  and an ERF for a doubled CO2 concentration of 3.7  0.74 W m-2 , the corresponding estimates of the climate feedback parameter  are 0.82, 1.23 and 2.47 W m-2 C-1. In addition to these forced variations in the Earth's energy budget, there is also internal variability on decadal time scales. Observations and models indicate that because of the comparatively small heat capacity of the atmosphere, a decade of steady or even decreasing surface temperature can occur in a warming world . General Circulation Model simulations indicate that these periods are associated with a transfer of heat from the upper to the deeper ocean, of order 0.1 W m-2 , with a near steady  or an increased radiation to space , again of order 0.1 W m-2. Although these natural fluctuations represent a large amount of heat, they are significantly smaller than the anthropogenic forcing of the Earth's energy budget , particularly when looking at time scales of several decades or more . These independent estimates of ERF, observed heat storage, and surface warming combine to give an energy budget for the Earth that is consistent with the assessed likely range of climate sensitivity  to within estimated uncertainties . Quantification of the terms in the Earth's energy budget and verification that these terms balance over recent decades provides strong evidence for our understanding of anthropogenic climate change. Changes in the Earth's energy storage are a powerful observation for the detection and attribution of climate change  .	0
More than 90% of the net energy increase of the climate system on multiannual time scales is stored in the ocean . GMSL rise due to thermal expansion is approximately proportional to the increase in ocean heat content. The constant of proportionality is 0.11  0.01 m per 1024 J for the ensemble of CMIP5 models ; it depends on the vertical and latitudinal distribution of warming in the ocean, because the expansion of sea water per degree Celsius of warming is greater at higher temperature and higher pressure . For the early decades of the 21st century, the upper ocean dominates the ocean heat uptake, and ocean heat content rises roughly linearly with global mean surface air temperature  change . On multi-decadal time scales under scenarios of steadily increasing RF, the rate of increase of ocean heat	0
content is approximately proportional to the global mean SAT change from equilibrium , with the constant of proportionality  being the ocean heat uptake efficiency k. The ocean heat uptake efficiency quantifies the effect of ocean heat uptake on moderating time-dependent climate change; neglecting the small fraction of heat stored elsewhere in the climate system, the surface warming can be approximated as F/, where F is the RF and a is the climate feedback parameter , and hence the rate of ocean heat uptake is approximately kF/. In CMIP3 and CMIP5, the model spread in projections of surface warming is dominated by the spread in F and a, but the spread in k accounts for a substantial part of the spread in projections of ocean heat uptake . The spread in k relates to differences among models in heat-transport processes within the ocean. The warming spreads downwards from the surface over time, and the greatest increases in projected ocean 1161	0
heat content occur where the warming penetrates most deeply, in the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic  . Changes in convection and the largescale vertical circulation are particularly important to heat uptake in the North Atlantic . Heat is also transported vertically by eddies, especially in the Southern Ocean, and by turbulent mixing. These processes are parameterized in models when they occur at unresolved scales. Observed ocean heat uptake has been used in conjunction with observed global SAT change to constrain the ocean effective thermal diffusivity representing all unresolved vertical transports in simple climate models and EMICs . The simulated ocean vertical temperature profile and the depth of penetration of the warming in AOGCMs have also been evaluated by comparison with observations, and both bear a relationship to k . Such comparisons suggest that model projections might be biased towards overestimating ocean heat uptake and thermal expansion for a given surface warming . The physical causes of this tendency are unclear. Although the simulated vertical temperature profile is affected by the model representation of vertical heat transport processes, Brierley et al.  found only a small effect on k from variation of model parameters that influence interior heat transport. Because the ocean integrates the surface heat flux, thermal expansion projections following different scenarios do not significantly diverge for several decades. Scenarios assuming strong mitigation of GHG emissions begin to show a reduced rate of thermal expansion beyond about 2040; the amount by 2100 is about one third less than in a non-mitigation scenario (Washington et al., 2009; Pardaens et al.,	0
2011b; Korper et al., 2013), and half as much in RCP2.6 as in RCP8.5  . The integrating effect means that thermal expansion depends not only on the cumulative total, but also on the pathway of CO2 emissions; reducing emissions earlier rather than later, for the same cumulative total, leads to a larger mitigation of sea level rise due to thermal expansion . The integrating effect also means that annual time series of global ocean thermal expansion show less interannual variability than time series of global SAT. For the present assessment of GMSL rise, projections of ocean heat uptake and thermal expansion up to 2100 have been derived from the CMIP5 AOGCMs . Methods are described in Section 13.5.1 and the Supplementary Material and the results for ocean heat uptake are shown in Figure 13.8, and for thermal expansion in Table 13.5 and Figures 13.10 and 13.11. Ocean heat uptake efficiency is not constant on time scales of many decades or in scenarios of stable or decreasing RF . A good representation of AOGCM behaviour is obtained by distinguishing a shallow layer, which is associated with surface temperature variations on decadal time scales, from a deep layer, which has the majority of the heat capacity . Ocean heat uptake and thermal expansion take place not only while atmospheric GHG concentrations are rising, but continue for many centuries to millennia after stabilization of RF, at a rate which declines on a centennial time scale . This is because the time scale for warming the deep ocean is much longer than for the shallow ocean .	0
Figure 13.8 | Heat uptake by the climate system during the 21st century relative to 1986-2005 projected by CMIP5 Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models  under RCP scenarios . The heat uptake is diagnosed by two different methods. The thick solid lines, and the coloured ranges for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, are the time- and global integral of the net downward radiative flux perturbation at the top of the atmosphere, from the 21 AOGCMs used to make the global mean sea level projections . The broken solid lines, and the thin solid lines delimiting ranges for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, are the global volume integral of ocean temperature change, in a smaller and different set of AOGCMs for each scenario. The difference between the two diagnoses is due partly to the different sets of models , and partly to heat uptake in other parts of the simulated climate system than the ocean water. In both methods, climate drift in the pre-industrial control run has been subtracted.	0
The rate and the stabilization time scale for thermal expansion depend on the GHG stabilization level. For the highest scenario , GMSL rise due to thermal expansion can exceed 2 m above the pre-industrial level by the year 2500 , and is still rising at that time. Changes in ocean circulation, particularly due to a reduction in deep water formation, can also have a large effect on global ocean heat uptake, and may relate nonlinearly to global surface warming . As the rate of ocean heat uptake decreases, the surface warming approaches the level determined by the equilibrium climate sensitivity. On a multi-millennial time scale, the range from Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity suggests that thermal expansion contributes between 0.20 to 0.63 m per degree Celsius of global mean temperature increase  . The median of the six models of 0.42 m C-1 is consistent with a thermal expansion of 0.38 m C-1 that would result from a uniform increase in ocean temperature from the presently observed temperature and salinity distribution . Uncertainty arises due to the different spatial distribution of the warming in models and the dependence of the expansion on local temperature and salinity.	0
The 21st century sea level contribution from glaciers presented in the AR4 assessment ranged from 0.06 to 0.15 m SLE by 2100 across a range of scenarios . The Randolph Glacier Inventory   has improved projections of glacier contribution to sea level rise by providing the first globally complete accounting of glacier location, area, and area-elevation distribution . Several analyses of scenario-dependent SMB glacier projections  have been produced using the RGI, including Marzeion et al. , Giesen and Oerlemans , and Radi et al. . The Marzieon and Radi approaches each used different suites of CMIP5 AOGCM models to calculate SMB terms from RCP forcings, and the model by Slangen and van de Wal  was used to calculate SMB terms from RCP forcings . Giesen and Oerlemans  used CRU forcing but calculated SMB from three different combinations of variations in modelled temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric transmissivity. Only their results for varying temperature are shown here. Machguth et al.  is also included in Table 13.3, but this projection represents changes in Greenland peripheral glaciers only, and is not included in the global glacier summaries. Although these details differ among the models, all share a generally common time-evolving structure, with SMB initially determined by model-generated climate forcing applied to a subset of global glaciers, the ensuing volume change converted to area change via volume-area scaling, and this result upscaled to a new global distribution and hypsometry to create initial conditions for the subsequent time step. These methods are described further in Section13.5.1 and in the Supplementary Material. Related results are shown in Table 13.5 and Figures 13.10 and 13.11. Although the peripheral glaciers surrounding the ice sheets are included with the ice sheets in assessment of present-day changes (Table	0
13.1), future projections should ideally assess the peripheral glaciers separately, as these are too small and dynamically responsive to be modelled adequately with coarse-grid, non-dynamic ice-sheet SMB models. The peripheral glaciers surrounding both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are thus included in the process-based models described above, but for projections shown in Table 13.5, the Antarctic peripheral glaciers are included with the Antarctic ice sheet whereas the Greenland peripheral glaciers are included with the remaining world's glaciers. Projected losses from glaciers peripheral to both ice sheets are listed separately in Table 13.3. Several glacier loss projections derived from model types other than process-based models have been published since 2007; their projections range from 0.08 to 0.39 m SLE by 2100 . These used methods of projecting future losses from glaciers developed in response to the absence of a global compilation of glacier observations after 2005 and the absence of a globally complete glacier inventory to provide geographic boundary conditions for conventional modelling. These methods include extrapolation from observed rates , semi-empirical methods applied to sea level change components , kinematic  projections , and power-law scaling estimates based on re-establishing equilibrium accumulation-area ratios  from initial non-equilibrium AARs . Strengths of these approaches include the fact that observations used to calibrate extrapolation and semi-empirical projection partially account for future dynamically forced losses, that semi-empirical methods use modelled future forcings as guidance for projections, and that AAR equilibration has strong physical and theoretical underpinnings and gives generalized but robust projections. These strengths partially offset the weaknesses of these models, which include, in the case of extrapolation and semi-empirical projection, an assumption of statistical stationarity that may not be valid, while the AAR equilibration approach gives only a final steady state value, so that rates or cumulative losses at any intermediate time must be estimated by area-response time scaling. However, these alternate methods are valuable because of their construction on fundamental and robust principles together with their use of the limited available information to produce projections that, although imprecise, are transparent, and require less detailed input information or knowledge of details of complex processes in comparison to process-based models. Published results from process-based models are shown in Table 13.3. Glacier contributions at 2100, expressed as SLE, range between 0.04 and 0.11 m for Special Report on Emission Scenarios  A1B, 0.07 and 0.17 m for RCP2.6, between 0.07 and 0.20 m for RCP4.5, between 0.07 and 0.20 m for RCP6.0, and between 0.12 and 0.26 m for RCP8.5. The projections derived from alternative models are also shown in Table 13.3; the mean and range of these models listed here is 0.24  m SLE, consistent with the process-based models. Results from the process-based models, plotted as time series and grouped by forcing scenario, are shown in Figure 13.9. See Table 13.3 for specific start/ end dates for each projection. Unresolved uncertainties in the projection of glacier contributions to sea level rise include the potential for near-term dynamic response 1163	0

of greater RF lead to a larger sea level contribution. Precipitation is projected to increase at about 5% per C of annual-mean warming over Greenland, but the increase in snowfall is smaller because the fraction of rain increases as temperature rises .

The time-integral of the Greenland SMB anomaly with respect to a reference period is interpreted as a contribution to GMSL rise, on the assumption that the ice sheet was in approximate mass balance during the reference period ; this assumption can be avoided only if ice-sheet outflow is also modelled. Making this assumption, the Greenland SMB contribution lies in the range 0.00 to 0.13 m for these two scenarios. The spread in the magnitude and patterns of Greenland climate change projected by the AOGCMs causes a large part of the spread in the	0
projected contribution to GMSL rise . Yoshimori and AbeOuchi  found that the inter-model spread in global mean SAT change accounts for about 60% of the spread in the change of projected Greenland ablation. Two important contributions to the remaining spread are the weakening of the AMOC, which affects the magnitude of warming over Greenland, and the SAT of Greenland in the model control climate, which affects the sensitivity of melting to warming . Ablation is computed using either an EBM, which may be stand-alone or part of a regional climate model, or from surface air temperature using an empirical temperature index method, mostly commonly the positive-degree-day  method, in which melting is proportional to the time-integral of temperature above the freezing point. Meltwater production increases faster than linearly with temperature increase because of reduced albedo due to refreezing of meltwater in the snowpack and expansion of the area of bare ice . The simulation of this positive albedo feedback on mass loss depends sensitively on the model	0
Notes: a The spatial resolution is stated and the surface mass balance  method denoted by TI = temperature index, PDD = positive degree day, EBM = Energy Balance Model. b The amount of sea level rise is the time-integral of the SMB anomaly from the period or date labelled `starting from' to the one labelled `up to'. Unless otherwise indicated, the SMB anomaly is calculated relative to the mean SMB for the `starting from' period, and the rate of sea level rise is the SMB anomaly in the `up to' period. c These results are estimated from global mean surface air temperature  change, using formulae fitted to results from a Greenland SMB model. d The SMB anomaly is relative to the late 19th century. e This experiment used time-slices, with boundary conditions from the European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecasts  and Hamburg 5  GCM, rather than a simulation of the complete century; thus, results are not available for the amount. f Fettweis et al.  and Franco et al.  used a hybrid approach: they derived a regression relationship from simulations of the recent past using a Regional Climate Model , incorporating an EBM, between annual anomalies in Greenland climate and in Greenland SMB, then applied this relationship to project future SMB from projected future climate anomalies. The method assumes that a relationship derived from past variability will also hold for future forced climate change. g Range including uncertainty in choice of emission scenario , SMB modelling and ice-sheet dynamical modelling, as well as uncertainty in climate modelling. h Results are given for the Hadley Centre Regional Model 3P , High-Resolution Hamburg climate model 5  and the Modele Atmospherique Regional  RCMs driven with the same boundary conditions from the ECHAM5/MPI-OM AOGCM. i Results are given for two ice sheet models ) using the same AOGCM climate boundary conditions.

snow-albedo parameterization . Goelzer et al.  projected 14 to 31% more runoff during the 21st century when using an EBM than when using a PDD method, mainly because of the omission of the albedo feedback in the latter. However, other studies using temperature index methods  have ranges extending to higher values than those from EBMs, indicating that this is not the only difference between these classes of methods . SMB simulations are also particularly sensitive to the treatment of meltwater refreezing . The pore space in the present-day percolation zone could accommodate 1 to 5 mm SLE of refrozen meltwater over the next several decades , and the importance of meltwater refreezing will become greater as melting becomes prevalent in areas where it has previously been rare. On the other hand, refreezing will be restricted, and runoff consequently increased, by the expansion of the area of bare ice . Another source of model spread is the representation of topography, which is lower when represented at coarser resolution. This allows precipitation to spread further inland because of reduced topographic barriers , and enhances ablation because there is more area at lower, warmer altitudes . Most of the models in Table 13.4 use a fixed Greenland topography, and thus cannot simulate the positive feedback on ablation that can be expected as the ice-sheet surface becomes lower. Dynamical models are required to simulate this effect . For the present assessment of GMSL rise, changes in Greenland ice sheet SMB up to 2100 have been computed from global mean SAT change projections derived from the CMIP5 AOGCMs, following methods described in Section 13.5.1 and the Supplementary Material. The distribution of results, shown in Table 13.5 and Figures 13.10 and 13.11, covers the ranges obtained using the methods of Fettweis et al. , Gregory and Huybrechts , and Yoshimori and Abe-Ouchi . On multi-centennial to millennial time scales, feedbacks between regional climate and the ice sheet become increasingly relevant, especially under strong climate change scenarios, thus requiring coupled climate ice-sheet models to capture potential feedbacks beyond the year 2100. These models apply a reduced spatial resolution in order to be computationally efficient enough to evaluate longer time scales and to combine the different climatic components. Consistent with regional climate models for the 21st century, they project an increasingly negative mass balance for the Greenland ice sheet for all warming scenarios which is mainly due to a decreasing SMB . The main feedbacks between climate and the ice sheet arise from changes in ice elevation, atmospheric and ocean circulation, and sea-ice distribution. Comparing the different feedbacks, high confidence can be assigned to the models' ability to capture the feedback between SMB and sur-	0
face elevation. As a consequence, a nonlinear increase in ice loss from Greenland with increasing regional RF is found across different scenarios . This nonlinearity arises from the increase in both the length of the ablation season and the daily amount of melting as the ice-sheet surface lowers. This SMB-surface elevation feedback is also the main reason for the threshold behaviour of the Greenland ice sheet on multi-millennial time scales . Medium-to-low confidence is assigned to the models' representation of the atmospheric and ocean circulation and sea-ice changes. On multi-centennial time scales, Swingedouw et al.  found enhanced ice loss from Greenland in a coupled simulation  in which ice topography and meltwater flux influence the ocean and atmospheric circulation as well as sea-ice distribution. Vizcaino et al.  found reduced ice loss due to the coupling, mainly caused by the effect of topographic changes on the surface temperature, but less pronounced in amplitude compared with Swingedouw et al. . Both the atmospheric circulation and the ocean currents, especially in coastal areas, are poorly resolved by these models. It is therefore likely that the time scales associated with ocean transport processes are distorted and there is low confidence that these feedbacks, although existent, can be quantified accurately by the applied models. The AMOC exerts a strong influence on regional climate around the Greenland ice sheet and consequently its SMB. Most CMIP5 models show a reduction of the AMOC under future warming during the 21st century and beyond . Although coupled climate-ice sheet models show some influence of meltwater from Greenland on the AMOC, the uncertainty between models with respect to the AMOC response to warming is significantly larger than the difference between simulations with or without this feedback within one model. In the coupled climate-ice sheet model applied by Mikolajewicz et al.  and Vizcaino et al. , the AMOC shows a strongly nonlinear response to global warming. A weak AMOC reduction is found for 1%-per-year-CO2-increase scenarios up to 560 and 840 ppm, and a near-complete cessation of the AMOC for 1120 ppm. As a consequence, after 600 years of integration, the sea level contribution for the 1120 ppm scenario is similar to that of the 560 ppm scenario, but doubles for the medium scenario, which stabilizes at 840 ppm. In the most recent model version , the AMOC shows a strong weakening of the AMOC in all scenarios . The total sea level contribution from Greenland, including the effect of the AMOC weakening, is ~1 m  for 560 ppm CO2 and ~3 m  for 1120 ppm CO2. Even though the AMOC weakening in the model by Huybrechts et al.  is less pronounced , the ice loss through melting is significantly weaker in this model. During the first 1000 years of integration, the Greenland ice sheet contributes 0.36 m  for 560 ppm CO2 and 2.59 m  for 1120 ppm CO2. In Huybrechts et al. , the respective increases in global mean SAT are 2.4C  and 6.3C  after 1000 years with respect to pre-industrial. This relatively weak warming response to GHG forcing compared to CMIP5 models and 1167	0
the climate model used in Vizcaino et al.  explains the relatively small sea level response. Using the same model as Huybrechts et al. , albeit with a slightly higher polar warming, Goelzer et al.  computed temperatures and sea level under the SRES scenarios B1, A1B and A2, with subsequent GHG stabilization after the year 2100. As in Huybrechts et al. , the ice-sheet evolution is dominated by the SMB. They find sea level contributions of 1.4, 2.6 and 4.2 m in the year 3000 for the scenarios B1, A1B and B2, which correspond to mean rates of sea level rise of 1.4 mm yr-1, 2.6 mm yr-1, and 4.2 mm yr-1, respectively. In summary, coupled climate-ice sheet models consistently show an increasingly negative mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet due mainly to a decreasing SMB under warming scenarios on centennial time scales beyond 2100. On multi-millennial time scales, these models show a threshold temperature beyond which the melting of the Greenland ice sheet self-amplifies and the ice volume is reduced to less than 30% of its present volume .	0
13.4.3.2 Dynamical Change Observations suggest three main mechanisms by which climate change can affect the dynamics of ice flow in Greenland : by directly affecting ice loss  through the calving of icebergs and marine melt from marine-terminating outlet glaciers; by altering basal sliding through the interaction of surface melt water with the glacier bed; and indirectly through the interaction between SMB and ice flow. We assess the consequences of each of these processes. Section 4.4.3.2 presents the observational basis on which concerns about increased ice loss by calving and marine melt are based. In particular, recent increases in loss are thought to be linked to the migration of subtropical water masses around the coast of Greenland  and its occupation of coastal fjords . Output from 19 AOGCMs under scenario A1B showed warming of 1.7C to 2.0C around Greenland over the course of the 21st century , suggesting that the trend towards increased outflow triggered by warming coastal waters will continue.	0
Although projections of outflow are at a fairly early stage, literature now exists to make an assessment. Flowline modelling has successfully simulated the observed retreat and associated acceleration of the main outlet glaciers of the Greenland ice sheet ; Jakobshavn Isbrae ). The same model has been used to project mass loss from these glaciers , as well as Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier, using ocean and atmosphere forcing based on scenarios A1B and RCP8.5. At 2100, total projected SLR spans 8 to 13 mm for A1B and 11 to 17 mm for RCP8.5. These figures generalize to 40 to 63 mm and 57 to 85 mm, respectively, for the whole ice sheet based on a simple scaling between modelled and total ice-sheet area . Price et al.  modelled the century-scale response of the ice sheet to the observed recent retreat of three outlet glaciers . At 2100, the projected SLR associated with the three modelled outlet glaciers is 0.6 to 1.4 mm, 1168	0
which equates to SLR of 4 to 8 mm after scaling  to all outlet glaciers based on observed mass loss . Total projected SLR then varies between 10 and 45 mm at 2100 if successive retreats are specified with a notional repeat interval between 50 and 10 years. Goelzer et al.  implemented the Nick et al.  retreat chronology within a 5-km resolution ice-sheet model along with their own generalization for including unsampled outlet glaciers. Associated SLR at 2100 is projected to vary between 8 and 18 mm. Graversen et al.  attempted to capture the effect of increased outflow by enhancing basal sliding and generated SLR of 9 to 24 mm at 2100. Two estimates of the effect of dynamical change on Greenland's contribution to SLR by 2100 have been made on the basis of physical intuition. Pfeffer et al.  developed a low scenario by assuming a first-decade doubling of outlet glacier velocity throughout the ice sheet that equates to 93 mm SLR, while a high scenario that assumes an order of magnitude increase on the same time scale contributes 467 mm. Katsman et al.  used a similar methodology to obtain an estimate of 100 mm SLR. Based primarily on Nick et al. , we assess the upper limit of the likely range of this dynamical effect to be 85 mm for RCP8.5 and 63 mm for all other RCP scenarios for the year 2100. We have medium confidence in this as an upper limit because it is compatible with Katsman et al. , the low scenario of Pfeffer et al. , and Price et al.  in the probable event of a sub-decadal recurrence interval. Although the likely upper limit is less than the high scenario of Pfeffer et al. , process modelling gives no support to the order of magnitude increase in flow on which this scenario is based. It is higher than the contributions found by Goelzer et al.  and Graversen et al.  for which there are two potential explanations. First, the generalization used to extrapolate from the modelled sample to all outlet glaciers differs. Nick et al.  used a scaling similar to the independently derived value of Price et al. , while the implied scaling used by Goelzer et al.  is substantially lower. Second, Goelzer et al.  suggested that surface ice melt and calving each remove marginal ice , implying that by not including surface melt, overall mass loss by dynamics may be over predicted by the flowline model of Nick et al. . At present, these studies cannot be reconciled and we therefore use the more inclusive range. The lower limit of the likely range is assessed as 20 mm for RCP8.5 and 14 mm for all other RCP scenarios. This reflects the individual outlet glacier projections of Nick et al.  but uses a lower generalization more similar to that found by Goelzer et al. . This assessment of the lower limit is compatible with Price et al.  and Graversen et al. . Section 4.4.3.2 assesses understanding of the link between abundant summer meltwater, lubrication of the ice-sheet base, and enhanced ice flow. Although this mechanism appears important in modulating present-day ice flow, it is not supported as the cause of recent mass loss. Goelzer et al.  incorporated a parameterization of this effect based on field observations, which results in less than a millimetre SLR by 2100 in their projections. Bindschadler et al.  reported a suite	0
of experiments assessing this effect in an eight-model ensemble, but their parameterization appears overly simplistic and may well exaggerate the importance of the effect. These projections do not incorporate the effect on ice flow of the latent heat released by increased future quantities of melt water within the ice sheet , for which no projections are currently available. Basal lubrication is therefore assessed as making an insignificant contribution to the likely range of SLR over the next century and is omitted in the remainder of the assessment. We have medium confidence in projections of this effect primarily because recent improvements in process-based understanding show that it has little contribution to mass loss ; the potential of latent-heat effects in the future limits a higher level of confidence.	0
narios by year 2100. The latter are assumed to have uniform SLR in the absence of literature allowing these scenarios to be assessed individually, although dependency on scenario is expected to exist. In addition, mass loss associated with SMB-height feedback is likely to contribute a further 0 to 15% of SMB . This equates to, for example, 0 to 14 mm by 2100 based on the central estimate of RCP8.5. The peripheral glaciers of Greenland are not included here but are in the assessment of global glaciers' contribution to SLR . All the available literature suggests that this dynamical contribution to sea level rise will continue well beyond 2100.	0
Finally, we assess the level of interaction between SMB change and ice flow. In AR4, this effect is assessed as 0  10%  of SMB, based on Huybrechts and de Wolde  and Gregory and Huybrechts . This assessment included both the positive feedback between SMB and the height of the ice sheet, and a countering negative feedback involving ice flow and depletion effects. The latter effect is partly included in our assessment of the direct impacts of climate change on ice flow, and we therefore limit our assessment to the SMB-height feedback. Few studies explicitly determine this effect, but Goelzer et al.  reported that it amounts to 5 to 15% of SMB over the course of the 21st century, which we extend slightly  to reflect possible interaction with mass loss by calving .	0
A number of model results agree in showing that the Greenland ice sheet, like other climatic subsystems  , exhibits a strongly nonlinear and potentially irreversible response to surface warming. The mechanism of this threshold behaviour is the SMB-height feedback ; that is, as the surface is lowered due to ice loss, the associated warming of the near surface increases ablation, leading to further ice loss. This feedback is small but not negligible in the 21st century  and becomes important for projections for the 22nd century  and beyond. This nonlinear behaviour may be accelerated by a reduced surface albedo caused by surface melting which tends to further decrease the surface mass balance  .	0
Goelzer et al.  and Gillet-Chaulet et al.  suggested that SMB and ice dynamics cannot be assessed separately because of the strong interaction between ice loss and climate due to, for instance, calving and SMB. The current assessment has by necessity separated these effects because the type of coupled ice sheet-climate models needed to make a full assessment do not yet exist. These interactions may well combine to reduce SLR in comparison to the assessed range because of the mass-depletion effect of retreating outlet glaciers. Another source of uncertainty is the bedrock topography of Greenland, although recent improvements in data coverage  suggest that the majority of the ice sheet rests on bedrock above sea level and the number of deep bedrock troughs penetrating into the interior of Greenland are limited, thus limiting the potential for marine ice-sheet instability . Although not strictly comparable because they contain a different balance of ice-dynamical effects, the assessment is consistent with Bindschadler et al. , who reported an extensive model inter-comparison exercise in which standardized experiments are combined to represent the impact of climate change under RCP8.5 on the Greenland ice sheet. The resultant projection included contributions from lubrication, marine melt and SMB-coupling and generated a mean SLR at 2100 of 162 mm over five models, or 53 mm if an outlier with anomalously high response is removed . This comparison provides further weight to our confidence. In summary, dynamical change within the Greenland ice sheet is likely  to lead to SLR during the next century with a range of 20 to 85 mm for RCP8.5, and 14 to 63 mm for all other sce-	0
Although the mean SMB of the Greenland ice sheet is positive, in a steady state it must be balanced by ice outflow, so the ice sheet must extend to the coast. In a warmer climate, the mean SMB is reduced  and the steady-state ice sheet will have a lower surface and volume. Models show a threshold in surface warming beyond which self-amplifying feedbacks result in a partial or near-complete ice loss on Greenland . If a temperature above this threshold is maintained over a multi-millennial time period, the majority of the Greenland ice sheet will be lost by changes in SMB on a millennial to multi-millennial time scale . During the Middle Pliocene warm intervals, when global mean temperature was 2C to 3.5C higher than pre-industrial, ice-sheet models suggest near-complete deglaciation of Greenland . A simplifying assumption is that the threshold is the warming required with the current ice-sheet topography to reduce the mean SMB to zero, on the argument that the ice sheet margin must then retreat from the coast. Using this criterion, Gregory and Huybrechts  estimated that the SMB threshold occurs for a GMST increase of 3.1  C  C for Greenland surface temperature) above pre-industrial . More recent studies have found thresholds below or in the lower part of this range. In a coupled ice sheet-climate model of intermediate complexity, Huybrechts et al.  found this threshold at 2.5C for annual average Greenland SAT. Comparing three regional climate models, Rae et al.  found a strong dependence of the threshold on the model formulation of the SMB. Based on the model's performance against observations and the 1169	0
physical detail of its surface scheme, MAR is considered the most realistic model, and yields a threshold value 2.8  C for changes in Greenland annual average temperature compared to pre-industrial. Using MAR driven with output from various CMIP5 AOGCMs, Fettweis et al.  evaluated the threshold as ~3C in GMST above 1980- 1999 , and found that it is not exceeded in the 21st century under the RCP4.5 scenario but is reached around 2070 under the RCP8.5 scenario. Some of the uncertainty in the threshold results from the value assumed for the steady state ice-sheet SMB , and whether this is assumed to be pre-industrial or a more recent period. For 400 Gt yr-1 , the parametrization of Greenland ice sheet SMB used for present assessment of 21st century changes  gives a global warming threshold of 3.0  C with respect to 1860-1879 ; for 225 Gt yr-1 , the threshold is 2.1  C. Although a negative SMB is a sufficient condition for passing the threshold, it will overestimate the value of the threshold quantitatively, because the SMB-height feedback  means that the steady-state SMB is reduced by more than is calculated assuming fixed topography. The actual SMB change will depend on the dynamical response of the ice sheet that determines its topography. Constraining simulations with a dynamic ice-sheet model to changes during the last interglacial, Robinson et al.  estimated the threshold as 1.6  C global averaged temperature above pre-industrial. In these simulations, they find that the threshold is passed when southeastern Greenland has a negative SMB. The near-complete ice loss then occurs through ice flow and SMB.	0
The complete loss of the ice sheet is not inevitable because it has a long time scale . If the surrounding temperatures decline before the ice sheet is eliminated, the ice sheet might regrow. In the context of future GHG emissions, the time scale of ice loss is competing with the time scale of temperature decline after a reduction of GHG emissions . The outcome therefore depends on both the CO2 concentration and on how long it is sustained. Charbit et al.  found that loss of the ice sheet is inevitable for cumulative emissions above about 3000 GtC, but a partial loss followed by regrowth occurs for cumulative emissions less than 2500 GtC. Ridley et al.  identified three steady states of the ice sheet. If the CO2 concentration is returned to pre-industrial when more than 20 to 40% of the ice sheet has been lost, it will regrow only to 80% of its original volume due to a local climate feedback in one region; if 50% or more, it regrows to 20 to 40% of the original. Similar states with ice volume around 20%, 60 to 80% and 100% of the initial ice volume are also found in other models . If all the ice is lost, temperatures must decline to below a critical threshold for regrowth of the ice sheet . On the evidence of paleo data and modelling , it is likely that during the LIG, when global mean temperature never 1170	0
exceeded 2oC pre-industrial, the Greenland ice sheet contributed no more than ~4 m to GMSL. This could indicate that the threshold for near-complete deglaciation had not been passed, or that it was not greatly exceeded so that the rate of mass loss was low; however, the forcing responsible for the LIG warming was orbital rather than from CO2 , so it is not a direct analogue and the applicable threshold may be different. Studies with fixed-topography ice sheets indicate a threshold of 2C or above of global warming with respect to pre-industrial for near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet, while the one study  presently available with a dynamical ice sheet suggests that the threshold could be as low as about 1C . Recent studies with fixed-topography ice sheets indicate that the threshold is less than about 4C . With currently available information, we do not have sufficient confidence to assign a likely range for the threshold. If the threshold is exceeded temporarily, an irreversible loss of part or most of the Greenland ice sheet could result, depending on the duration and amount that the threshold is exceeded.	0
13.4.4.1 Surface Mass Balance Change Because the ice loss from Antarctica due to surface melt and runoff is about 1% of the total mass gain from snowfall, most ice loss occurs through solid ice discharge into the ocean. In the 21st century, ablation is projected to remain small on the Antarctic ice sheet because low surface temperatures inhibit surface melting, except near the coast and on the Antarctic Peninsula, and meltwater and rain continue to freeze in the snowpack . Projections of Antarctic SMB changes over the 21st century thus indicate a negative contribution to sea level because of the projected widespread increase in snowfall associated with warming air temperatures . Several studies  have shown that the precipitation increase is directly linked to atmospheric warming via the increased moisture holding capacity of warmer air, and is therefore larger for scenarios of greater warming. The relationship is exponential, resulting in an increase of SMB as a function of Antarctic SAT change evaluated in various recent studies with high-resolution  models as 3.7% C-1 , 4.8% C-1  and ~7% C-1 . These agree well with the sensitivity of 5.1  1.5% C-1  of CMIP3 AOGCMs . The effect of atmospheric circulation changes on continental-mean SMB is an order of magnitude smaller than the effect of warming, but circulation changes can have a large influence on regional changes in accumulation, particularly near the ice-sheet margins  where increased accumulation may induce additional ice flow across the grounding line . Simulated SMB is strongly and nonlinearly influenced by ocean surface temperature and sea-ice conditions . This dependence means that the biases in the model-control climate may distort the SMB sensitivity to climate change, suggesting that more accurate predictions	0
may be obtained from regional models by using boundary conditions constructed by combining observed present-day climate with projected climate change . There is a tendency for higher resolution models to simulate a stronger future precipitation increase because of better representation of coastal and orographic precipitation processes . For the present assessment of GMSL rise, changes in Antarctic ice-sheet SMB up to 2100 have been computed from global mean SAT change projections derived from the CMIP5 AOGCMs, using the range of sensitivities of precipitation increase to atmospheric warming summarized above, and the ratio of Antarctic to global warming evaluated from CMIP3 AOGCMs by Gregory and Huybrechts  . The results are shown in Table 13.5 and Figures 13.10 and 13.11. The projected change in ice outflow is affected by the SMB because of the influence of topography on ice dynamics . Ozone recovery, through its influence on atmospheric circulation at high southern latitudes , may offset some effects of GHG increase in the 21st century, but Antarctic precipitation is nonetheless projected to increase . Bintanja et al.  suggested that Antarctic warming and precipitation increase may be suppressed in the future by expansion of Antarctic sea ice, promoted by freshening of the surface ocean, caused by basal melting of ice shelves, and they conducted an AOGCM sensitivity test of this hypothesis. We consider these possibilities in Section 13.5.3. Beyond the year 2100, regional climate simulations run at high spatial resolution  but without climate-ice sheet feedbacks included show a net ice gain until the year 2200 . During the 22nd century, the ice gain is equivalent to an average rate of sea level fall of 1.2 mm yr-1 for the A1B scenario and 0.46 mm yr-1 for the E1 scenario. For multi-centennial to multi-millennial projections, feedbacks between the ice sheet and regional climate need to be accounted for. This is currently done using ice-sheet models coupled to climate models of intermediate complexity, which have a significantly lower spatial resolution in the atmospheric component than regional climate models used to assess future SMB within the 21st century. These coarser resolution models capture the increase in snowfall under future warming, but the regional distribution is represented less accurately. Accordingly, there is low confidence in their ability to model spatial melting and accumulation patterns accurately. In contrast, medium confidence can be assigned to the models' projection of total accumulation on Antarctica, as it is controlled by the large-scale moisture transport toward the continent. In idealized scenarios of 1% increase of CO2 yr-1 up to 560 ppm with subsequent stabilization, Vizcaino et al.  and Huybrechts et al.  found an initial increase of ice volume due to additional snowfall during the first 600 years of integration. In both models, the changes in SMB dominate the mass changes during and beyond the first 100 years. After 600 years of integration, Vizcaino et al.  found a mass gain corresponding to a sea level fall of 0.15 m . For the same experiment and the same period, Huybrechts et al.  found a sea level fall of 0.08 m .	0
In a similar experiment but allowing GHG concentrations to reach 1120 ppm CO2 before being stabilized, both models show a net positive sea level contribution after 600 years of integration. Huybrechts et al.  found a weak sea level contribution during the first 500 years of integration followed by a stronger and relatively constant long-term average rate of ~2 mm yr-1 after 1000 years of integration up to a total contribution of ~4 m SLE after 3000 years of integration. Although they found some grounding line retreat due to basal ice-shelf melt, the multi-centennial evolution of the ice sheet is dominated by changes in SMB whereas the solid-ice discharge after an initial increase shows a significant decrease during the scenario. For the same scenario, Vizcaino et al.  found that the initial mass gain is followed by a weak mass loss. After 250 years of integration, the contribution is stronger and relatively constant at a rate of about 3 mm yr-1, corresponding to a net contribution of 1.2 m to global mean sea level rise after 600 years. The same model as in Huybrechts et al. , although with a slightly stronger polar amplification, was applied to the three SRES scenarios used in the AR4  with stabilization in the year 2100 . For the lowest scenario , they found practically no net Antarctic contribution to sea level in the year 3000. Under the medium scenario , the ice sheet contributes 0.26 m, and under the highest scenario , it contributes 0.94 m SLE in the year 3000. These simulations include a negative feedback on the regional climate by ice-sheet melt through which summer temperatures can be significantly reduced over Antarctica . However, due to the coarse resolution and the high polar amplification, there is low confidence in the model's representation of oceanic circulation changes around Antarctica. In both models , the ice sheets are not equilibrated with the surrounding climate after the integration period under the 1120 ppm CO2 forcing. Though GHG concentrations were stabilized after 120 years of integration, the Antarctic ice sheet continues to contribute to sea level rise at a relatively constant rate for another 480 years in Vizcaino et al.  and 2880 years in Huybrechts et al. . This is consistent with a positive sea level contribution from Antarctica during past warmer climates . In summary, both coupled ice sheet-climate models consistently show that for high-emission scenarios, the surface melt increases and leads to an ice loss on multi-centennial time scales. The long time period over which the Antarctic ice sheet continues to lose mass indicates a potential role of the feedback between climate and ice sheet. Consistent with regional climate models for the 21st and 22nd centuries, both coarse-resolution coupled models show a positive SMB change for most of the first 100 years of climate change. Due to the inertia in the climate system, regional temperatures continue to rise after that. Together with enhanced solid ice discharge, this results in mass loss of the ice sheet. The corresponding decline in surface elevation increases the surface temperature and leads to additional ice loss.	0
13.4.4.2 Dynamical Change The Antarctic ice sheet represents the largest potential source of future SLR; the West Antarctic ice sheet alone has the potential to raise sea level by ~4.3 m . The rate at which this reservoir will be depleted and cause sea level to rise, however, is not easily quantifiable. In this section, we focus on dynamical changes  that affect SLR by altering the flux of ice across the grounding line  that separates ice resting on bedrock  from floating ice shelves  . Issues associated with the inability of models to reproduce recently observed changes in the dynamics of the Antarctic ice sheet prevented the AR4 from quantifying the effect of these changes on future sea level. Since the AR4, progress has been made in understanding the observations , and projections are becoming available. It must be stressed, however, that this field has yet to reach the same level of development that exists for modelling many other components of the Earth system. There is an underlying concern that observations presage the onset of large-scale grounding line retreat in what is termed the Marine Ice Sheet Instability , and much of the research assessed here attempts to understand the applicability of this theoretical concept to projected SLR from Antarctica. There are three distinct processes that could link climate change to dynamical change of the Antarctic ice sheet and potentially trigger increased outflow. These may operate directly through the increased potential for melt ponds to form on the upper surface of ice shelves, which may destabilize them, or by increases in submarine melt experienced by ice shelves as a consequence of oceanic warming, which leads to their thinning, as well as indirectly by coupling between SMB and ice flow. Section 4.4.3.2 presents the observational basis on which understanding of these processes is based, while their potential future importance is assessed here. Literature on the two mechanisms directly linked to climate change will be assessed first, followed by their relation to outflow change and lastly SMB coupling.	0
There is strong evidence that regional warming and increased melt water ponding in the Antarctic Peninsula led to the collapse of ice shelves along the length of peninsula , most notably the Larsen B ice shelf . Substantial local warming  would, however, be required before the main Antarctic ice shelves  would become threatened . An assessment of the AR4 AOGCM ensemble under scenario A1B yielded an Antarctic continental-average warming rate of 0.034  0.01C yr-1 , suggesting that the required level of warming may not be approached by the end of the 21st century. Using an intermediate complexity model with scenario A2, Fyke et al.  found that melt starts to reach significant levels over these ice shelves around 2100 to 2300. Barrand et al.  made a process-based assessment of the effect of ice-shelf collapse on outflow from the Antarctic Peninsula, which yields a range of SLR at 2100 between 10 and 20 mm, with a bounding maximum of 40 mm.	0
There is good evidence linking the focus of current Antarctic mass loss in the Amundsen Sea sector of the WAIS   to the presence of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water on the continental shelf . However, it is not possible to determine whether this upwelling was related directly or indirectly to a rise in global mean temperature. Yin et al.  assessed output from 19 AOGCMs under scenario A1B to determine how subsurface temperatures are projected to evolve around the West and East Antarctic ice sheets. They showed decadal-mean warming of 0.4C to 0.7C and 0.4C to 0.9C around West and East Antarctica, respectively  by the end of the 21st century. More detailed regional modelling using scenario A1B illustrates the potential for warm water to invade the ocean cavity underlying the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf in the second half of the 21st century, with an associated 20-fold increase in melt . Based on the limited literature, there is medium confidence that oceanic processes may potentially trigger further dynamical change particularly in the latter part of the 21st century, while there is also medium confidence that atmospheric change will not affect dynamics outside of the Antarctic Peninsula during the 21st century. Several process-based projections of the future evolution of Pine Island Glacier have now been made, and some of the issues that this modelling faced , Durand et al. ) are being resolved . In experiments using an idealized increase in marine melt, Joughin et al.  demonstrated only limited  retreat of the grounding line before a new equilibrium position was established. Gladstone et al.  used a flowline model forced with ocean-model output  to identify two modes of retreat: one similar to that identified by Joughin et al. , and a second characterized by complete collapse from 2150 onwards. More sophisticated ice-flow modelling  suggests grounding line retreat of ~100 km in 50 years . These studies support the theoretical finding of Gudmundsson et al.  that grounding line retreat, if triggered, does not inevitably lead to MISI but may halt if local buttressing from ice rises or channel sidewalls is sufficient. Parizek et al.  used a flowline model to study Thwaites Glacier and found that grounding line retreat is possible only under extreme ocean forcing. It is also thought that considerably less back pressure is exerted by Thwaites' ice shelf in comparison to Pine Island's , which may make it less sensitive to forcing by submarine melt . Based on this literature, there is high confidence that the retreat of Pine Island Glacier  can be characterized by a SLR measured in centimetres by 2100, although there is low confidence in the models' ability to determine the probability or timing of any such retreat. There is also medium confidence  that Thwaites Glacier is probably less prone to undergo ocean-driven grounding line retreat than its neighbour in the 21st century. No process-based modelling is available on which to be base projections of EAIS glaciers currently losing mass, such as Totten and Cook Glaciers. Bindschadler et al.  reported a model inter-comparison exercise on the impact of climate change under RCP8.5 on the Antarctic ice	0
sheet. The resultant projection includes contributions from increased marine melt in the Amundsen Sea and Amery sectors, and generated a mean SLR at 2100 of ~100 mm over four models . There is, however, low confidence in the projection because of the unproven ability of many of the contributing models to simulate grounding line motion. Bindschadler et al.  also reported idealized experiments in which ice-shelf melt is increased by 2, 20 and 200 m yr-1. The resulting fivemodel mean SLR of 69, 693 and 3477 mm by 2100, respectively, can be considered only as a general indication because of the shortcomings of the contributing models  which may be offset by the use of a multi-model mean. Although grounding line migration in the 20 m yr-1 experiment is extensive in some models and consistent with what might be expected under MISI , the 200 m yr-1 experiment is unrealistic, even if used as a proxy for the improbable atmosphere-driven collapse of the major ice shelves, and is not considered further. We now assess two alternatives to process-based modelling that exist in the literature: the development of plausible high-end projections based on physical intuition  and the use of a probabilistic framework for extrapolating current observations of the ice sheet's mass budget . Pfeffer et al.  postulated a possible but extreme scenario of 615 mm SLR based on vastly accelerated outflow in the Amundsen Sea sector and East Antarctica, whereas a more plausible scenario involving reduced acceleration in the Amundsen Sea sector yields 136 mm. Katsman et al.  used similar assumptions in a `modest' scenario that generates SLR of 70 to 150 mm, and a `severe' scenario that attempts to capture the consequences of the collapse of the WAIS through the MISI and has a SLR contribution of 490 mm. The NRC  extrapolated mass-budget observations of the ice sheet to generate a projection of 157 to 323 mm , with an additional 77 to 462 mm accounting for 21st-century increases in outflow . Little et al.  applied a range of linear growth rates to present-day SMB and outflow observations of Antarctic sectors , which are then weighted using a continental-scale observational synthesis  . In the case of Pine Island Glacier, growth rates are based on the process-based modelling of Joughin et al. . Within this framework, SLR at 2100 has a 5 to 95% range of -20 to 185 mm for dynamical change only, and -86 to 133 mm when SMB change is included ). Projections for the Antarctic Peninsula are consistent with the process-based modelling of Barrand et al. . Further, Little et al.  found that the upper  limit of the projected range can only approach 400 mm under scenarios expected for MISI . Our assessment of the likely range of SLR is based on the weighted 5-95% range  of Little et al. , which is consistent with the lower scenarios of Katsman et al.   and Pfeffer et al.  , and with the RCP8.5 projection	0
and low-melt experiment of Bindschadler et al.  . The base projection of the NRC  , however, is less compatible. This moderate level of consistency across a range of techniques suggests medium confidence in this assessment. We assess this as the likely  range because it is based primarily on perturbations of the ice sheet's present-day state of mass imbalance and does not include the potentially large increases in outflow that may be associated with the MISI discussed below. The probability of extensive grounding line retreat being both triggered and continuing to the extent that it contributes to significant SLR in the 21st century is very poorly constrained, as the results of a recent expert elicitation indicate . We have medium confidence, however, that this probability lies outside of the likely range of SLR. Five arguments support this assessment. First, the partial loss of Pine Island Glacier is included by Little et al.  in their range and the full loss of the ice stream  is thought to raise sea level by centimetres only  5 to 95% range as the assessed likely range). Second, the current grounding line position of the neighbouring Thwaites Glacier appears to be more stable than that of Pine Island Glacier  so that its potentially large contribution to SLR by 2100 is assessed to have a significantly lower probability. Third, there is a low probability that atmospheric warming in the 21st century will lead to extensive grounding line retreat outside of the Antarctic Peninsula because summer air temperatures will not rise to the level where significant surface melt and ponding occur. Fourth, although this retreat may be triggered by oceanic warming during the 21st century , current literature suggests that this may occur late in the century , reducing the time over which enhanced outflow could affect end-of-century SLR. Finally, there are theoretical grounds to believe that grounding line retreat may stabilize  so that MISI  is not inevitable. We next assess the magnitude of potential SLR at 2100 in the event that MISI affects the Antarctic ice sheet. Bindschadler et al. , Katsman et al. , the NRC , and Pfeffer et al.  presented contrasting approaches that can be used to make this assessment, which are upper-end estimates of 693, 490, 785 and 615 mm, respectively. Together this literature suggests with medium confidence that this contribution would be several tenths of a metre. The literature does not offer a means of assessing the probability of this contribution, however, other than our assessment  that it lies above the likely range. Literature investigating the relation between the SLR generated by dynamical change and emission scenario does not currently exist. There is also a lack of literature on the relation between emission scenario and the intrusions of warm water into ice-shelf cavities thought to be important in triggering observed mass loss  and potentially important in the future . It is therefore premature to attach a scenario dependence to projections of dynamical change, even though such a dependency is expected to exist. Likely increases in snowfall over the next century  will affect the amount of ice lost by outflow across the grounding 1173	0
line because of local changes in ice thickness and stress regime . This effect was incorporated in AR4 projections for 2100 as a compensatory mass loss amounting to 0 to 10% of the SMB mass gain . Winkelmann et al.  re-evaluated the effect and reported a range of 15 to 35% for the next century . The two studies are difficult to compare because of differences in model physics and experimental design so that the use of their joint range  is an appropriate assessment of the likely range of this effect. This range is supported by Barrand et al. , who quantified the effect for the Antarctic Peninsula as ~15% of SMB. Moreover, because this contribution relies on similar physics to the grounding line migration discussed above, it is appropriate to assume that their uncertainties are correlated. Winkelmann et al.  showed that the fractional size of this compensatory effect is independent of scenario. Accounting for this effect equates to SLR of 0 to 32 mm by 2100 based on the SMB range over all emission-scenario projections in Section 13.5.1.1. Beyond the 21st century, only projections with coarse-resolution ice sheet-climate models are available . Confidence in the ability of these two models to capture both change in the oceanic circulation around Antarctica and the response of the ice sheet to these changes, especially a potential grounding line retreat, is low. The model applied by Vizcaino et al.  lacks a dynamic representation of ice shelves. Because dynamic ice discharge from Antarctica occurs predominately through ice shelves, it is likely that the projections using this model considerably underestimate the Antarctic contribution. In summary, it is likely that dynamical change within the Antarctic ice sheet will lead to SLR during the next century with a range of -20 to 185 mm. SLR beyond the likely range is poorly constrained and considerably larger increases are possible , which will probably be associated with the MISI . Although the likelihood of such SLR cannot yet be assessed more precisely than falling above the likely range, literature suggests  that its potential magnitude is several tenths of a metre. We are unable to assess SLR as a function of emission scenario, although a dependency of SLR on scenario is expected to exist. In addition, coupling between SMB and dynamical change is likely to make a further contribution to SLR of 0 to 35% of the SMB. All the available literature suggests that this dynamical contribution to sea level rise will continue well beyond 2100.	0
Due to relatively weak snowfall on Antarctica and the slow ice motion in its interior, it can be expected that the WAIS would take at least several thousand years to regrow if it was eliminated by dynamic ice discharge. Consequently any significant ice loss from West Antarctic that occurs within the next century will be irreversible on a multi-centennial to millennial time scale. We discuss here the possibility of abrupt dynamic ice loss from West Antarctica . Information on the ice and bed topography of WAIS suggests that it has about 3.3 m of equivalent global sea level grounded on areas with 1174	0
downward sloping bedrock . As detailed in Box 13.2, large areas of the WAIS may therefore be subject to potential ice loss via the MISI. As it is the case for other potential instabilities within the climate system , there are four lines of evidence to assess the likelihood of a potential occurrence: theoretical understanding, present-day observations, numerical simulations, and paleo records. The MISI is based on a number of studies that indicated the theoretical existence of the instability  . The most fundamental derivation, that is, starting from a first-principle ice equation, states that in one-dimensional ice flow the grounding line between grounded ice sheet and floating ice shelf cannot be stable on a landward sloping bed. The limitation of the one-dimensional case disregards possible stabilizing effects of the ice shelves . Although it is clear that ice shelves that are laterally constrained by embayments inhibit ice flow into the ocean, the effect has not been quantified against the MISI. The same is true for other potentially stabilizing effects such as sedimentation near the grounding line  or the influence of largescale bedrock roughness  on ice flow. Although these stabilizing effects need to be further investigated and quantified against the destabilizing effect of the MISI, no studies are available that would allow dismissing the MISI on theoretical grounds. Although direct observations of ice dynamics are available, they are neither detailed enough nor cover a sufficiently long period to allow the monitoring of the temporal evolution of an MISI. Most Antarctic ice loss that has been detected during the satellite period has come from the WAIS . Some studies have found an acceleration of ice loss  as well as enhanced basal ice-shelf melting , but the short period of observations does not allow one to either dismiss or confirm that these changes are associated with destabilization of WAIS. Paleo records suggest that WAIS may have deglaciated several times during warm periods of the last 5 million years, but they contain no information on rates . Although coarse-resolution models are in principle capable of modelling the MISI, there is medium confidence in their ability to simulate the correct response time to external perturbations on decadal to centennial time scales . One of these models  reproduced paleo records of deglaciation with a forced ice-sheet model at 40 km resolution and parameterized ice flow across the grounding line according to Schoof . These simulations showed a sea level rise of about 7 m over time spans of 1000 to 7000 years with approximately equal contributions from West and East Antarctica. However, no available model results or paleo records have indicated the possibility of self-accelerated ice discharge from these regions. In summary, ice-dynamics theory, numerical simulations, and paleo records indicate that the existence of a marine-ice sheet instability associated with abrupt and irreversible ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheet is possible in response to climate forcing. However, theoretical considerations, current observations, numerical models, and paleo records currently do not allow a quantification of the timing of the onset of such an instability or of the magnitude of its multi-century contribution.	0
Box 13.2 | History of the Marine Ice-Sheet Instability Hypothesis Marine ice sheets rest on bedrock that is submerged below sea level . The most well-researched marine ice sheet is the West Antarctic ice sheet  where approximately 75% of the ice sheet's area currently rests on bedrock below sea level. The East Antarctic ice sheet , however, also has appreciable areas grounded below sea level , in particular around the Totten and Cook Glaciers. These ice sheets are fringed by floating ice shelves, which are fed by flow from grounded ice across a grounding line . The GL is free to migrate both seawards and landwards as a consequence of the local balance between the weight of ice and displaced ocean water. Depending on a number of factors, which include ice-shelf extent and geometry, ice outflow to the ocean generally  increases with ice thickness at the GL. Accordingly, when the ice sheet rests on a bed that deepens towards the ice-sheet interior , the ice outflow to the ocean will generally increase as the GL retreats. It is this feature that gives rise to the Marine Ice-Sheet Instability , which states that a GL cannot remain stable on a landward-deepening slope. Even if snow accumulation and outflow were initially in balance , natural fluctuations in climate cause the GL to fluctuate slightly . In the case of a retreat, the new GL position is then associated with deeper bedrock and thicker ice, so that outflow increases . This increased outflow leads to further, self-sustaining retreat until a region of shallower, seaward-sloping bedrock is reached. Stable configurations can therefore exist only where the GL rests on slopes that deepen towards the ocean. A change in climate can therefore potentially force a large-scale retreat of the GL from one bedrock ridge to another further inland. 	0
The MISI has a long history based on theoretical discussions that were started by Weertman  and Mercer , and has seen many refinements over the subsequent years. The advent of satellite-based observations has given fresh impetus to this debate, in particular work on the GL retreat and associated thinning of Pine Island , Thwaites  and Smith Glaciers , which are collectively responsible for most of Antarctica's present mass loss . These observations highlighted the need to develop a better understanding of the MISI to make more accurate projections of the ice sheet's future contribution to sea level rise. Early studies of the MISI were not based on a formal derivation from the basic laws of mechanics thought to control ice-sheet flow and the robustness of their results was therefore difficult to assess. An open question was the expected impact of changes at the GL on the ice-sheet flow . Recently, however, a more complete analysis from first principles has been developed that suggests that the fundamental relation between thickness and flux at the GL exists and has a power of ~5  . This analysis, however, does not include ice shelves that occupy laterally constrained embayments, which is often the case . In such situations, drag from ice-shelf sidewalls may suppress the positive feedback between increasing ice thickness and ice flux at the GL . Other factors that could suppress the instability include a sea level fall adjacent to the GL resulting from the isostatic and gravitational effects of ice loss . Two processes that could trigger GL retreat are particularly relevant to contemporary polar climate change. The first is the presence of warmer ocean water under ice shelves, which leads to enhanced submarine ice-shelf melt . The second is the presence of melt water ponds on the surface of the ice shelf, which can cause stress concentrations allowing fractures to penetrate the full ice-shelf thickness. This process appears to have been a primary factor in the collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf  over the course of two months in 2002 . The collapse of the LBIS provided a natural demonstration of the linkage between the structural integrity of an ice shelf and the flow of grounded ice draining into it. Following the breakup of LBIS, the speeds of the glaciers feeding the collapsed portion of the shelf increased two- to eightfold, while the flow of glaciers draining into a surviving sector was unaltered . This indicates that a mechanical link does indeed exist between shelf and sheet, and has important implications for the future evolution of the far more significant PIG and TG systems of the WAIS. The recent strides made in placing MISI on a sound analytical footing are, however, limited to the analysis of steady states. Numerical modelling is needed to simulate the GL retreat rates that are required to make accurate SLR projections. There are major challenges in designing models whose results are not controlled by the details of their numerical design. Problems arise at the GL because, in addition to flotation, basal traction is dramatically reduced as the ice loses contact with the underlying bedrock . This is a topic of active research, and a combination of more complete modelling of the GL stress regime  and the use of high-resolution  models  shows promise towards resolving these problems. Much progress has also been made by using model inter-comparison as a means of understanding these effects .	0
The potential future effects that human activities have on changing water storage on land, thus affecting sea level, have been little studied in the published peer-reviewed scientific literature. For depletion of groundwater arising from extraction , we consider two possibilities. The first assumes that this contribution to GMSL rise continues throughout the 21st century at the rate of 0.40  0.11 mm yr-1  assessed for 2001-2008 by Konikow , amounting to 38  mm by 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005. The second uses results from land surface hydrology models  with input from climate and socioeconomic projections for SRES scenarios, yielding 70  mm for the same time interval. Because of the improved treatment of groundwater recharge by Wada et al. , this is less than R  ahmstorf et al.  obtained by 1176	0
assuming that the groundwater extraction estimates of Wada et al.  can be scaled up in the future with global population. These two possibilities indicate a range of about 20 to 90 mm for the contribution of groundwater depletion to GMSL rise. For the rate of impoundment of water in reservoirs, we evaluate two possibilities. The first assumes it will continue throughout the 21st century  at the average rate of -0.2  0.05 mm yr-1 SLE  estimated for 1971-2010 using data updated from Chao et al. , giving a negative contribution to GMSL rise of -19  mm by 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005. The second assumes it will be zero after 2010 , as shown for the 1990s and 2000s by Lettenmaier and Milly  . A zero contribution implies a balance between further construction of reservoir capacity and reduction of storage volume by sedimentation, each of which could plausibly	0
FAQ 13.2: Will the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets Contribute to Sea Level Change over the Rest of the Century? The Greenland, West and East Antarctic ice sheets are the largest reservoirs of freshwater on the planet. As such, they have contributed to sea level change over geological and recent times. They gain mass through accumulation  and lose it by surface ablation  and outflow at their marine boundaries, either to a floating ice shelf, or directly to the ocean through iceberg calving. Increases in accumulation cause global mean sea level to fall, while increases in surface ablation and outflow cause it to rise. Fluctuations in these mass fluxes depend on a range of processes, both within the ice sheet and without, in the atmosphere and oceans. Over the course of this century, however, sources of mass loss appear set to exceed sources of mass gain, so that a continuing positive contribution to global sea level can be expected. This FAQ summarizes current research on the topic and provides indicative magnitudes for the various end-of-century  sea level contributions from the full assessment, which are reported as the two-in-three probability level across all emission scenarios. Over millennia, the slow horizontal flow of an ice sheet carries mass from areas of net accumulation  to areas of net loss . At present, Greenland loses roughly half of its accumulated ice by surface ablation, and half by calving. Antarctica, on the other hand, loses virtually all its accumulation by calving and submarine melt from its fringing ice shelves. Ice shelves are floating, so their loss has only a negligible direct effect on sea level, although they can affect sea level indirectly by altering the mass budget of their parent ice sheet . In East Antarctica, some studies using satellite radar altimetry suggest that snowfall has increased, but recent atmospheric modelling and satellite measurements of changes in gravity find no significant increase. This apparent disagreement may be because relatively small long-term trends are masked by the strong interannual variability of snowfall. Projections suggest a substantial increase in 21st century Antarctic snowfall, mainly because a warmer atmosphere would be able to carry more moisture into polar regions. Regional changes in atmospheric circulation probably play a secondary role. For the whole of the Antarctic ice sheet, this process is projected to contribute between 0 and 70 mm to sea level fall. Currently, air temperatures around Antarctica are too cold for substantial surface ablation. Field and satellite-based observations, however, indicate enhanced outflow--manifested as ice-surface lowering--in a few localized coastal regions. These areas  all lie within kilometre-deep bedrock troughs towards the edge of Antarctica's continental shelf. The increase in outflow is thought to have been triggered by regional changes in ocean circulation, bringing warmer water in contact with floating ice shelves. On the more northerly Antarctic Peninsula, there is a well-documented record of ice-shelf collapse, which appears to be related to the increased surface melting caused by atmospheric warming over recent decades. The subsequent thinning of glaciers draining into these ice shelves has had a positive--but minor--effect on sea level, as will any further such events on the Peninsula. Regional projections of 21st century atmospheric temperature change suggest that this process will probably not affect the stability of the large ice shelves of both the West and East Antarctica, although these ice shelves may be threatened by future oceanic change . Estimates of the contribution of the Antarctic ice sheets to sea level over the last few decades vary widely, but great strides have recently been made in reconciling the observations. There are strong indications that enhanced outflow  currently outweighs any increase in snow accumulation , implying a tendency towards sea level rise. Before reliable projections of outflow over the 21st century can be made with greater confidence, models that simulate ice flow need to be improved, especially of any changes in the grounding line that separates floating ice from that resting on bedrock and of interactions between ice shelves and the ocean. The concept of `marine ice-sheet instability' is based on the idea that the outflow from an ice sheet resting on bedrock below sea level increases if ice at the grounding line is thicker and, therefore, faster flowing. On bedrock that slopes downward towards the ice-sheet interior, this creates a vicious cycle of increased outflow, causing ice at the grounding line to thin and go afloat. The grounding line then retreats down slope into thicker ice that, in turn, drives further increases in outflow. This feedback could potentially result in the rapid loss of parts of the ice sheet, as grounding lines retreat along troughs and basins that deepen towards the ice sheet's interior.	0
Future climate forcing could trigger such an unstable collapse, which may then continue independently of climate. This potential collapse might unfold over centuries for individual bedrock troughs in West Antarctica and sectors of East Antarctica. Much research is focussed on understanding how important this theoretical concept is for those ice sheets. Sea level could rise if the effects of marine instability become important, but there is not enough evidence at present to unambiguously identify the precursor of such an unstable retreat. Change in outflow is projected to contribute between -20  and 185 mm to sea level rise by year 2100, although the uncertain impact of marine ice-sheet instability could increase this figure by several tenths of a metre. Overall, increased snowfall seems set to only partially offset sea level rise caused by increased outflow. In Greenland, mass loss through more surface ablation and outflow dominates a possible recent trend towards increased accumulation in the interior. Estimated mass loss due to surface ablation has doubled since the early 1990s. This trend is expected to continue over the next century as more of the ice sheet experiences surface ablation for longer periods. Indeed, projections for the 21st century suggest that increasing mass loss will dominate over weakly increasing accumulation. The refreezing of melt water within the snow pack high up on the ice sheet offers an important  dampening effect on the relation between atmospheric warming and mass loss. Although the observed response of outlet glaciers is both complex and highly variable, iceberg calving from many of Greenland's major outlet glaciers has increased substantially over the last decade, and constitutes an appreciable additional mass loss. This seems to be related to the intrusion of warm water into the coastal seas around Greenland, but it is not clear whether this phenomenon is related to inter-decadal variability, such as the North Atlantic 	0
FAQ 13.2, Figure 1 | Illustrative synthesis of projected changes in SMB and outflow by 2100 for  Greenland and  Antarctic ice sheets. Colours shown on the maps refer to projected SMB change between the start and end of the 21st century using the RACMO2 regional atmospheric climate model under future warming scenarios A1B  and RCP4.5 . For Greenland, average equilibrium line locations during both these time periods are shown in purple and green, respectively. Ice-sheet margins and grounding lines are shown as black lines, as are ice-sheet sectors. For Greenland, results of flowline modelling for four major outlet glaciers are shown as inserts, while for Antarctica the coloured rings reflect projected change in outflow based on a probabilistic extrapolation of observed trends. The outer and inner radius of each ring indicate the upper and lower bounds of the two-thirds probability range of the contribution, respectively ; red refers to mass loss  while blue refers to mass gain . Finally, the sea level contribution is shown for each ice sheet  with light grey referring to SMB  and dark grey to outflow. All projections refer to the two-in-three probability range across all scenarios.	0
Oscillation, or a longer term trend associated with greenhouse gas-induced warming. Projecting its effect on 21st century outflow is therefore difficult, but it does highlight the apparent sensitivity of outflow to ocean warming. The effects of more surface melt water on the lubrication of the ice sheet's bed, and the ability of warmer ice to deform more easily, may lead to greater rates of flow, but the link to recent increases in outflow is unclear. Change in the net difference between surface ablation and accumulation is projected to contribute between 10 and 160 mm to sea level rise in 2081-2100 , while increased outflow is projected to contribute a further 10 to 70 mm . The Greenland ice sheet has contributed to a rise in global mean sea level over the last few decades, and this trend is expected to increase during this century. Unlike Antarctica, Greenland has no known large-scale instabilities that might generate an abrupt increase in sea level rise over the 21st century. A threshold may exist, however, so that continued shrinkage might become irreversible over multi-centennial time scales, even if the climate were to return to a pre-industrial state over centennial time scales. Although mass loss through the calving of icebergs may increase in future decades, this process will eventually end when the ice margin retreats onto bedrock above sea level where the bulk of the ice sheet resides.	0
have a rate of about 1% yr-1 of existing capacity . These two possibilities together indicate a range of about 0 to 30 mm of GMSL fall for the contribution of reservoir impoundment. Our assessment thus leads to a range of -10 to +90 mm for the net contribution to GMSL rise from anthropogenic intervention in land water storage by 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005. This range includes the range of 0 to 40 mm assumed by Katsman et al. . Because of the limited information available, we do not have sufficient confidence to give ranges for individual RCP scenarios.	0
using parameterizations derived from the results of process-based models of these components  . According to the assessment in Section 12.4.1.2, global mean SAT change is likely to lie within the 5 to 95% range of the projections of CMIP5 models. Following this assessment, the 5 to 95% range of model results for each of the GMSL rise contributions that is projected on the basis of CMIP5 results is interpreted as the likely range. Possible ice-sheet dynamical changes by 2100 are assessed from the published literature , which as yet provides only a partial basis for making projections related to particular scenarios. They are thus treated as independent of scenario, except that a higher rate of change is used for Greenland ice sheet outflow under RCP8.5. Projections of changes in land water storage due to human intervention are also treated as independent of emissions scenario, because we do not have sufficient information to give ranges for individual scenarios. The scenario-independent treatment does not imply that the contributions concerned will not depend on the scenario followed, only that the current state of knowledge does not permit a quantitative assessment of the dependence. For each of these contributions, our assessment of the literature provides a 5-95% range for the late 21st century . For consistency with the treatment of the CMIP5-derived results, we interpret this range as the likely range. We assume that each of these contributions begins from its present-day rate and that the rate increases linearly in time, in order to interpolate from the present day to the late 21st century . The likely range of GMSL rise given for each RCP combines the uncertainty in global climate change, represented by the CMIP5 ensemble , with the uncertainties in modelling the c ontributions to GMSL. The part of the uncertainty related to the magnitude of global 1179	0
climate change is correlated among all the scenario-dependent contributions, while the methodological uncertainties are treated as independent . The sum of the projected contributions gives the likely range for future GMSL rise. The median projections for GMSL in all scenarios lie within a range of 0.05 m until the middle of the century , because the divergence of the climate projections has a delayed effect owing to the time-integrating characteristic of sea level.

RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 are very similar at the end of the century  m and 0.48 ] m respectively), but RCP4.5 has a greater rate of rise earlier in the century than RCP6.0 . At 2100, the likely ranges are 0.44  m , 0.53  m , 0.55  m , and 0.74  m . In all scenarios, the rate of rise at the start of the RCP projections  is about 3.7 mm yr-1, slightly above the observational range of 3.2  mm yr-1 for 1993-2010, because the modelled contributions for recent years, although consistent with observations for 1993-2010 , are all in the upper part of the observa-	0
In all scenarios, thermal expansion is the largest contribution, accounting for about 30 to 55% of the projections. Glaciers are the next largest, accounting for 15-35% of the projections. By 2100, 15 to 55% of the present volume of glaciers outside Antarctica is projected to be eliminated under RCP2.6, and 35 to 85% under RCP8.5 . SMB change on the Greenland ice sheet makes a positive contribution, whereas SMB change in Antarctica gives a negative contribution . The positive contribution due to rapid dynamical changes that result in increased ice outflow from both ice sheets together has a likely range of 0.03 to 0.20 m in RCP8.5 and 0.03 to 0.19 m in the other RCPs. There is a relatively small positive contribution from human intervention in land water storage, predominantly due to increasing extraction of groundwater.	0

See Section 13.5.1 concerning how the likely range is defined. Because some of the uncertainties in modelling the contributions are treated as uncorrelated, the sum of the lower bound of contributions does not equal the lower bound of the sum, and similarly for the upper bound . Because of imprecision from rounding, the sum of the medians of contributions may not exactly equal the median of the sum. The net contribution  + dynamics) for each ice sheet, and the contribution from rapid dynamical change in both ice sheets together, are shown as additional lines below the sum; they are not contributions in addition to those given above the sum. The contributions from ice-sheet rapid dynamical change and anthropogenic land water storage are treated as having uniform probability distributions, uncorrelated with the magnitude of global climate change , and as independent of scenario . This treatment does not imply that the contributions concerned will not depend on the scenario followed, only that the current state of knowledge does not permit a quantitative assessment of the dependence. Regional sea level change is expected in general to differ from the global mean .	0
The development of semi-empirical models  was motivated by two problems. First, process-based modelling was incomplete in the AR4 because of the unavailability of ice-sheet dynamical models which could be used to simulate the observed recent accelerations in ice flow and make projections with confidence  . Second, in all previous IPCC assessments, observed GMSL rise during the 20th century could not be completely accounted for by the contributions to GMSL from thermal expansion, glaciers and ice sheets. For example, the AR4 assessed the mean observational rate for 1961-2003 as 1.8  0.5 mm yr-1, and the sum of contributions as 1.1  0.5 mm yr-1 . With the central estimates, only about 60% of observed sea level rise was thus explained, and the potential implication was that projections using process-based models which reproduce only those known contributions would underestimate future sea level rise . SEMs do not aim to solve the two problems that motivated their development, but instead provide an alternative approach for projecting GMSL. 1182	0
The semi-empirical approach regards a change in sea level as an integrated response of the entire climate system, reflecting changes in the dynamics and thermodynamics of the atmosphere, ocean and cryosphere; it does not explicitly attribute sea level rise to its individual physical components. SEMs use simple physically motivated relationships, with various analytical formulations and parameters determined from observational time series, to predict GMSL for the 21st century  and beyond, from either global mean SAT  or RF . SEMs are designed to reproduce the observed sea level record over their period of calibration, as this provides them with model parameters needed to make projections . A test of the predictive skill of the models requires simulating a part of the observed record that has not been used for calibration. For instance, Rahmstorf  calibrated for 1880-1940 and predicted 1940-2000, obtaining results within 0.02 m of observed. Jevrejeva et al.  calibrated	0

up to 1950 and predicted 0.03 m  less than observed for 1950-2009, and 3.8 mm yr-1 for 1993-2010, which is about 20% more than observed. The GMSL estimates used for calibrating the SEMs are based on the existing sparse network of long tide-gauge records, and are thus uncertain, especially before the late 19th century; these uncertainties are reflected in the observational estimates of the rate of GMSL rise . Consequently, the projections may be sensitive to the statistical treatment of the temporal variability in the instrumental record of sea level change . Rahmstorf et al.  reported that GMSL projections for the RCP4.5 scenario for 2100  varied by 0.04 m when the embedding dimension used for temporal smoothing during the calibration was varied within a range of 0 to 25 years. Furthermore, there is some sensitivity to the choice of data sets used for calibration. For instance, when calibrated up to 1960 and used	0
to predict 1961-2003, the model of Bittermann et al.  overestimates the GMSL data set of Jevrejeva et al.  by 75%, but makes an accurate estimate for the Church and White  data set, although these two data sets have similar rates of sea level rise in the predicted period. The central projections of Rahmstorf et al.  for 2100 under RCP4.5  for calibration with the GMSL data set of Church and White  are about 0.2 m more than for calibration with the Church and White  data set, although the two Church and White  data sets differ at all times by less than one standard deviation. The ranges of the projections by Grinsted et al.  and Jevrejeva et al.  allow for the uncertainty in the GMSL reconstructions through the use of an uncertainty covariance matrix in determining the model parameters. Grinsted et al.  also investigated the sensitivity to the temperature data set used as predictor, and Jevrejeva et al.  investigated the sensitivity to RF as predictor . In the latter case, three data sets gave median projections under RCP4.5 for 2100 within a range of about 0.20 m. SEM projections will be biased unless contributions to past GMSL rise which correlate with but are not physically related to contemporary changes in the predictor variable  are subtracted from the observational sea level record before the calibration . These include groundwater depletion due to anthropogenic intervention and storage of water by dams , ongoing adjustment of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to climate change in previous centuries and millennia , and the effects of internally generated regional climate variability on glaciers  and ice sheets . For instance, Jevrejeva et al.  found that their median projections for 2100 were reduced by 0.02 to 0.10 m by excluding some such contributions. Making projections with a SEM assumes that sea level change in the future will have the same relationship as it has had in the past to RF or global mean temperature change. The appropriate choice for the formulation of the SEM may depend on the nature of the climate forcing and the time scale, and potentially nonlinear physical processes may not scale in the future in ways which can be calibrated from the past . Two such effects that could lead to overestimated or underestimated projections by SEMs have been discussed in the literature. First, AOGCMs indicate that the ocean heat uptake efficiency tends to decline as warming continues and heat penetrates more deeply . A linear scaling of the rate of global ocean heat uptake with global SAT determined from the past, as proposed by Rahmstorf , will thus overestimate future time-integrated heat content change and the consequent global ocean thermal expansion on a century time scale . Rahmstorf  found that the linear scaling overestimated by 0.12 m  the thermal expansion simulated by a climate model with a 3D ocean from 1990 to 2100 under scenario SRES A1FI. Furthermore, the Rahmstorf  model is inadequate for simulating sea level variations of the 1183	0
u nderstanding at the time was not sufficient to allow an assessment of the possibility of future rapid changes in ice-sheet dynamics . Future rapid changes in icesheet outflow were consequently not included in the ranges given by the AR4. For the SRES A1B scenario, the AR4 range was 0.21 to 0.48 m, and for the highest emissions scenario, A1FI, it was 0.26 to 0.59 m. The AR4 also noted that if ice-sheet outflow increased linearly with global mean surface air temperature, the AR4 maximum projections would be raised by 0.1 to 0.2 m. The AR4 was unable to exclude larger values or to assess their likelihood. Since the publication of the AR4, upper bounds of up to 2.4 m for GMSL rise by 2100 have been estimated by other approaches, namely SEMs , evidence from past climates  and physical constraints on ice-sheet dynamics . The broad range of values reflects the different methodologies for obtaining the upper bound, involving different constraining factors and sources of evidence. In particular, the upper bound is strongly affected by the choice of probability level, which in some approaches is unknown because the probability of the underlying assumptions is not quantified . The confidence that can be placed in projections of GMSL rise and its upper bound by the various approaches must be considered. Confidence arises from the nature, quantity, quality and consistency of the evidence. The first approach is based on process-based projections, which use the results from several models for each contribution . There is medium evidence in support of this approach, arising from our understanding of the modelled physical processes, the consistency of the models with wider physical understanding of those processes as elements of the climate system , the consistency of modelled and observed contributions , the consistency of observed and modelled GMSL , and the consistency of process-based projections based on the CMIP5 ensemble of AOGCMs, which have a range of 50 to 60% of the ensemble mean under a given scenario . Considering this evidence, we have medium confidence in the process-based projections. The second approach uses SEMs , which make projections by calibrating a physically motivated relationship between GMSL and some other parameter of the climate system in the past and applying it to the future, without quantifying the contributory physical processes. If we had no physical understanding of the causes of sea level rise, the semi-empirical approach to projections would be the only possible one, but extrapolation beyond the range of calibration implies uncertainty that is difficult to quantify, owing to the assumption that sea level change in the future will have the same relationship as it has had in the past to RF or global mean temperature change . As a result, there is low agreement and no consensus in the scientific community about the reliability of SEM projections, despite their successful calibration and evaluation against the observed 20th century sea level record. For a given RCP, some SEMs project a range that overlaps the processbased likely range while others project a median and 95-percentile	0
that are about twice as large as the process-based models. In nearly every case, the SEM 95-percentile is above the process-based likely range . Two physical explanations have been suggested for the higher projections. First, the contribution from accelerated calving of tidewater glaciers may be substantial and included in SEMs but not process-based models ; however, this could account for only 0.1 to 0.2 m of additional GMSL rise. Second, SEMs may allow for rapid ice-sheet dynamical change  in response to future climate change . In order for large ice-sheet dynamical changes to be predictable by SEMs, two conditions must be met. First, these changes must have contributed substantially to sea level rise during the period of calibration. This is very unlikely to be the case, because it is very likely that dynamical changes have contributed only a small part of the observed sea level rise during the 20th century, rising to about 15% during 1993-2010 . Second, the changes must have a link to global surface temperature or RF. Current understanding of recent dynamical changes in Greenland and Antarctica is that they have been triggered by local changes in ocean temperature , but a link has not been demonstrated between these changes and global climate change or its drivers. Consequently there is great uncertainty regarding whether recent ice-sheet dynamical changes indicate a long-term trend or instead arise from internal variability . Hence there is no evidence that ice-sheet dynamical change is the explanation for the higher GMSL rise projections of SEMs, implying that either there is some other contribution which is presently unidentified or underestimated by process-based models, or that the projections of SEMs are overestimates . Because of the limited or medium evidence supporting SEMs, and the low agreement about their reliability, we have low confidence in their projections. The third approach uses paleo records of sea level change that show that rapid GMSL rise has occurred during glacial terminations, at rates that averaged about 10 mm yr-1 over centuries, with at least one instance  that exceeded 40 mm yr-1 , but this rise was primarily from much larger ice-sheet sources that no longer exist. Contributions from these vanished ice sheets could have continued even after sea level and climate had reached interglacial states, if the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets contracted during the termination to smaller sizes than at present. During past interglacial periods, only the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets were present. For the time interval during the LIG in which GMSL was above present, there is high confidence that the maximum 1000-year average rate of GMSL rise during these periods exceeded 2 m kyr-1 but did not exceed 7 m kyr-1  . Because climate variations during interglacial periods had different forcings from anthropogenic climate change, they give only a limited basis for predictions of the future, and we do not consider that they provide upper bounds for GMSL rise during the 21st century. The fourth approach is concerned particularly with the contribution from ice-sheet dynamical change, for which it considers kinematic limits. Pfeffer et al.  argued that scenarios of GMSL rise exceeding 2 m by 2100 are physically untenable, ruling out, for example, the heuristic argument of Hansen et al.  giving 5 m by 2100. Pfeffer et al.  constructed scenarios of 0.8 m and 2.0 m, and Katsman 1185	0
et al.  of 1.15 m, for GMSL rise by 2100, including ice-sheet rapid dynamical acceleration. Although these authors considered their scenarios to be physically possible, they are unable to quantify their likelihood, because the probability of the assumptions on which they depend cannot be estimated from observations of the response of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to climate change or variability on century time scales. These scenarios involve contributions of ~0.5 m from Antarctica. This is much greater than any process-based projections of dynamical ice-sheet change , and would require either a sustained high increase in outflow in all marine-based sectors or the localized collapse of the ice sheet in the Amundsen Sea sector . In summary, we have greater confidence in the process-based projections than in the other approaches, and our assessment is that GMSL rise during the 21st century for each RCP scenario is likely  to lie within the 5 to 95% range given by the processbased projections , which are consistent with the likely ranges projected for global mean surface air temperature change . We are not able to assess a very likely range on the same basis, because there is no assessment available of the very likely range for global mean SAT change, and because we cannot robustly quantify the probability of ice-sheet dynamical changes which would give rise to greater values. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, which has the highest RF, the likely range reaches 0.98 m by 2100 relative to 1986-2005. Observations do not show an increase in Antarctic precipitation, which is projected by models and makes a negative contribution to the projected GMSL rise . The recovery of Antarctic stratospheric ozone concentration and increased basal melting of Antarctic ice shelves have both been suggested as giving rise to mechanisms whereby the Antarctic warming and precipitation increase might be suppressed with respect to CMIP5 projections . If the Antarctic precipitation increase is omitted from the process-based projections, the likely range for RCP8.5 at 2100 reaches 1.03 m . Higher values for 2100 are given in the scientific literature on the basis of various approaches: 1.15 m , 1.21 m  , 1.40 m , 1.65 m  , 1.79 m  , 1.90 m  , 2.0 m , 2.25 m , and 2.4 m . Considering this inconsistent evidence, we conclude that the probability of specific levels above the likely range cannot be reliably evaluated.	0
The time mean rate of GMSL rise during the 21st century is very likely to exceed the rate of 2.0  mm yr-1 observed during 1971-2010, because the process-based GMSL projections indicate a significantly greater rate even under the RCP2.6 scenario, which has the lowest RF. It has been asserted that the acceleration of GMSL rise implied by the IPCC AR4 projections is inconsistent with the observed magnitude of acceleration during the 20th century . Refuting this argument, Hunter and Brown  show that the acceleration projected in the AR4 is consistent with observations since 1990s. Present understanding of the contributions to GMSL rise  gives an explanation of the rate of 20th century GMSL rise and confidence in the process-based projections, which indicate a greater rate of rise in the 21st century because of increasing forcing. The improved agreement of process-based models with observations and physical understanding represents progress since the AR4, in which there was insufficient confidence to give likely ranges for 21st century GMSL rise, as we have done here. For scenario SRES A1B, which was assessed in the AR4, the likely range on the basis of science assessed in the AR5 is 0.60  m by 2100 relative to 1986-2005, and 0.57  m by 2090-2099 relative to 1990. Compared with the AR4 projection of 0.21 to 0.48 m for the same scenario and period, the largest increase is from the inclusion of rapid changes in Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet outflow, for which the combined likely range is 0.03 to 0.21 m by 2091-2100 . These terms were omitted in the AR4 because a basis to make projections was not available in published literature at that time. The contribution from thermal expansion is similar to the AR4 projection and has smaller uncertainty. The contribution from glaciers is larger than in the AR4 primarily because of the greater estimate of the present glacier volume in new inventories , and the Greenland SMB contribution is larger because of recent improvement in models of relevant surface processes. Further progress on modelling each of the contributions is still needed in order to attain high confidence in GMSL projections, in particular concerning the probability distribution of GMSL above the likely ranges.	0
Less information is available on climate change beyond the year 2100 than there is up to the year 2100. However, the ocean and ice sheets will continue to respond to changes in external forcing on multi-centennial to multi-millennial time scales. For the period up to the year 2500, available physical model projections discussed in Sections 13.4.1-4 are combined into an assessment of future sea level rise. Paleo simulations are combined with paleo data to estimate the sea level commitment on a multi-millennial time scale beyond 2500 for different levels of sustained increases in global mean temperature. The RCPs, as applied in Chapter 12 and Sections 13.4 and 13.5.1, are defined up to the year 2100. Their extension up to the year 2300 is used to project long-term climate change  , but they are not directly derived from integrated assessment models. In simulations that are reported here up to the year 2500, the RF has generally been kept constant at the 2300 level	0
except for RCP2.6, in which the forcing continues to decline at the 2300 rate. Some model simulations of ice sheets and ocean warming assessed here have used scenarios different from the RCP scenarios. Because of the limited number of available simulations, sea level projections beyond the year 2100 have thus been grouped into three categories according to their GHG concentration in the 22nd century: low scenarios in which atmospheric GHG concentrations peak and decline and do not exceed values that are equivalent to 500 ppm CO2, medium scenarios with concentrations between 500 and 700 ppm CO2-eq, and high scenarios above 700 ppm. As a consequence, the model spread shown in Figure 13.13 and Table 13.8 combines different scenarios and is not merely due to different model physics. The low scenarios include RCP2.6, SRES B1 and scenarios with 0.5 and 2% yr-1 increases in CO2 followed by no emissions after 450 ppm has been reached, and the commitment scenarios, CC, in Goelzer et al.  which stabilize CO2 at present-day levels. In a number of the low scenarios, the global mean temperature peaks during the 21st century and declines thereafter. These peak-and-decline scenarios include RCP2.6 as well as all scenarios with no GHG emissions after a specified year. Even in these scenarios sea level continues to rise up to the year 2500 in accordance with the multi-millennial sea level commitment of about 2 m C-1 as discussed in Section 13.5.4.2. The medium scenarios include RCP4.5 as well as scenarios with 1% yr-1 increase in CO2 up to 560 ppm and SRES-B1 and SRES-A1B. The high scenarios include RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 as well as 1120 ppm scenarios and SRES A2. Also included are scenarios with 0.5 and 2% increase in CO2 and a SRES A2 scenario with zero emissions after 1200 and 1120 ppm have been reached, respectively.	0
13.5.4.1 Multi-centennial Projections The multi-centennial sea level contributions from ocean expansion and the cryospheric components are discussed in Sections 13.4.1 to 13.4.4. A synthesis of these contributions is provided in Table 13.8 and Figure 13.13 for the end of each century until the year 2500. Thermal expansion contributions  were obtained from coarse-resolution coupled climate models . For comparison, the full model spread of the CMIP5 models which were integrated beyond 2100 is provided in Table 13.7 and as light blue bars in Figure 13.13. Even though the models used for the long-term projections  are less complex compared to the CMIP5 models, their model spread for the different periods and scenarios encompasses the CMIP5 spread, which provides medium confidence in the application of the less complex models beyond 2300. Contributions from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets were obtained with climate models of comparable complexity coupled to ice-sheet models . Glacier projections were obtained by application of the method by Marzeion et al.  to the CMIP5 model output for scenarios and models that were integrated up to the year 2300. For 2400 and 2500, the same model spread as for 2300 is shown. This is probably underestimating the glacier's sea level contribution beyond 2300. The ranges of sea level contributions provided in Figure 13.13 and Table 13.8 only represent the model spread and cannot be interpreted as uncertainty ranges. An uncertainty assessment cannot be provid-	0
ed beyond the year 2100 because of the small number of available simulations, the fact that different scenarios were combined within one scenario group, and the overall low confidence in the ability of the coarse-resolution ice-sheet models to capture the dynamic ice discharge from Greenland and Antarctica, as discussed below. The range for the total sea level change was obtained by taking the sum of contributions that result in the lowest and the highest sea level rise and thereby covers the largest possible model spread. Except for the glacier models , the models used here for the period beyond 2100 are different from the models used for the 21st century . Generally, the model spread for the total sea level contribution in 2100 is slightly lower than the likely range provided in Section 13.5.1 . This is due to the ice-sheet models, particularly of the Antarctic ice sheet, as coarse-resolution model results for thermal expansion cover the range of the CMIP5 projections  and the glacier contribution is the same. Projections beyond 2100 show positive contributions to sea level from thermal expansion, glaciers and changes in Greenland ice sheet SMB. Due to enhanced accumulation under warming, the Antarctic ice sheet SMB change makes a negative contribution to sea level in scenarios below 700 ppm CO2-eq. These results were obtained with fully coupled climate-ice sheet models which need to apply a relatively low spatial resolution. In light of the discussion in Section 13.3.3.2 and the assessment of the 21st century changes in Section 13.4.4.1, there is low confidence in this result. For scenarios above 700 ppm CO2-eq, Antarctic SMB change is contributing positively to GMSL. As discussed in Sections 13.4.3.2 and 13.4.4.2, there is medium confidence in the ability of coupled ice sheet-climate models to project sea level contributions from dynamic ice-sheet changes in Greenland and Antarctica for the 21st century. In Greenland, dynamic mass loss is limited by topographically defined outlets regions. Furthermore, solid ice discharge induced from interaction with the ocean is self-limiting because retreat of the ice sheet results in less contact with the ocean and less mass loss by iceberg calving . By contrast, the bedrock topography of Antarctica is such that parts of the retreating ice sheet will remain in contact with the ocean. In particular, due to topography that is sloping landward, especially in West Antarctica, enhanced rates of mass loss are expected as the ice retreats. Although the model used by Huybrechts et al.  is in principle capable of capturing grounding line motion of marine ice sheets , low confidence is assigned to the model's ability to capture the associated time scale and the perturbation required to initiate a retreat . The model used by Vizcaino et al.  does not represent ice-shelf dynamics and is thus lacking a fundamental process that can trigger the instability. As stated by the authors, low confidence is thus also assigned to the model's ability to project future solid ice discharge from Antarctica. It is thus likely that the values depicted in Figure 13.13 systematically underestimate Antarctica's future contribution. As detailed in Section 13.5.4.2, simulations of the last 5 Myr  indicate that on 1187	0

 ulti-millennial time scales, the Antarctic ice sheet loses mass for elem vated temperatures, in contrast to the projections until the year 2500 for the low and medium scenarios. The model spread of total sea level change in 2300 ranges from 0.41 to 0.85 m for the low scenario . Using an SEM, Schaeffer et al.  obtained a significantly larger 90% confidence range of 1.3 to 3.3 m for the RCP2.6 scenario. The RCP4.5 scenario, for which they obtained a range of 2.3 to 5.5 m, is categorized here as a medium scenario, and is also significantly higher than the range 1188	0
of 0.27 to 1.51 m computed by the process-based models. Using a different s emi-empirical approach, Jevrejeva et al.  obtained a 90% confidence range of 0.13 to 1.74 m for RCP2.6 in the year 2500, which encloses the model spread of 0.50 to 1.02 m for the low scenario from the process-based models. For the medium and high scenarios, however, they obtained ranges of 0.72 to 4.3 m and 1.0 to 11.5 m, respectively, which are significantly higher than the corresponding process-based model spread of 0.18 to 2.32 m and 1.51 to 6.63 m . Because projections of land water storage are not available for years beyond 2100 these were not included here.	0
The higher estimates from the SEMs than the process-based models used here for the long-term projections are consistent with the relation between the two modelling approaches for the 21st century . Section 13.5.3 concluded that the limited or medium evidence supporting SEMs, and the low agreement about their reliability, provides low confidence in their projections for the 21st century. We note here that the confidence in the ability of SEMs is further reduced with the length of the extrapolation period and the deviation of the future forcing from the forcing of the learning period , thus decreasing confidence over the long time frames considered here.	0
The Antarctic ice sheet contribution comes from a simulation of the last 5 million years , which is in good agreement with regional paleo records . The sensitivity of the ice sheet was extracted from this model simulation by correlating the ice volume with the global mean temperature which forces the simulation. The standard deviation of the resulting scatter is used as a measure of uncertainty . Uncertainty arises from uncertainty in the forcing data, the ice physics representation, and from the time-dependent nature of the simulation. For example, the existence of hysteresis behavior on the sub-continental scale can lead to different contributions for the same temperature increase. The Antarctic ice sheet shows a relatively constant commitment of 1.2 m C-1. Paleorecords indicate that a potential hysteresis behaviour of East Antarctica requires a temperature increase above 4C and is thereby outside of the scope discussed here .	0
13.5.4.2 Multi-Millennial Projections Here sea level commitment in response to a global mean temperature increase on a multi-millennial time scale is assessed. Figure 13.14 shows the sea level rise after several millennia of constant global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial. The thermal expansion of the ocean was taken from 1000-year integrations with six coupled climate models as used in the AR4 , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , MoBidiC, and Loch-Vecode-Ecbilt-CLio-agIsm Model  in Figure 10.34 in Meehl et al. ). These yield a rate of sea level change in the range of 0.20 to 0.63 m C-1 . For reference, a spatially uniform increase of ocean temperature yields a global mean sea level rise of 0.38 m C-1 when added to observed data  . Uncertainty arises due to the different spatial distribution of the warming in models and the dependence of the expansion on local temperature and salinity. The contribution for glaciers was obtained with the models from Mazeion et al.  and Radic and Hock  by integration with fixed boundary conditions corresponding to different global mean SAT levels for 3000 years. As detailed in Sections 13.4.3.2 and 13.4.4.2, there is low confidence in the ability of current Antarctic ice-sheet models to capture the temporal response to changes in external forcing on a decadal to centennial time scale. On multi-centennial to multi-millennial time scales, however, these models can be validated against paleo sea level records. The contributions from the Greenland ice sheet were computed with a dynamic ice-sheet model coupled to an energy-moisture balance model for the SMB . The model's parameters were constrained by comparison with SMB estimates and topographic data for the present day and with estimated summit-elevation changes from ice-core records for the Last Interglacial period , in order to ensure that the coupled model ensemble has a realistic sensitivity to climatic change. The parameter spread leads to a spread in ice-sheet responses . The contribution to sea level commitment from the Greenland ice sheet is relatively weak (on average 0.18 m C-1	0
In order to compare the model results with past sea level anomalies for the temperature range up to 4C, we focus on the three previous periods of warmer climates and higher sea levels than pre-industrial that were assessed in Sections 5.6.1, 5.6.2 and 13.2.1: the middle Pliocene, MIS 11, and the LIG . In each case, there is reasonable agreement between the model result of a long-term sea level response for a given temperature with the information from the paleo record. The ability of the physical models to reproduce paleo sea level records on a multi-millennial time scale provides confidence in applying them to millennial time frames. After 2000 years, the sea level contribution will be largely independent of the exact warming path during the first century. As can be seen from Figure 10.34 of AR4, the oceanic heat content will be largely equilibrated after 2000 years; the same is true for the glacier component. The situation for Antarctica is slightly more complicated, but as can be inferred from Pollard and DeConto , much of the retreat of the West Antarctic ice sheet will have already occurred by 2000 years, especially if the warming occurs on a decadal to centennial time scale. The opposite and smaller trend in East Antarctic ice volume due to increased snowfall in a warmer environment will also have largely equilibrated . The most significant difference arises from the contribution of the Greenland ice sheet. Consistent with previous estimates , the rate of the sea level contribution from Greenland increases with temperature. The transient simulations for an instantaneous temperature increase show a quasi-quadratic dependence of the sea level contribution on this temperature increase after 2000 years  . The results are 1189	0

Dashed lines provide linear approximations in  and  with constant slopes of 1.2, 1.8 and 2.3 m C-1. Shading as well as the vertical line represents the uncertainty range as detailed in the text.  2000-year-sea level commitment. The difference in total sea level commitment  compared to the fully equilibrated situation  arises from the Greenland ice sheet which equilibrates on tens of thousands of years. After 2000 years one finds a nonlinear dependence on the temperature increase  consistent with coupled climate-ice sheet simulations by Huybrechts et al.  . The total sea level commitment after 2000 years is quasi-linear with a slope of 2.3 m C-1.	0
Regional sea level changes may differ substantially from a global average, showing complex spatial patterns which result from ocean dynamical processes, movements of the sea floor, and changes in gravity due to water mass redistribution  in the climate system. The regional distribution is associated with natural or anthropogenic climate modes rather than factors causing changes in the global average value, and include such processes as a dynamical redistribution of water masses and a change of water mass properties caused by changes in winds and air pressure, air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes and ocean currents. Because the characteristic time scales of all involved processes are different, their relative contribution to net regional sea level variability or change will depend fundamentally on the time scale considered.	0
decades from tide gauges appear to be steric . Moreover, steric changes observed during the altimetry era appear to be primarily thermosteric in nature, although halosteric effects, which can reduce or enhance thermosteric changes, are also important in some regions . Ocean models and ocean reanalysis-based results  as well as ocean circulation models without data assimilation  confirm these results. Observations and ocean reanalysis  also agree in showing that steric spatial patterns over the last half of the 20th century fluctuate in space and time as part of modes of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system such as ENSO, the NAO, and the PDO . In these cases, regional sea level variability is associated with changing wind fields and resulting changes in the ocean circulation . For example, the large rates of sea level rise in the western tropical Pacific and of sea level fall in the eastern Pacific over the period 1993-2010 1191	0
correspond to an increase in the strength of the trade winds in the central and eastern tropical Pacific over the same period . The long-term sea level trend from 1958 to 2001 in the tropical Pacific can also be explained as the ocean's dynamical response to variations in the wind forcing . Spatial variations in trends in regional sea level may also be specific to a particular sea or ocean basin. For example, a sea level rise of 5.4  0.3 mm yr-1 in the region between Japan and Korea from 1993 to 2001 is nearly two times the GMSL trend, with more than 80% of this rise being thermosteric . Han et al.  found that regional changes of sea level in the Indian Ocean that have emerged since the 1960s are driven by changing surface winds associated with a combined enhancement of Hadley and Walker Cells.	0
13.6.2 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 General Circulation Model Projections on Decadal to Centennial Time Scales CMIP5 projections of regional sea level provide information primarily about dynamical sea level changes resulting from increased heat uptake and changes in the wind forcing. On decadal time scales, the CMIP5 model ensemble identifies strong interannual variability ) associated with ENSO and dynamics of the equatorial current system in the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans . Similar variability in the amplitude of sea level change but due to other climate modes is also apparent in the North Atlantic Current and in parts of the Southern Ocean.	0
Toward the end of the 21st century, the CMIP5 results indicate that it is possible that the interannual to decadal variability of dynamic sea level can weaken in some parts of the world ocean, for example, the western low-latitude Pacific and parts of the Indian Ocean, whereas it could be amplified in other parts, for example, the North Pacific, the eastern tropical Pacific, the eastern subtropical Atlantic and the Arctic . Longer-than-decadal-time-scale regional sea level changes can increasingly be expected to result from long-term changes in the wind field, changes in the regional and global ocean heat and freshwater content and the associated dynamical adjustment , and  from atmospheric pressure. The CMIP5 projections of steric sea level changes toward the end of the 21st century reveal a clear regional pattern in dynamical sea level change , in which the Southern Ocean shows a net decline relative to the global mean, while the remaining global ocean displays complex ridge-and-trough structures superimposed on a generally rising sea level . For example, in the North Atlantic, the largest sea level rise is along and north of the North Atlantic Current, but less so further to the south in the center of the warmer subtropical gyre. A similar dipole pattern was observed in CMIP3 results there due to a weakening of the AMOC which leads to a local steric sea level rise east of North America, resulting in more water on the shelf and directly impacting northeastern North America . A similar pattern can be observed in the North Pacific, but here and in other parts of the world ocean , regional sea level patterns are largely the result of changes in wind forcing, associated changes in the circulation, and an associated redistribution of heat and freshwater. Some regional changes can also be expected to result from modifications in the expansion coefficient due to changes in the ocean's regional heat content . The CMIP5 ensemble indicates that regions showing an enhanced sea level toward the end of the 21st century coincide with those showing the largest uncertainty . Although this also appeared in the earlier CMIP3 SRES A1B results, the CMIP5 results, by comparison, show a general reduction in the ensemble spread, especially in high latitudes. On a global average, this reduction is from 5.7 cm to 2.1 cm, RMS. The contribution of changes of global ocean heat storage to regional steric sea level anomalies is virtually certain to increase with time as the climate warming signal increasingly penetrates into the deep ocean . For the last three decades of the 21st century, the AR4 climate model ensemble mean shows a significant heat storage increase , about half of which is stored in the ocean below 700 m depth. Recent detection of ongoing changes in the ocean salinity structure   may also contribute to future regional steric sea level changes. Halosteric effects can dominate in some regions, especially in regions of highlatitude water mass formation where long-term heat and freshwater changes are expected to occur  . Because of an anticipated increase in atmospheric moisture transport from low to high latitudes , halosteric anomalies are positive in the Arctic Ocean and dominate regional sea level	0
Regional sea level also adjusts to regional changes in atmospheric sea level pressure relative to its instantaneous mean over the ocean. Over time scales longer than a few days, the adjustment is nearly isostatic. Sea level pressure is projected to increase over the subtropics and mid-latitudes  and decrease over high latitudes , especially over the Arctic , by the end of the 21st century associated with a poleward expansion of the Hadley Circulation and a poleward shift of the storm tracks of several degrees latitude  . These changes may therefore contribute positively to the sea level rise in the Arctic in the range of up to 1.5 cm and about 2.5 cm for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively  . In contrast, air pressure changes oppose sea level rise in mid- and low latitudes albeit with small amplitudes. Air pressure may also influence regional sea level elsewhere, as demonstr ated by sea level changes in the Mediterranean in the second half of the 20th century .	0
13.6.4.1 Dynamic Ocean Response to Cryospheric Freshwater Forcing The addition of freshwater from glaciers and ice sheets to the ocean leads to an instantaneous increase in global mean sea level, but because it is communicated around the ocean basins via a dynamical adjustment, it is not instantaneously globally uniform . For the addition of mass, the barotropic adjustment of the ocean takes place in a few days . The addition of freshwater to the ocean from melting of the Greenland ice sheet results in an additional basin-wide steric response of the North Atlantic within months and is communicated to the global ocean via boundary waves, equatorial Kelvin waves, and westward propagating baroclinic Rossby waves on decadal time scales . A similar response but with a different pattern can be observed from Antarctic meltwater input. In both cases, an associated complete baroclinic adjustment of the global ocean might take as long as several centuries. The adjustment of the ocean to high-latitude meltwater input also involves atmospheric teleconnections; such a response to Greenland meltwater pulses could lead to sea level changes in the Pacific within months . On longer-than-decadal time scales, the freshwater input to the North Atlantic raises sea level in the Arctic Ocean and leads to an anomalous southward Bering Strait throughflow, transporting colder, fresher water from the Arctic Ocean into the North Pacific  and causing North Pacific cooling . Meltwater forcing in the subpolar North Atlantic also causes changes of the AMOC , which in turn causes dynamical changes of sea level in the North Atlantic, particularly in its northwestern region . The combination of this dynamic sea level rise and the global mean sea level rise makes the northeastern North American coast vulnerable to some of the fastest and largest sea level rises during this century .	0
Deformational, rotational and gravitational responses to mass redistribution between the cryosphere, the land and the oceans produce distinctive regional departures from GMSL, referred to as sea level fingerprints  . Many existing studies of these effects have not defined a specific rate of ice-sheet mass loss  or are based on end-member scenarios of ice retreat, such as from the WAIS  and marine-based parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet . Bamber and Riva  calculated the sea level fingerprint of all contemporary land-ice melt and each of its major components. Spada et al.  examined the regional sea level pattern from future ice melt based on the A1B scenario. As can be seen from Figure 13.18, a characteristic of the sea level fingerprints is that regions adjacent to the source of the mass loss are 1194	0
subject to relative sea level fall of about an order of magnitude greater than the equivalent GMSL rise from these mass contributions, whereas in the far field the sea level rise is larger  than the global average rise . Gomez et al.  and Mitrovica et al.  showed that differences in the maximum predicted rise  between published results is due to the accuracy with which water expulsion from the deglaciated marine basins is calculated. These changes are in addition to the ongoing response to past changes . Mitrovica et al.  suggested that the lower rates of sea level change inferred from tide gauge records at European sites relative to the global average were consistent with 20th century melting from Greenland. Similarly, Gehrels and Woodworth  suggested that the larger magnitude of the early 20th century sea level acceleration observed in Australia and New Zealand, as compared with the North Atlantic, may represent a fingerprint of the increased melt contributions of Greenland and Arctic glaciers in the 1930s. Nevertheless, current rates of ice-sheet melting are difficult to distinguish from dynamic variability , but it is likely that with further ice-sheet melting they will begin to dominate the regional patterns of sea level change toward the end of the 21st century, especially under climate forcing conditions for which ice-sheet melting contributes more than 20-cm equivalent sea level rise . These changes are in addition to the ongoing response to past changes . Water mass redistributions associated with land hydrology changes other than those from land ice may also produce spatially variable fingerprints in sea level . In particular, regional changes in the terrestrial storage of water can lead to a sea level response on interannual and longer time scales, specifically near large river basins .	0
Regional relative sea level change projections can be estimated from a combination of the various contributions to sea level change described above, emerging from the ocean, atmospheric pressure loading and the solid Earth. Over the next few decades, regional relative sea level changes over most parts of the world are likely to be dominated by dynamical changes  resulting from natural variability, although exceptions are possible at sites near rapidly melting ice sheets where static effects could become large. However, towards the end of the 21st century, regional patterns in sea level from all other contributions will progressively emerge and eventually dominate over the natural variability. Ensemble mean estimates of relative sea level change during the period 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2000 resulting from GIA and from glacier and ice-sheet melting for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios  suggest that for the 21st century, past, present and future loss of land-ice mass will very likely be an important contributor to spatial patterns in relative sea level change, leading to rates of maximum rise at low-to-mid latitudes. Hu et al.  and Sallenger et al.  also	0
It is very likely that over about 95% of the world ocean, regional relative sea level rise will be positive, while most regions that will experience a sea level fall are located near current and former glaciers and ice sheets. Figure 13.21b shows that over most of the oceans , estimated regional sea level changes are significant at the 90% confidence limit. Local sea level changes deviate more than 10% and 25% from the global mean projection for as much as 30% and 9% of the ocean area, respectively, indicating that spatial	0
suggested that steric and dynamical sea level changes can potentially increase the sea level near the northeastern coast of North America and in the western Pacific. Considerable uncertainties remain, however, in both the sea level budget and in the regional expression of sea level rise. In addition, local sea level rise can also partly be compensated by vertical land movement resulting from GIA, especially in some formerly glaciated high-latitude regions where high rates of land uplift may lead to a decrease of relative sea level. For example, Johansson et al.  reported a 29 cm sea level rise in the Gulf of Finland and 27 cm fall in the Bay of Bothnia. The ensemble mean regional relative sea level change between 1986-2005 and 2081-2100 for the RCP4.5 scenario  reveals that many regions are likely to experience regional sea level changes that differ substantially from the global mean .	0

The figure was computed for RCP4.5, but to first order is representative for all RCPs.  Total RCP4.5 sea level change  divided by the combined standard error of all components . Assuming a normal distribution, or a t-distribution given the number of models as an approximation of the number of degrees of freedom, a region passes the 90% confidence level where the change is greater than 2 standard errors, which is most of the ocean except for limited regions around western Antarctica, Greenland and high Arctic regions.	0
v ariations can be large. Regional changes in sea level reach values of up to 30% above the global mean value in the Southern Ocean and around North America, between 10 and 20% in equatorial regions and up to 50% below the global mean in the Arctic region and some regions near Antarctica . Figure 13.22 shows that, between 1986-2005 and 2081-2100, sea level changes along the world's coastlines associated with the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios have a substantially skewed non-Gaussian distribution, with significant coastal deviations from the global mean. When the coastlines around Antarctica and Greenland are excluded , many negative changes disappear, but the general structures of the global histograms remain. In general, changes along the coastlines will range from about 30 cm to 55 cm for an RCP 4.5 scenario, peaking near 50 cm, and from about 40 cm to more than 80 cm under a RCP 8.5 scenario, peaking near 65 cm. About 68% and 72% of the coastlines will experience a relative sea level change within 20% of the GMSL change for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. In both cases, the maximum of the histogram is slightly higher than the GMSL, whereas the arithmetic mean is lower. Only some coastlines will experience a sea level rise of up to about 40% above GMSL change. Figure 13.23 shows the combination of the natural variability  and the CMIP5 projected sea level rise for the RCP4.5 scenario for a number of locations distributed around the world. For example, at Pago Pago  in the western equatorial Pacific, the	0
h istorical record indicates that annual variability in mean sea level has been about 21 cm . Projections by individual climate models indicate that it is very likely that a similar range of natural variability will continue through the 21st century . However, by 2100, the average projected sea level for the RCP4.5 scenario of 0.52  m is greater than any observations of annual mean sea level in the instrumental record. Of all the examples shown, the greatest sea level increase will be in New York, which is representative of the enhanced sea level rise there due to ocean processes and GIA in the region . The figure also reveals the large spatial inhomogeneity of interannual to decadal variability. In each case, monthly variability and extreme sea levels from winds and waves associated with weather phenomena  need to be considered in addition to these projections of regional sea level.	0
Uncertainties of climate models are discussed in detail in Chapter 9. Sea level is a property of the ocean connected to nearly all dynamical and thermodynamical processes over the full ocean column, from the surface fluxes to the ocean bottom. Although many of the processes are to first order correctly simulated in climate models, differences between models  indicate that uncertainties in simulated and projected steric sea level  remain poorly understood. Moreover, the spread in ocean heat uptake efficiency among models is responsible for 50% of the spread in heat uptake . In addition, some processes are not part of the CMIP5 simulations, such as the dynamical response of the ocean to meltwater input or the GIA/rotational/gravitational processes associated with this ice mass loss. Stammer and Huttemann  showed that coupled climate models that do not include the effect of changes in atmospheric moisture content on sea level pressure will underestimate future regional atmospheric pressure loading effects by up to 2 cm. Other uncertainties result from GIA/rotational/gravitational effects as well as from uncertainties in air-sea fluxes. Improvements in the skill of a sea level projection require  better parameterizations of unresolved physical processes,  improved numerical algorithms for such processes as temperature and salinity advection,  refined grid resolution to better represent such features as boundary currents and mesoscale eddies, and  the elimination of obsolete assumptions that have a direct impact on sea level . Among the many limiting approximations made in ocean models, the Boussinesq approximation has been found to only marginally impact regional patterns  when directly compared to non-Boussinesq simulations , thus lending greater confidence in Boussinesq models for addressing questions of regional sea level change. Furthermore, for global sea level, the now-standard a posteriori adjustment  accurately incorporates the missing global steric effect. The representation of dense overflows can also affect sea level simulations, and is particularly problematic in many ocean models used for climate studies, with direct impacts on the simulated vertical patterns of ocean heat uptake . Coarse-resolution ocean-climate simulations require a parameterization of mesoscale and smaller eddies, but the parameterizations as well as the details of their numerical implementations can greatly impact the simulation. As shown by Hallberg and Gnanadesikan  and Farneti et al. , coarse-resolution climate models may be overestimating the Antarctic Circumpolar Current response to wind changes. Better implementations of eddy parameterizations reduce such biases , and they form the basis for some, but not all, of the CMIP5 simulations. Moreover, Vinogradov and Ponte  suggested that as one considers regional sea level variability and its relevant dynamics and forcing, mesoscale ocean features become important factors on a sub-decadal time scale. Suzuki et al.  compared changes in mean dynamic sea level in 2080-2100 relative to 1980-2000 as obtained from a low- and a high-resolution ocean component of a coupled model and concluded that although changes are comparable between runs, the 1197	0

Climate change will affect sea levels extremes and ocean waves in two principal ways. First, because extratropical and tropical storms are one of the key drivers of sea level extremes and waves, future changes in intensity, frequency, duration, and path of these storms will impact them. Second, sea level rise adds to the heights of sea level extremes, regardless of any changes in the storm-related component. MSL change may also accentuate the threat of coastal inundation due to changes in wave runup. Observations of changes in sea level extremes and waves are discussed in Chapter 3. Sea level extremes at the coast occur mainly in the form of storm surges and tsunamis, but because the latter are not climate driven, we assess only projections for sea level extremes based on estimates of future storminess and MSL change.	0
13.7.1 Observed Changes in Sea Level Extremes As discussed in the AR4  and confirmed by more recent studies , statistical analyses of tide-gauge observations have shown an increase in observed sea level extremes worldwide that are caused primarily by an increase in MSL . Dominant modes of climate variability, particularly ENSO and NAO, also have a measureable influence on sea level extremes in many regions . These impacts are due to sea level anomalies associated with climate modes, as well as mode-related changes in storminess. There has been some indication that the amplitude and phase of major tidal constituents have exhibited long-term change , but their impacts on extreme sea level are not well understood. Using particle size analysis of cores collected in the Mackenzie Delta in the Arctic region, Vermaire et al.  inferred increased storm surge activity in the region during the last approximately 150 years, which they related to the annual mean temperature anomaly in the NH and a decrease in summer sea-ice extent.	0
Studies since the AR4 have further assessed the relative contributions of sea level rise and storminess on projected sea level extremes. Lowe et al.  concluded that the increases in the observed sea level extremes in the 20th century occurred primarily through an increase in MSL, and that the same applies to projections for the 21st century. The IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation  assessment concluded that it is very likely that MSL rise will contribute to an increase in future sea level extremes . It noted that changes in storminess may also affect sea level extremes 1200	0
but the limited geographical coverage of studies and uncertainties associated with storminess changes prevent a general assessment. The global tropical cyclone frequency will likely decrease or remain roughly constant, but it is more likely than not that the frequency of the most intense storms will increase in some ocean basins . Uncertainties in projections of cyclone frequency and tracks make it difficult to project how these changes will impact particular regions. Similarly, while the SREX and the current assessment  find that it is likely that there has been a poleward shift in the main northern and southern extra-tropical cyclone tracks during the last 50 years, and that regional changes may be substantial, there is only low confidence in region-specific projections.	0
13.7.2.2 Projections Based on Dynamical and Statistical Approaches Projected changes in storm surges  have been assessed by applying climate-model forcing to storm-surge models. Return periods of sea level extremes  exceeding a given threshold level, referred to as return levels, are used in quantifying projected changes. Using three regionally downscaled GCMs for A2, B2 and A1B scenarios, Debernard and Roed  found an 8 to 10% increase in the 99th percentile surge heights between 1961-1990 and 2071-2100, mainly during the winter season, along the coastlines of the eastern North Sea and the northwestern British Isles, and decreases south of Iceland. Using a downscaled GCM under an A1B scenario, Wang et al.  projected a significant increase in wintertime storm surges around most of Ireland between 1961-1990 and 2031-2060. Sterl et al.  concatenated the output from a 17-member ensemble of A1B simulations from a GCM over the periods 1950-2000 and 2050-2100 into a single longer time series to estimate 10,000-year return levels of surge heights along the Dutch coastline. No statistically significant change in this value was projected for the 21st century because projected wind speed changes were not associated with the maximum surge-generating northerlies. Using an ensemble of three climate models under A2 simulations, Colberg and McInnes  found that changes in the 95th percentile sea level height  across the southern Australian coast in 2081-2100 compared to 1981-2000 were small , mostly negative, and despite some inter-model differences, resembled the changes in wind patterns simulated by the climate models . These studies demonstrate that the results are sensitive to the particular choice of GCM or RCM, therefore identifying uncertainties associated with the projections. For the tropical east coast of Australia, Harper et al.  found that a 10% increase in tropical cyclone intensity for 2050 led to increases in the 100-year return level  that at most locations were smaller than 0.1 m with respect to mean sea level. Several regional storm-surge studies have considered the relative contribution of the two main causative factors on changes in future sea level extremes  for the southeastern coast of Australia; Brown et al.  for the eastern Irish Sea; Woth et al.  for the North Sea; Lowe et al.  for the United Kingdom coast). They concluded that sea level rise has a greater potential than meteorological changes to increase sea level extremes by the end of the 21st century in these locations. Unnikrishnan et al.  used	0
RCM simulations to force a storm-surge model for the Bay of Bengal and found that the combined effect of MSL rise of 4 mm yr-1 and RCM projections for the A2 scenario  gave an increase in 100year return levels of total sea level  between 0.40 to 0.67 m  along the northern part of the east coast of India, except around the head of the bay, compared to those in the base line  scenario. Using six hypothetical hurricanes producing approximate 100-year return levels, Smith et al.  found that in the regions of large surges on the southeastern Louisiana coast, the effect of MSL rise added linearly to the simulated surges. However, in the regions of moderate surges , particularly in wetland-fronted areas, the increase in surge height was 1-3 m larger than the increase in mean sea level rise. They showed that sea level rise alters the speed of propagation of surges and their amplification in different regions of the coast. For the Gulf of Mexico, Mousavi et al.  developed a simple	0
relationship between hurricane-induced storm surges, sea level rise and hurricane intensification through increased SSTs for three modelled major historical cyclones, concluding that the dynamic interaction of surge and sea level rise lowered or amplified the surge at different points within a shallow coastal bay. Higher mean sea levels can significantly decrease the return period for exceeding given threshold levels. For a network of 198 tide gauges covering much of the globe, Hunter  determined the factor by which the frequency of sea levels exceeding a given height would be increased for a MSL rise of 0.5 m . These calculations have been repeated here  using regional RSL projections and their uncertainty using the RCP4.5 scenario . This multiplication factor depends exponentially on the inverse of the Gumbel scale parameter  . The scale parameter is generally	0
large where tides and/or storm surges are large, leading to a small multiplication factor, and vice versa. Figure 13.25a shows that a 0.5 m MSL rise would likely result in the frequency of sea level extremes increasing by an order of magnitude or more in some regions. The multiplication factors are found to be similar or slightly higher, in general, when accounting for regional MSL projections . Specifically, in regions having higher regional projections of MSL, such as the east coast of Canada and the USA  and/or in regions of large uncertainty , the multiplication factor is higher, whereas in regions having lower regional projections of MSL, such as the northwest region of North America , the multiplication factor is lower. In another study, large increases in the frequency of sea level extremes for 2050 were found for a network of sites around the USA coastline based on semi-empirical MSL rise projections and 20th century statistics of extremes . Using projected time series of tides, MSL rise, components of sea level fluctuations from projected MSLP and wind stress fields, and a contribution for ENSO variability through projected SSTs for the 21st century, Cayan et al.  showed that for high-end scenarios of MSL rise, the frequency and magnitude of extremes along the California coast increases considerably relative to those experienced in the 20th century. In summary, dynamical and statistical methods on regional scales show that it is very likely that there will be an increase in the occurrence of future sea level extremes in some regions by 2100, with a likely increase in the early 21st century. The combined effects of MSL rise and changes in storminess will affect future extremes. There is high confidence that extremes will increase with MSL rise yet there is low confidence in region-specific projections in storminess and storm surges.	0
Changes in ocean wave conditions are determined by changes in the major wind systems, especially in the main areas affected by tropical and extra-tropical storms. Based on in situ and satellite altimeter observations and wave-model hindcasts, it is likely that mean significant wave heights  have increased in regions of the North Pacific and the North Atlantic over the past half century, and in the Southern Ocean since the mid 1980s . The limited observational wave record makes it difficult to separate long-term trends from multi decadal variability . A number of studies have related changes in wind-wave climatologies to modes of climate variability such as ENSO , the NAO , and the Southern Annular Mode  . Although anthropogenic influences have been considered , it is likely that reported SWH trends over the past half-century largely reflect natural variations in wind forcing. Recent reductions in summer sea ice extent have resulted in enhanced wave activity in the Arctic Ocean due to increased fetch area and longer duration of the open-water season . 1202	0
In general, there is low confidence in projections of future storm conditions  and hence in projections of ocean waves. Nevertheless, there has been continued progress in translating climate model outputs into wind-wave projections. In the AR4, projected changes in global SWHs were based on a single statistical model . The projected conditions were consistent with increased wind speeds associated with mid-latitude storms, but they considered only a limited five-member ensemble for a single future emission scenario ; wave parameters other than SWH were not considered. Since the AR4, global wave-climate projections for the end of the 21st century have been made by dynamically downscaling CMIP3 AOGCM results. A multi-model ensemble based on dynamical models forced with various GHG emission scenarios , Fan et al. , Semedo et al. ; SRES A2: Hemer et al. , as well as the statistical model of Wang and Swail  forced with emission scenarios IS92a and SRES A2 and B2, has been constructed as part of the Coordinated Ocean Wave Climate Project  . In general, the ensemble projected changes of annual mean SWH  resemble the statistical projections of Wang and Swail  under an A2 scenario. The largest change is projected to be in the Southern Ocean, where mean SWHs at the end of the 21st century are approximately 5 to 10% higher than the present-day mean. SWH increase in this region reflects the projected strengthening of the westerlies over the Southern Ocean, particularly during austral winter . Another region of SWH increase in the ensembles is in the tropical South Pacific associated with a projected strengthening of austral winter easterly trade winds in the CMIP3 multi-model data set . Negligible change or a mean SWH decrease is projected for all other ocean basins, with decreases identified in the trade wind region of the North Pacific, the mid-latitude westerlies in all basins, and in the trade and monsoon wind regions of the Indian Ocean. Hemer et al.  found that variance of wave-climate projections associated with wave downscaling methodology dominated other sources of variance within the projections such as the climate scenario or climate model uncertainties. Mori et al.  reported similar findings. Three CMIP3-based model projections  were used to compare projections of wave direction and period . Wave direction  exhibits clockwise rotation in the tropics, consistent with a higher contribution from northward propagating swell from the Southern Ocean. Wave period  shows an increase over the eastern Pacific, which is also attributed to enhanced wave generation in the Southern Ocean and northward swell propagation. A projected decrease in wave periods in the North Atlantic and western and central North Pacific is symptomatic of weaker wind forcing in these regions. SWH projections based on CMIP5 winds for emission scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5  exhibit similar regional patterns for the end of the 21st century to the CMIP3 results presented in Figure 13.26A. Dobrynin et al.  reported SWH increases in the Arctic Ocean, an area not considered by Hemer et al. , and in basins connected to the Southern Ocean, particularly for RCP8.5. The probability of extreme wave heights is projected to increase in the SH, the	0

Arctic and Indian Oceans, but decrease in the North and Equatorial Atlantic and in the Pacific. In addition to wind changes, the projected loss of summer sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean is very likely to increase overall wave activity there . Model intercomparisons are starting to identify common features of global wave projections but in general there is low confidence in wave model projections because of uncertainties regarding future wind states, particularly storm geography, the limited number of model simulations used in the ensemble averages, and the different methodologies used to downscale climate model results to regional scales . Despite these uncertainties, it appears likely  that enhanced westerly surface winds in the SH  will lead to enhanced wave generation in that region by the end of the 21st century. A number of dynamical wave projection studies have been carried out with a regional focus. For the Mediterranean Sea, Lionello et al.  projected a widespread shift of the wave height distribution to lower values by the mid-21st century under an SRES A1B scenario, implying a decrease in mean and extreme wave heights. Caires et al.  and Debernard and Roed  reported a decrease  in the annual 99th percentile SWH south of Iceland by the end of the 21st century, and an increase  along the North Sea east coast . Grabemann and Weisse  found increases  in annual 99th percentile SWH in the North Sea by the end of the 21st century, with an increase in the frequency of extreme wave events over large areas of the southern and eastern North Sea . Charles et al.  projected a general decrease in wave heights in the Bay of Biscay by the end of the 21st century , accompanied by clockwise rotations in winter swell  and summer sea and intermediate waves . Along the Portuguese coast, Andrade et al.  found little projected change in SWH and a tendency for a more northerly wave direction than present .	0
There has been significant progress in our understanding of sea level change since the AR4. Paleo data now provide high confidence that sea levels were substantially higher when GHG concentrations were higher or surface temperatures were warmer than pre-industrial. The combination of paleo sea level data and long tide gauge records confirms that the rate of rise has increased from low rates of change during the late Holocene  to rates of almost 2 mm yr-1 averaged over the 20th century, with a likely continuing acceleration during the 20th century . Since 1993, the sum of observed contributions to sea level rise is in good agreement with the observed rise. Understanding of the components that contribute to total sea level rise has improved significantly. For the 20th century, the range from an ensemble of such process-based models encompasses the observed rise when allowances are made for lack of inclusion of volcanic forcing in AOGCM control simulations, natural climate variability, and a possible small long-term ice-sheet contribution. Ice-sheet contributions to the 20th century sea level rise were small, however, and this agreement is thus not an evaluation of ice-sheet models. Nevertheless, there has been significant improvement in accounting for important physical processes in ice-sheet models, particularly of the dynamical response of individual glacier systems to warmer ocean waters in the immediate vicinity of the outlet glaciers. Although there are as yet no complete simulations of regional ocean temperature changes near ice sheets and of the ice-sheet response to realistic climate change forcing, the publications to date have allowed an assessment of the likely range of sea level rise for the 21st century .	0
In the Pacific, multi-model projections by Graham et al.   indicate a decrease in boreal winter upper-quantile SWHs over the mid-latitude North Pacific by the end of the 21st century associated with a projected decrease in wind speeds along the southern flank of the main westerlies. There is a less robust tendency for higher extreme waves at higher latitudes. On the southeastern Australian coast, Hemer et al.  used multi-model projections  to identify a decrease in mean SWH  by the end of the 21st century compared to present due to a projected decrease in regional storm wave energy, and a shift to a more southerly wave direction, consistent with a projected southward shift of the subtropical ridge in the forcing fields.

These observations, together with our current scientific understanding and projections of future climate and sea level, imply that it is virtually certain that sea level will continue to rise during the 21st century and beyond. For the first few decades of the 21st century, regional sea level change will be dominated by climate variability superimposed on the climate change signal. For all scenarios, the rate of 21st century GMSL rise is very likely to exceed the average rate during the 20th century. For the RCP8.5 scenario, the projected rate of GMSL rise by the end of the 21st century will approach average rates experienced during the deglaciation of the Earth after the Last Glacial Maximum. These rates imply a significant transfer of mass from the ice sheets to the oceans and associated regional departures of sea level rise from the global average, in addition to the regional patterns from changing atmosphere-ocean interactions. Sea level rise has already led to a significant increase in the return frequency of sea level extremes at many locations, and it is very likely that this will continue during the 21st century, although there is low confidence in projections of changes in storminess. The first assessment of surface waves indicates a likely  increase in the height of waves in the Southern Ocean. Despite this progress, significant uncertainties remain, particularly related to the magnitude and rate of the ice-sheet contribution for the 21st century and beyond, the regional distribution of sea level rise, and the regional changes in storm frequency and intensity. For coastal planning, sea level rise needs to be considered in a risk management framework, requiring knowledge of the frequency of sea level variability  in future climates, projected changes in mean sea level, and the uncertainty of the sea level projections , as well as local issues such as the compaction of sediments in deltaic regions and the changing supply of these sediments to maintain the height of the deltas . Although improved understanding has allowed the projection of a likely range of sea level rise during the 21st century, it has not been possible to quantify a very likely range or give an upper bound to future rise. The potential collapse of ice shelves, as observed on the Antarctic Peninsula , could lead to a larger 21st century rise of up to several tenths of a metre. Sea level will continue to rise for centuries, even if GHG concentrations are stabilized, with the amount of rise dependent on future GHG emissions. For higher emission scenarios and warmer temperatures, surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet is projected to exceed accumulation, leading to its long-term decay and a sea level rise of metres, consistent with paleo sea level data.	0
Cyclones Based on process understanding and agreement in 21st century projections, it is likely that the global frequency of occurrence of tropical cyclones will either decrease or remain essentially unchanged, concurrent with a likely increase in both global mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed and precipitation rates. The future influence of climate change on tropical cyclones is likely to vary by region, but the specific characteristics of the changes are not yet well quantified and there is low confidence in region-specific projections of frequency and intensity. However, better process understanding and model agreement in specific regions provide medium confidence that precipitation will be more extreme near the centres of tropical cyclones making landfall in North and Central America; East Africa; West, East, South and Southeast Asia as well as in Australia and many Pacific islands. Improvements in model resolution and downscaling techniques increase confidence in projections of intense storms, and the frequency of the most intense storms will more likely than not increase substantially in some basins. 	0
Despite systematic biases in simulating storm tracks, most models and studies are in agreement on the future changes in the number of extratropical cyclones . The global number of ETCs is unlikely to decrease by more than a few percent. A small poleward shift is likely in the Southern Hemisphere  storm track. It is more likely than not, based on projections with medium confidence, that the North Pacific storm track will shift poleward. However, it is unlikely that the response of the North Atlantic storm track is a simple poleward shift. There is low confidence in the magnitude of regional storm track changes, and the impact of such changes on regional surface climate. It is very likely that increases in Arctic, Northern European, North American and SH winter precipitation by the end of the 21st century  will result from more precipitation in ETCs associated with enhanced extremes of storm-related precipitation. 	0
Annular and Dipolar Modes of Variability Models are generally able to simulate gross features of annular and dipolar modes. Model agreement in projections indicates that future boreal wintertime North Atlantic Oscillation is very likely to exhibit large natural variations and trend of similar magnitude to that observed in the past and is likely to become slightly more positive on average, with some, but not well documented, implications for winter conditions in the Arctic, North America and Eurasia. The austral summer/autumn positive trend in Southern Annular Mode is likely to weaken considerably as stratospheric ozone recovers through the mid-21st century with some, but not well documented, implications for South America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Antarctica. 	0
Regional climates are the complex outcome of local physical processes and the non-local responses to large-scale phenomena such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation  and other dominant modes of climate variability. The dynamics of regional climates are determined by local weather systems that control the net transport of heat, moisture and momentum into a region. Regional climate is interpreted in the widest sense to mean the whole joint probability distribution of climate variables for a region including the time mean state, the variance and co-variance and the extremes. This chapter assesses the physical basis of future regional climate change in the context of changes in the following types of phenomena: monsoons and tropical convergence zones, large-scale modes of climate variability and tropical and extratropical cyclones. Assessment of future changes in these phenomena is based on climate model projections  and CMIP5 multi-model ensembles described in Chapter 12) and an understanding of how well such models represent the key processes in these phenomena. More generic processes relevant to regional climate change, such as thermodynamic processes and land- atmosphere feedback processes, are assessed in Chapter 12. Local processes such as snow-albedo feedback, moisture feedbacks due to local vegetation, effects of steep complex terrain etc. can be important for changes but are in general beyond the scope of this chapter. The main focus here is on large-scale atmospheric phenomena rather than more local feedback processes or impacts such as floods and droughts. Sections 14.1.1 to 14.1.3 introduce the three main classes of phenomena addressed in this Assessment and then Section 14.1.4 summarizes their main impacts on precipitation and surface temperature. Specific climate phenomena are then addressed in Sections 14.2 to 14.7, which build on key findings from the Fourth Assessment Report, AR4 , and provide an assessment of process understanding and how well models simulate the phenomenon and an assessment of future projections for the phenomena. In Section 14.8, future regional climate changes are assessed, and where possible, interpreted in terms of future changes in phenomena. In particular, the relevance of the various phenomena addressed in this chapter for future climate change in the regions covered in Annex I are emphasized. The regions are those defined in previous regional climate change assessments . Regional Climate Models  and other downscaling tools required for local impact assessments are assessed in Section 9.6 and results from these studies are used where such supporting information adds additional relevant details to the assessment.	0
Regional climates are strongly influenced by modes of climate variability . This chapter assesses major modes such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation , the North Atlantic Oscillation/Northern Annular Mode  and Southern Annular Mode  in the extratropics  and various other well-known modes such as the Pacific North American  pattern, Pacific Decadal Oscillation , Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation , etc. . Many of these modes are described in previous IPCC reports . Chapter 2 gives operational definitions of mode indices  and an assessment of observed historical behaviour . Climate models are generally able to simulate the gross features of many of the modes of variability , and so provide useful tools for understanding how modes might change in the future . Modes and regimes provide a simplified description of variations in the climate system. In the simplest paradigm, variations in climate variables are described by linear projection onto a set of mode indices . For example, a large fraction of interannual variance in Northern Hemisphere  sea level pressure is accounted for by linear combinations of the NAM and the PNA modes . Alternatively, the nonlinear regime paradigm considers the probability distribution of local climate variables to be a multi-modal mixture of distributions related to a discrete set of regimes/types . There is ongoing debate on the relevance of the different paradigms , and care is required when interpreting these constructs . Modes of climate variability may respond to climate change in one or more of the following ways: *	0
An assessment of changes in modes of variability can be problematic for several reasons. First, interpretation depends on how one separates modes of variability from forced changes in the time mean or variations in the annual cycle . Modes of variability are generally defined using indices based on either detrended anomalies  or anomalies obtained by removing the time mean over a historical reference period . The mode index in the latter approach will include changes in the mean, whereas by definition there is no trend in a mode index when it is based on detrended anomalies. Second, it can be difficult to separate natural variations from forced responses, for example, warming trends in the N. Atlantic during the 20th century that may be due to trends in aerosol and other forcings rather than natural internal variability . Finally, modes of climate variability are nonlinearly related to one another  and this relationship can change in time . Even when the change in a mode of variability index does not contribute greatly to mean regional climate change, a climate mode may still play an important role in regional climate variability and extremes. Natural variations, such as those due to modes of variability, are a major source of uncertainty in future projections of mean regional climate . Furthermore, changes in the extremes of regional climate are likely to be sensitive to small changes in variance or shape of the distribution of the mode indices or the mode spatial patterns .	0
Box 14.1, Figure 1 illustrates the large-scale climate phenomena assessed in this chapter. Many of the climate phenomena are evident in the map of annual mean rainfall . The most abundant annual rainfall occurs in the tropical convergence zones: Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone  over the Pacific, Atlantic and African equatorial belt , South Pacific Convergence Zone  over central South Pacific  and South Atlantic Convergence Zone  over Southern South America and Southern Atlantic . In the global monsoon domain , large amounts of precipitation occur but only in certain seasons . Local maxima in precipitation are also apparent over the major storm track regions in mid-latitudes . Box 14.1 Figure 1 also illustrates surface air temperature  and precipitation  teleconnection patterns for ENSO , NAO  and SAM . The teleconnection patterns were obtained by taking the correlation between monthly gridded temperature and precipitation anomalies and indices for the modes . It can be seen that all three modes have far-reaching effects on temperature and precipitation in many parts of the world.

The terms below are used to describe variations in time series variables reported at a set of geographically fixed spatial locations, for example, a set of observing stations or model grid points ). Climate indices Time series constructed from climate variables that provides an aggregate summary of the state of the climate system. For example, the difference between sea level pressure in Iceland and the Azores provides a simple yet useful historical NAO index . Because of their maximum variance properties, climate indices are often defined using principal components.

Climate pattern A set of coefficients obtained by `projection'  of climate variables at different spatial locations onto a climate index time series. Empirical Orthogonal Function The climate pattern obtained if the climate index is a principal component. It is an eigenvector of the covariance matrix of gridded climate data. Teleconnection A statistical association between climate variables at widely separated, geographically fixed spatial locations. Teleconnections are caused by large spatial structures such as basin-wide coupled modes of ocean-atmosphere variability, Rossby wave-trains, mid-latitude jets and storm-tracks, etc. Teleconnection pattern A correlation map obtained by calculating the correlation between variables at different spatial locations and a climate index. It is the special case of a climate pattern obtained for standardized variables and a standardized climate index, that is, the variables and index are each centred and scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. One-point teleconnection maps are made by choosing a variable at one of the locations to be the climate index.  Box 14.1, Table 1 | Regional climate impacts of fundamental modes of variability.	0
decreasing trend . CMIP5 models generally reproduce the observed global monsoon domain, but the disparity between the best and poorest models is large . In the CMIP5 models the global monsoon area , the global monsoon total precipitation  and the global monsoon precipitation intensity  are projected to increase by the end of the 21st century . See Supplementary Material Section 14.SM.1.2 for the definitions of GMA, GMP and GMI. The CMIP5 model projections show an expansion of GMA mainly over the central to eastern tropical Pacific, the southern Indian Ocean and eastern Asia. In all RCP scenarios, GMA is very likely to increase, and GMI is likely to increase, resulting in a very likely increase in GMP, by the end of the 21st century . The 100-year median changes in GMP are +5%, +8%, +10%, and +16% in RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively.

The standard deviation of interannual variability in seasonal average precipitation  is projected to increase by many models but some models show a decrease in Psd. This is related to uncertainties in projections of future changes in tropical sea surface temperature . Regarding seasonality, CMIP5 models project that monsoon onset dates will come earlier or not change much while monsoon retreat dates will delay, resulting in a lengthening of the monsoon season in many regions. CMIP5 models show a decreasing trend of lower-troposphere wind convergence  throughout the 20th and 21st centuries . With increased moisture , the moisture flux convergence shows an increasing trend from 1980 through the 21st century . Surface evaporation shows a similar trend  associated with warmer SSTs.

All models and all scenarios project an increase in both the mean and extreme precipitation in the Indian summer monsoon  .

FAQ 14.1 | How is Climate Change Affecting Monsoons? Monsoons are the most important mode of seasonal climate variation in the tropics, and are responsible for a large fraction of the annual rainfall in many regions. Their strength and timing is related to atmospheric moisture content, land-sea temperature contrast, land cover and use, atmospheric aerosol loadings and other factors. Overall, monsoonal rainfall is projected to become more intense in future, and to affect larger areas, because atmospheric moisture content increases with temperature. However, the localized effects of climate change on regional monsoon strength and variability are complex and more uncertain. Monsoon rains fall over all tropical continents: Asia, Australia, the Americas and Africa. The monsoon circulation is driven by the difference in temperature between land and sea, which varies seasonally with the distribution of solar heating. The duration and amount of rainfall depends on the moisture content of the air, and on the configuration and strength of the atmospheric circulation. The regional distribution of land and ocean also plays a role, as does topography. For example, the Tibetan Plateau--through variations in its snow cover and surface heating--modulates the strength of the complex Asian monsoon systems. Where moist on-shore winds rise over mountains, as they do in southwest India, monsoon rainfall is intensified. On the lee side of such mountains, it lessens. Since the late 1970s, the East Asian summer monsoon has been weakening and not extending as far north as it used to in earlier times , as a result of changes in the atmospheric circulation. That in turn has led to increasing drought in northern China, but floods in the Yangtze River Valley farther south. In contrast, the Indo-Australian and Western Pacific monsoon systems show no coherent trends since the mid-20th century, but are strongly modulated by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation . Similarly, changes observed in the South American monsoon system over the last few decades are strongly related to ENSO variability. Evidence of trends in the North American monsoon system is limited, but a tendency towards heavier rainfalls on the northern side of the main monsoon region has been observed. No systematic long-term trends have been observed in the behaviour of the Indian or the African monsoons. The land surface warms more rapidly than the ocean surface, so that surface temperature contrast is increasing in most regions. The tropical atmospheric overturning circulation, however, slows down on average as the climate warms due to energy balance constraints in the tropical atmosphere. These changes in the atmospheric circulation lead to regional changes in monsoon intensity, area and timing. There are a number of other effects as to how	0
climate change can influence monsoons. Surface heating varies with the intensity of solar radiation absorption, which is itself affected by any land use changes that alter the reflectivity  of the land surface. Also, changing atmospheric aerosol loadings, such as air pollution, affect how much solar radiation reaches the ground, which can change the monsoon circulation by altering summer solar heating of the land surface. Absorption of solar radiation by aerosols, on the other hand, warms the atmosphere, changing the atmospheric heating distribution. The strongest effect of climate change on the monsoons is the increase in atmospheric moisture associated with warming of the atmosphere, resulting in an increase in total monsoon rainfall even if the strength of the monsoon circulation weakens or does not change. Climate model projections through the 21st century show an increase in total monsoon rainfall, largely due to increasing atmospheric moisture content. The total surface area affected by the monsoons is projected to increase, along with the general poleward expansion of the tropical regions. Climate models project from 5% to an approximately 15% increase of global monsoon rainfall depending on scenarios. Though total tropical monsoon rainfall increases, some areas will receive less monsoon rainfall, due to weakening tropical wind circulations. Monsoon onset dates are likely to be early or not to change much and the monsoon retreat dates are likely to delay, resulting in lengthening of the monsoon season. Future regional trends in monsoon intensity and timing remain uncertain in many parts of the world. Year-to-year variations in the monsoons in many tropical regions are affected by ENSO. How ENSO will change in future--and how its effects on monsoon will change--also remain uncertain. However, the projected overall increase in monsoon rainfall indicates a corresponding increase in the risk of extreme rain events in most regions.	0

et al., 2007; Turner et al., 2007a; Kumar et al., 2011b; Sabade et al., 2011). These results are generally confirmed by CMIP5 projections . The projected changes in Indian monsoon rainfall increase with the anthropogenic forcing among RCPs . In a suite of models that realistically simulate ENSO-monsoon relationships, normal monsoon years are likely to become less frequent in the future, but there is no clear consensus about the occurrence of extreme monsoon years . CMIP3 models indicate ENSO-monsoon relationships to persist in the future , but there is low confidence in the projection of ENSO variability . Sub-seasonal scale monsoon variability is linked to the MJO but again the confidence in the future projection of MJO remains low . CMIP5 models project an increase in mean precipitation as well as its interannual variability and extremes . All models project an increase in heavy precipitation events but disagree on CDD changes. Regarding seasonality, model agreement is high on an earlier onset and later retreat, and hence longer duration. The monsoon circulation weakens in the future  but the precipitation increases. Like the global monsoon , the precipitation increase is largely due to the increased moisture flux from ocean to land.	0
14.2.2.2 East Asian Monsoon The East Asian monsoon is characterized by a wet season and southerly flow in summer and by dry cold northerly flow in winter. The East Asian summer  monsoon circulation has experienced an inter-decadal weakening from the 1960s to the 1980s , associated with deficient rainfall in North China and excessive rainfall in central East China along 30N . The summer monsoon circulation has begun to recover in recent decades . The summer rainfall amount over East Asia shows no clear trend during the 20th century , although significant trends may be found in local station records . The winter monsoon circulation weakened significantly after the 1980s . See Supplementary Material Sections 14.SM.1.3 to 14.SM.1.7 for additional discussions of natural variability. CMIP3 models show reasonable skill in simulating large-scale circulation of the EAS monsoon , but their performance is poor in reproducing the monsoon rainband . Only a few CMIP3 models reproduce the Baiu rainband  and high-resolution models  show better performance than low resolution CMIP3 type models in simulating the monsoon rainband (Kitoh and Kusunoki, 1231	0
2008). CMIP3 models show large uncertainties in projections of monsoon precipitation and circulation  but the simulation of interannual variability of the EAS monsoon circulation has improved from CMIP3 to CMIP5 . Climate change may bring a change in the position of the monsoon rain band . CMIP5 projections indicate a likely increase in both the circulation  and rainfall of the EAS monsoon  throughout the 21st century. This is different from other Asian-Australian monsoon subsystems, where the increase in precipitation  is generally associated with weakening monsoon circulation . Interannual variability of seasonal mean rainfall is very likely to increase except for RCP2.6 . Heavy precipitation events  are also very likely to increase. CMIP5 models project an earlier monsoon onset and longer duration but the spread among models is large .	0
14.2.2.3 Maritime Continent Monsoon Interaction between land and water characterizes the Maritime Continent region located between the Asian continent and Australia. It provides a land bridge along which maximum convection marches from the Asian summer monsoon regime  to the Australian summer monsoon system . Phenomena such as the MJO , and ENSO  influence Maritime Continent Monsoon variability. Rainfall extremes in the Maritime Continent are strongly influenced by diurnal rainfall variability  as well as the MJO. There have been no obvious trends in extreme rainfall indices in Indonesia, except evidence of a decrease in some areas in annual rainfall and an increase in the ratio of the wet to dry season rainfall . Modelling the Maritime Continent monsoon is a challenge because of the coarse resolution of contemporary large-scale coupled climate models . Most CMIP3 models tend to simulate increasing precipitation in the tropical central Pacific but declining trends over the Maritime Continent for June to August , consistent with a decreasing zonal SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific and a weakening Walker Circulation . Projections of CMIP5 models are consistent with those of CMIP3 models, with decreasing precipitation during boreal summer and increasing precipitation during boreal winter, but model agreement is not high .	0
stayn et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2008b; Smith et al., 2008), whereas over northeast Australia, summer rainfall has decreased markedly since around 1980 . Models in general show skill in representing the gross spatial characteristics of Australian monsoon summer precipitation . Further, atmospheric General Circulation Models  forced by SST anomalies can skilfully reproduce monsoon-related zonal wind variability over recent decades . Recent analysis of the skill of a suite of CMIP3 models showed a good representation in the ensemble mean, but a very large range of biases across individual models . Most CMIP models have biases in monsoon seasonality, but CMIP5 models generally perform better than CMIP3 . In climate change projections, overall changes in tropical Australian rainfall are small, with substantial uncertainties . Using a group of CMIP5 models that exhibit a realistic present-day climatology, most projections using the RCP8.5 scenario produced 5% to 20% more monsoon rainfall by the late 21st century compared to the pre-industrial period . Most CMIP3 model projections suggest delayed monsoon onset and reduced monsoon duration over northern Australia. Weaker model agreement is seen over the interior of the Australian continent, where ensembles show an approximate 7-day delay of both the onset and retreat with little change in duration . CMIP5 model agreement in changes of monsoon precipitation seasonality is low .	0
14.2.2.5 Western North Pacific Monsoon The western North Pacific summer monsoon  occupies a broad oceanic region of the South China and Philippine Seas, featuring a monsoon trough and a subtropical anticyclonic ridge to the north . The western North Pacific monsoon does not show any trend during 1950-1999. Since the late 1970s, the correlation has strengthened between interannual variability in the western North Pacific monsoon and ENSO , a change mediated by Indian Ocean SST . This occurred despite a weakening of the Indian monsoon-ENSO correlation in this period . CMIP5 models project little change in western North Pacific monsoon circulation  but enhanced precipitation  due to increased moisture convergence .	0
14.2.3.1 North America Monsoon System The warm season precipitation in northern Mexico and the southwestern USA is strongly influenced by the NAMS. It has been difficult to simulate many important NAMS-related phenomenon in global climate models , though the models capture gross-scale features associated with the NAMS seasonal cycle . See Supplementary Material Section 14.SM.1.8 for a more detailed discussion of NAMS dynamics. In the NAMS core region, no distinct precipitation trends have been seen over the last half of the 20th century , due to countervailing trends in increasing intensity and decreasing frequency of events, as well as the decreasing length of the monsoon season itself . However, monsoonal stream flow in western Mexico has been decreasing, possibly as a result of changing precipitation characteristics or antecedent hydrological conditions rather than overall precipitation amounts . There has also been a systematic delay in monsoon onset, peak and termination  as well as an increase in extreme precipitation events associated with land-falling hurricanes . Finally, positive trends in NAMS precipitation amounts have been detected in the northern fringes of the core area, that is, Arizona and western New Mexico , consistent with northward NAMS expansion during relatively warm periods in the Holocene (Petersen,	0
1994; Mock and Brunelle-Daines, 1999; Harrison et al., 2003; Poore et al., 2005; Metcalfe et al., 2010). Over the coming century, CMIP5 simulations generally project a precipitation reduction in the core zone of the monsoon , but this signal is not particularly consistent across models, even under the RCP8.5 scenario . Thus confidence in projections of monsoon precipitation changes is currently low. CMIP5 models have no consensus on future changes of monsoon timing . Temperature increases are consistently projected in all models . This will likely increase the frequency of extreme summer temperatures , together with projected increase in consecutive dry days .	0
Rickenbach, 2010; Seth et al., 2010; Kitoh et al., 2013). As seen below, conclusions regarding SAMS changes can depend on the index chosen. SAMS duration and amplitude obtained from the observed large-scale index have both increased in the last 32 years . Increase of extreme precipitation and consecutive dry days have been observed in the SAMS region from 1969 to 2009 . The overall annual cycle of precipitation in the SAMS region, including SAMS onset and demise, is generally well represented by models . Extreme precipitation indices in SAMS region are also well simulated by CMIP5 models . CMIP5 models subjected to historical forcing show increases in SAMS amplitude, earlier onset and later demise during the 1951-2005 period . Using a precipitation based index, precipitation increases in austral summer but decreases in austral spring, indicating delayed SAMS onset in the CMIP3 projections . CMIP5 projections based on the global precipitation index  consistently show small precipitation increases and little change in onset and retreat . On the other hand, when using a different index, earlier onsets and later demises and thus, longer duration of the SAMS by the end of the 21st century  has been found . Thus there is medium confidence that SAMS overall precipitation will remain unchanged. The different estimates of changes in timing underscores potential uncertainties related to SAMS timing due to differences in SAMS indices. The models do show significant and robust increases in extreme precipitation indices in the SAMS region, such as seasonal maximum 5-day precipitation total and number of consecutive dry days , leading to medium confidence in projections of these characteristics.	0
14.2.4 African Monsoon In Africa, monsoon circulation affects precipitation in West Africa where notable upper air flow reversals are observed. East and south African precipitation is generally described by variations in the tropical convergence zone rather than as a monsoon feature. This section covers the West African monsoon, and Section 14.8.7 also covers the latter two regions. The West African monsoon develops during northern spring and summer, with a rapid northward jump of the rainfall belt from along the Gulf of Guinea at 5N in May to June to the Sahel at 10N in July to August. Factors influencing the West African monsoon include interannual to decadal variations, land processes and the direct response to radiative forcing. Cross-equatorial tropical Atlantic SST patterns influence the monsoon flow and moistening of the boundary layer, so that a colder northern tropical Atlantic induces negative rainfall anomalies .	0
tion is known to limit the ability to capture the mesoscale `squall line' systems that form a central element in the maintenance of the rainy season . Therefore, projections of the West African monsoon rainfall appear to be uncertain, reflected by considerable model deficiencies and spread in the projections . Note that this figure is based on a somewhat eastward extended area for the West African monsoon , seen as a component of the global monsoon system . The limitations of model simulations in the region arising from the lack of convective organization  leading to the underestimation of interannual variability  imply that confidence in projections of the African monsoon is low. The limited information that could be deduced from CMIP3 has not improved much in CMIP5. Figure 14.7 largely confirms the findings based on CMIP3. The CMIP5 model ensemble projects a modest change in the onset date  and a small delay in the retreat date, leading to a small increase in the duration of the rainy season. The delay in the monsoon retreat is larger in the high-end emission scenarios. The interannual variance and the 5-day rain intensity show a robust increase, while a small increase in dry day periods is less significant.	0
It is projected that global monsoon precipitation will likely strengthen in the 21st century with increase in its area and intensity while the monsoon circulation weakens. Precipitation extremes including precipitation intensity and consecutive dry days are likely to increase at higher rates than those of mean precipitation. Overall, CMIP5 models project that the monsoon onset will be earlier or not change much and the monsoon retreat dates will delay, resulting in a lengthening of the monsoon season. Such features are likely to occur in most of Asian-Australian Monsoon regions. There is medium confidence that overall precipitation associated with the Asian-Australian monsoon will increase but with a north-south asymmetry: Indian and East Asian monsoon precipitation is projected to increase, while projected changes in Australian summer monsoon precipitation are small. There is medium confidence that the Indian summer monsoon circulation will weaken, but this is compensated by increased atmospheric moisture content, leading to more precipitation. For the East Asian summer monsoon, both monsoon circulation and precipitation are projected to increase. There is low confidence that over the Maritime Continent boreal summer rainfall will decrease and boreal winter rainfall will increase. There is low confidence that changes in the tropical Australian monsoon rainfall are small. There is low confidence that Western North Pacific summer monsoon circulation changes are small, but with increased rainfall due to enhanced moisture. There is medium confidence in an increase of Indian summer monsoon rainfall and its extremes throughout the 21st century under all RCP scenarios. Their percentage change ratios are the largest and model agreement is highest among all monsoon regions. There is low confidence in projections of American monsoon precipitation changes but there is high confidence in increases of precipitation extremes, of wet days and consecutive dry days. There is medium	0
confidence in precipitation associated with the NAMS will arrive later in the annual cycle, and persist longer. Projections of changes in the timing and duration of the SAMS remain uncertain. There is high confidence in the expansion of SAMS, resulting from increased temperature and humidity. Based on how models represent known drivers of the West African monsoon, there is low confidence in projections of its future development based on CMIP5. Confidence is low in projections of a small delay in the onset of the West African rainy season with an intensification of late-season rains.	0
Section 7.6 presents a radiative perspective of changes in convection , and Section 12.4.5.2 discusses patterns of precipitation change on the global scale. The emphasis here is on regional aspects of tropical changes. Tropical convection over the oceans, averaged for a month or longer, is organized into long and narrow convergence zones, often anchored by SST structures. Latent heat release in convection drives atmospheric circulation and affects global climate. In model experiments where spatially uniform SST warming is imposed, precipitation increases in these tropical convergence zones , following the `wet-get-wetter' paradigm . On the flanks of	0
a convergence zone, rainfall may decrease because of the increased horizontal gradient in specific humidity and the resultant increase in dry advection into the convergence zone . Although these arguments based on moist atmospheric dynamics call for changes in tropical convection to be organized around the climatological rain band, studies since AR4 show that such changes in a warmer climate also depend on the spatial pattern of SST warming. As a result of the SST pattern effect, rainfall change does not generally project onto the climatological convergence zones, especially for the annual mean. In CMIP3/5 model projections, annual rainfall change over tropical oceans follows a `warmer-get-wetter' pattern, increasing where the SST warming exceeds the tropical mean and vice versa . Differences among models in the SST warming pattern are an important source of uncertainty in rainfall projections, accounting for a third of inter-model variability in annual precipitation change in the tropics . Figure 14.8 presents selected indices for several robust patterns of SST warming for RCP8.5. They include greater warming in the NH than in the Southern Hemisphere , a pattern favouring rainfall increase at locations north of the equator and decreases to the south ; enhanced equatorial warming  that anchors a pronounced rainfall increase in the equatorial Pacific; reduced warming in the subtropical Southeast Pacific that weakens convection there; decreased zonal SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific  and increased westward SST gradient across the equatorial 1235	0
2007) and extratropical influences . Many models show an unrealistic double-ITCZ pattern over the tropical Pacific and Atlantic, with excessive rainfall south of the equator . This bias needs to be kept in mind in assessing ITCZ changes in model projections, especially for boreal spring when the model biases are largest. The global zonal mean ITCZ migrates back and forth across the equator following the sun. In CMIP5, seasonal mean rainfall is projected to increase on the equatorward flank of the ITCZ . The co-migration of rainfall increase with the ITCZ is due to the wet-get-wetter effect while the equatorward displacement is due to the SST pattern effect .	0

A southward displacement of SACZ and intensification of the southern centre of the precipitation dipole are suggested in projections of CMIP3 and CMIP5 models . This displacement is consistent with the increased precipitation over southeastern South America, south of 25S, projected for the second half of the 21st century, in CMIP3, CMIP5 and regional models . It is also consistent with the southward displacement of the Atlantic subtropical high  related to the southward expansion of the Hadley Cell . Pacific SST warming and the strengthening of the Pacific-South American -like wave train  are potential mechanisms for changes in the dipolar pattern resulting in SACZ change . This change is also supported by the intensification and increased frequency of the low level jet over South America in future projections .	0
Indian Ocean off Indonesia, and weaker anomalies of the opposite polarity over the rest of the basin . Both modes are statistically significantly correlated with ENSO . CMIP models simulate both modes well . The formation of IOB is linked to ENSO via an atmospheric bridge and surface heat flux adjustment . Ocean-atmosphere interactions within the Indian Ocean are important for the long persistence of this mode . The basin mode affects the termination of ENSO events , it induces coherent atmospheric anomalies in the summer following El Nino , including supressed convection  and reduced tropical cyclone activity  over the Northwest Pacific and anomalous rainfall over East Asia . IOD develops in July to November and involves Bjerknes feedback between zonal SST gradient, zonal wind and thermocline tilt along the equator . A positive IOD event  is associated with droughts in Indonesia, reduced rainfall over Australia, intensified Indian summer monsoon, increased precipitation in East Africa and anomalous conditions in the extratropical SH . Most CMIP3 models are able to reproduce the general features of the IOD, including its phase lock onto the July to November season, while detailed analysis of CMIP5 simulations are not yet available 	0
The projected changes over the equatorial Indian Ocean include easterly wind anomalies, a shoaling thermocline  and reduced SST warming in the east , a result confirmed by CMIP5 multi-model analysis . The change in zonal SST gradient, in turn, reinforces the easterly wind change, indicative of a positive feedback between them as envisioned by Bjerknes . This coupled pattern is most pronounced during July to November, and is broadly consistent with the observed changes in the equatorial Indian Ocean. In one CMIP3 model, the IOB mode and its capacitor effect persist longer, through summer into early fall towards the end of the century . This increased persistence intensifies ENSO's influence on the Northwest Pacific summer monsoon. The confidence level of this relationship is low due to the lack of multi-model studies. The IOD variability in SST remains nearly unchanged in future projections of CMIP3 and CMIP5  despite the easterly wind change that lifts the thermocline  and intensifies thermocline feedback on SST in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. The global increase in atmospheric dry static stability weakens the atmospheric response to zonal SST gradient changes,	0

The Atlantic features a northward-displaced ITCZ , and a cold tongue that develops in boreal summer. Climate models generally fail to simulate these characteristics of tropical Atlantic climate . The biases severely limit model skill in simulating modes of Atlantic climate variability and in projecting future climate change in the Atlantic sector. In-depth analysis of the CMIP5 projections of Atlantic Ocean Modes has not yet been fully explored, but see Section 12.4.3. The inter-hemispheric SST gradient displays pronounced interannual to decadal variability , referred to as the Atlantic meridional mode . A thermodynamic feedback between surface winds, evaporation and SST  is fundamental to the AMM . This mode affects precipitation in northeastern Brazil by displacing the ITCZ , and Atlantic hurricane activity . The Atlantic Nino mode represents interannual variability in the equatorial cold tongue, akin to ENSO . Bjerknes feedback is considered important for energizing the mode . This mode affects the West Africa Monsoon .	0
Over the past century, the Atlantic has experienced a pronounced and persistent warming trend. The warming has brought detectable changes in atmospheric circulation and rainfall patterns in the region. In particular, the ITCZ has shifted southward and land precipitation has increased over the equatorial Amazon, equatorial West Africa, and along the Guinea coast, while it has decreased over the Sahel . Atlantic Nino variability has weakened by 40% in amplitude from 1960 to 1999, associated with a weakening of the equatorial cold tongue . The CMIP3 20th century climate simulations generally capture the warming trend of the basin-averaged SST over the tropical Atlantic. A majority of the models also seem to capture the secular trend in the tropical Atlantic SST inter-hemispheric gradient and, as a result, the southward shift of the Atlantic ITCZ over the past century . Many CMIP3 model simulations with the A1B emission scenario show only minor changes in the SST variance associated with the AMM. However, the few models that give the best AMM simulation over the 20th century project a weakening in future AMM activity , possibly due to the northward shift of the ITCZ . At present, model projections of future change in AMM activity is considered highly uncertain because of the poorly simulated Atlantic ITCZ. In fact, uncertainty in projected changes in Atlantic meridional SST gradient limits the confidence in regional climate projections surrounding the tropical Atlantic Ocean . A majority of CMIP3 models forced with the A1B emission scenario project no major change in Atlantic Nino activity in the 21st century, 1239	0
14.3.5 Assessment Summary There is medium confidence that annual rainfall changes over tropical oceans follow a `warmer-get-wetter' pattern, increasing where the SST warming exceeds the tropical mean and vice versa. One third of inter-model differences in precipitation projection are due to those in SST pattern. The SST pattern effect on precipitation change is a new finding since AR4. The wet-get-wetter effect is more obvious in the seasonal than annual rainfall change in the tropics. Confidence is generally higher in seasonal than in annual mean changes in tropical precipitation. There is medium confidence that seasonal rainfall will increase on the equatorward flank of the current ITCZ; that the frequency of zonally oriented SPCZ events will increase, with the SPCZ lying well to the northeast of its average position during those events; and that the SACZ shifts southwards, in conjunction with the southward displacement of the South Atlantic subtropical high, leading to an increase in precipitation over southeastern South America. Owing to models' ability to reproduce general features of IOD and agreement on future projections, it is likely that the tropical Indian Ocean will feature a zonal pattern with reduced  warming and decreased  rainfall in the east , a pattern especially pronounced during August to November. The Indian Ocean dipole mode will very likely remain active, with interannual variability unchanged in SST but decreasing in thermocline depth. There is low confidence in changes in the summer persistence of the Indian Ocean SST response to ENSO and in ENSO's influence on summer climate over the Northwest Pacific and East Asia.	0
SST in the western tropical Pacific has increased by up to 1.5C per century, and the warm pool has expanded . Studies disagree on how the east- west SST gradient along the equator has changed, some showing a strengthening  and others showing a weakening , because of observational uncertainties associated with limited data sampling, changing measurement techniques, and analysis procedures. Most CMIP3 and CMIP5 models also disagree on the response of zonal SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific . The Pacific Ocean warms more near the equator than in the subtropics in CMIP3 and CMIP5 projections  because of the difference in evaporative damping . Other oceanic changes include a basin-wide thermocline shoaling , a weakening of surface currents, and a slight upward shift and strengthening of the equatorial undercurrent . A weakening of tropical atmosphere circulation during the 20th century was documented in observations and reanalyses  and in CMIP models . The Pacific Walker Circulation, however, intensified during the most recent two decades , illustrating the effects of natural variability.	0

Typical conditions during an El Nino event. SSTs are anomalously warm in the east; convection moves into the central Pacific; the trade winds weaken in the east and the Walker Circulation is disrupted; the thermocline flattens and the upwelling is reduced.

The trade winds weaken; the thermocline flattens and shoals; the upwelling is reduced although the mean vertical temperature gradient is increased; and SSTs  increase more on the equator than off. Diagrams with absolute SST fields are shown on the left, diagrams with SST anomalies are shown on the right. For the climate change fields, anomalies are expressed with respect to the basin average temperature change so that blue colours indicate a warming smaller than the basin mean, not a cooling .	0
appears to occur more often in the central Pacific , with global impacts that are distinct from `standard' El Nino events where the maximum warming is over the eastern Pacific . During the past century, an increasing trend in ENSO amplitude was also observed , possibly caused by a warming climate  although other reconstructions in this data-sparse region dispute this trend . Long coupled GCM simulations show that decadal-to-centennial modulations of ENSO can be generated without any change in external forcing , with multi-decadal epochs of anomalous ENSO behaviour. The modulations result from nonlinear processes in the tropical climate system , the interaction with the mean climate state , or from random changes in ENSO activity triggered by chaotic atmospheric variability . There is little consensus as to whether the decadal modulations of ENSO properties  during recent decades are due to anthropogenic effects or natural variability. Instrumental SST records are available back to the 1850s, but good observations of the coupled air-sea feedbacks that control ENSO behaviour-- including subsurface temperature and current fluctuations, and air-sea exchanges of heat, momentum and water--are available only after the late 1970s, making observed historical variations in ENSO feedbacks highly uncertain .	0

There is little improvement in the CMIP5 ensemble relative to CMIP3 in the amplitude and spatial correlation metrics of precipitation teleconnections in response to ENSO, in particular within regions of strong observed precipitation teleconnections . Scenario projections in CMIP3 and CMIP5 showed a systematic eastward shift in both El Nino- and La Nina-induced teleconnection patterns over the extratropical NH , which might be due to the eastward migration of tropical convection centres associated with the expansion of the warm pool in a warm climate , or changes in the mid-latitude mean circulation . Some models produced an intensified ENSO teleconnection pattern over the North Atlantic region in a warmer climate  and a weakened teleconnection pattern over the North Pacific . It is unclear whether the eastward shift of tropical convection is related to longitudinal shifts in El Nino maximum SST anomalies  or to changes in the mean state in the tropical Pacific. Some coupled GCMs, which do not show an increase in the central Pacific warming during El Nino in response to a warming climate, do not produce a substantial change in the longitudinal location of tropical convection .	0
ENSO shows considerable inter-decadal modulations in amplitude and spatial pattern within the instrumental record. Models without changes in external forcing display similar modulations, and there is little consensus on whether the observed changes in ENSO are due to external forcing or natural variability . There is high confidence that ENSO will remain the dominant mode of interannual variability with global influences in the 21st century, and due to changes in moisture availability ENSO-induced rainfall variability on regional scales will intensify. There is medium confidence that ENSO-induced teleconnection patterns will shift eastward over the North Pacific and North America. There is low confidence in changes in the intensity and spatial pattern of El Nino in a warmer climate.	0

14.5.1 Northern Modes The NAO is a well-established dipolar mode of climate variability having opposite variations in sea level pressure between the Atlantic subtropical high and the Iceland/Arctic low . It is strongly associated with the tropospheric jet, storms , and blocking that determine the weather and climate over the North Atlantic and surrounding continents . The NAO exists in boreal summer as well as in boreal winter, albeit with different physical characteristics . Over the North Pacific, there is a similar wintertime dipolar mode known as the NPO associated with north-south displacements of the Asian-Pacific jet stream and the Pacific storm track. The NPO influences winter air temperature and precipitation over much of western North America as well as sea ice over the Pacific sector of the Arctic, more so than either ENSO  or the PNA . These dipolar modes have been interpreted as the regional manifestation of an annular mode in sea level pressure known as the Arctic Oscillation  or the Northern Annular Mode . The AO  index and the NAO index  are strongly correlated but the AO spatial pattern is more zonally symmetric and so differs from the NAO over the N. Pacific . Hereafter, the term NAO is used to denote NAO, AO and NAM in boreal winter unless further distinction is required. Climate models are generally able to simulate the gross features of NAO and NPO . It has been argued that these modes may be a preferred pattern of response to climate change . However, this is not supported by a detailed examination of the vertical structure of the simulated global warming response . Hori et al.  noted that NAO variability did not change substantially in the Special Report on Emission Scenarios -A1B and 20th century scenarios and so concluded that the trend in the NAO index  is a result of an anthropogenic trend in the basic mean state rather than due to changes in NAO variability. However, other research indicates that there is a coherent two-way interaction between the trend in the mean state and the NAO-like modes of variability--the mode and/or regime structure change due to changes in the mean state . Section 14.6.2 assesses the jet and storm track changes associated with the projected responses.	0
even considered NAO to be a source of natural variability that needs to be removed before detection and attribution of anthropogenic changes . Detection of regional surface air temperature response to anthropogenic forcing has been found to be robust to the exclusion of model-simulated AO and PNA changes . Model projections of wintertime European precipitation have been shown to become more consistent with observed trends after removal of trends due to NAO . Underestimation of trends in NAO can lead to biases in projections of regional climate, for example, Arctic sea ice . Underestimation of NAO long-term variability may be due to missing or poorly represented processes in climate models. Recent observational and modelling studies have helped to confirm that the lower stratosphere plays an important role in explaining recent more negative NAO winters and long-term trends in NAO . This is supported by evidence that seasonal forecasts of NAO can be improved by inclusion of the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation . Other studies have found that observed changes in stratospheric water vapour changes from 1965-1995 led to an impact on NAO simulated by a model, and have suggested that changes in stratospheric water vapour may be another possible pathway for communicating tropical forcing to the extratropics . There is growing evidence that future NAO projections are sensitive to how climate models resolve stratospheric processes and troposphere-stratosphere interactions . Several recent studies of historical data have found a positive association between solar activity and NAO , while other studies have found little imprint of solar and volcanic forcing on NAO . Positive associations between NAO and solar forcing have been reproduced in recent modelling studies  but no significant changes were found in CMIP5 projections of NAO due to changes in solar irradiance or aerosol forcing. Observational studies have noted weakening of NAO during periods of reduced Arctic sea ice . Several modelling studies have also shown a negative NAO response to the partial removal of sea ice in the Arctic or high latitudes . However, the strength and timing of the response to sea ice loss varies considerably between studies, and can be hard to separate from common responses to warming of the troposphere and from natural climate variability. The impact of sea ice loss in individual years on NAO is small and hard to detect . Reviews of the emerging literature on this topic can be found in Budikova  and Bader et al. . The NPO contributes to the excitation of ENSO events via the `Seasonal Footprinting Mechanism' . Some studies indicate that warm events in the central tropical Pacific Ocean may in turn excite the NPO .	0
Recent multi-model studies of NAO  reconfirm the small positive response of boreal winter NAO indices to GHG forcing noted in earlier studies reported in AR4 . Projected trends in wintertime NAO indices are generally found to have small amplitude compared to natural internal variations . Furthermore, there is substantial variation in NAO projections from different climate models. For example, one study found no significant NAO trends in two simulations with the ECHAM4/OPYC3 model , whereas another study found a strong positive trend in NAO in the ECHAM5/MPI-OM SRES A1B simulations . The model dependence of the response is an important source of uncertainty in the regional climate change response . A multi-model study of 24 climate model projections suggests that there are no major changes in the NPO due to greenhouse warming .	0
Some differences in model projections can be accounted for by changes in the NAO spatial pattern, for example, northeastward shifts in NAO centres of action have been found to be important for estimating the trend in the NAO index . Individual model simulations have shown the spatial extent of NAO influence decreases with GHG forcing , a positive feedback between jet and storm tracks that enhances a poleward shift in the NAO pattern , and changes in the NAO pattern but with no changes in the propagation conditions for Rossby waves . One modelling study found a trend in the correlation between NAO and ENSO during the 21st century . Such changes in the structure of NAO and/or its interaction with other modes of variability would could lead to important regional climate impacts.	0

Panels - show scatter plots of individual model 2081-2100 time means versus 1986-2005 time means  together with  standard error bars. The NAO index is defined here as the difference of regional averages:  minus  . The NAM and SAM are defined as zonal indices: NAM as the difference in zonal mean SLP at 35N and 65N  and SAM as the difference in zonal mean SLP at 40S and 65S . All indices have been centred to have zero time mean from 1861-1900. Comparison of simulated and observed trends from 1961-2011 is shown in Figure 10.13.	0
The physical mechanisms of the SAM are well understood, and the SAM is well represented in climate models, although the detailed spatial and temporal characteristics vary between models . In the past few decades the SAM index has exhibited a positive trend in austral summer and autumn , a change attributed to the effects of ozone depletion and, to a lesser extent, the increase in GHGs . It is likely that these two factors will continue to be the principal drivers into the future, but as the ozone hole recovers they will be competing to push the SAM in opposite directions , at least during late austral spring and summer, when ozone depletion has had its greatest impact on the SAM. The SAM is also influenced by teleconnections to the tropics, primarily associated with ENSO . Changes to the tropical circulation, and to such teleconnections, as the climate warms could further affect SAM variability . See Supplementary Material Section 14.SM.3.1 for further details on the observed variability of SAM. The CMIP3 models projected a continuing positive trend in the SAM in both summer and winter . However, those models generally had poor simulations of stratospheric ozone, and tended to underestimate natural variability and to misrepresent observed trends in the SAM, indicating that care should be taken in interpretation of their future SAM projections . Arblaster et al.  showed that there can be large differences in the sensitivity of these models to CO2 increases, which affects their projected trends in the SAM. Since the AR4 a number of chemistry-climate models  have been run that have fully interactive stratospheric chemistry, although unlike coupled atmosphere ocean models they are usually not coupled to the oceans . The majority of CCMs and coupled models, which generally compare well to reanalyses  although many exhibit biases in their placement of the SH eddy-driven jet , indicate that through to at least the mid-21st century	0
the current observed SAM changes are neutralized or reversed during austral summer . Figure 14.16 shows the projected ensemble-mean future SAM index evolution during DJF from a suite of CMIP5 models, suggesting that the recent positive trend will weaken considerably as stratospheric ozone concentrations recover over southern high latitudes. Projected 21st century changes in the SAM, and the closely associated SH eddy-driven jet position, vary by season , and are sensitive to the rate of ozone recovery  and to GHG emissions scenario . In the RCP2.6 scenario, with small increases in GHGs, ozone recovery may dominate in austral summer giving a small projected equatorward jet shift  with little change in the annual mean jet position . In RCP8.5 large GHG increases are expected to dominate, giving an ongoing poleward shift of the SH jet in all seasons . In RCP4.5 the influences of ozone recovery and GHG increases are expected to approximately balance in austral summer, with an ongoing poleward jet shift projected in the other seasons .	0
Future boreal wintertime NAO is very likely to exhibit large natural variations and trend of similar magnitude to that observed in the past; is very likely to be differ quantitatively from individual climate model projections; is likely to become slightly more positive  due to increases in GHGs. The austral summer/autumn positive trend in SAM is likely to weaken considerably as ozone depletion recovers through to the mid-21st century. There is medium confidence from recent studies that projected changes in NAO and SAM are sensitive to boundary processes, which are not yet well represented in many climate models currently used for projections, for example, stratosphere-troposphere interaction, ozone chemistry, solar forcing and atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice loss. There is low confidence in projections of other modes such as the NPO due to the small number of modelling studies.	0
Box 14.2 | Blocking Atmospheric blocking is associated with persistent, slow-moving high-pressure systems that interrupt the prevailing westerly winds of middle and high latitudes and the normal eastward progress of extratropical storm systems. Overall, blocking activity is more frequent at the exit zones of the jet stream and shows appreciable seasonal variability in both hemispheres, reaching a maximum in winter- spring and a minimum in summer-autumn . In the Northern Hemisphere , the preferred locations for winter blocking are the North Atlantic and North Pacific, whereas continental blocks are relatively more frequent in summer . Southern Hemisphere  blocking is less frequent than in the NH, and it tends to be concentrated over the Southeast Pacific and the Indian Ocean . Blocking is a complex phenomenon that involves large- and small-scale components of the atmospheric circulation, and their mutual interactions. Although there is not a widely accepted blocking theory, transient eddy activity is considered to play an important role in blocking occurrence and maintenance through feedbacks between the large-scale flow and synoptic eddies . 	0
Blocking is an important component of intraseasonal variability in the extratropics and causes climate anomalies over large areas of Europe , North America , East Asia , high-latitude regions of the SH  and Antarctica . Blocking can also be responsible for extreme events , such as cold spells in winter  and summer heat waves in the NH  and in southern Australia . At interannual time scales, there are statistically significant relationships between blocking activity and several dominant modes of atmospheric variability, such as the NAO  and wintertime blocking in the Euro-Atlantic sector , the winter PNA  and blocking frequency in the North Pacific , or the SAM  and winter blocking activity near the New Zealand sector . Multi-decadal variability in winter blocking over the North Atlantic and the North Pacific seem to be related, respectively, with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation  and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation , although this remains an open question. Other important scientific issues related to the blocking phenomenon include the mechanisms of blocking onset and maintenance, twoway interactions between blocking and stratospheric processes , influence on blocking of slowly varying components of the climate system , sea ice, etc., Liu et al., 2012b), and external forcings. The most consistent long-term observed trends in blocking for the second half of the 20th century are the reduced winter activity over the North Atlantic , which is consistent with the observed increasing North Atlantic Oscillation  trend from the 1960s to the mid-1990s , as well as an eastward shift of intense winter blocking over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans . The apparent decreasing trend in SH blocking activity  seems to be in agreement with the upward trend in the SAM. The AR4  reported a tendency for General Circulation Models  to underestimate NH blocking frequency and persistence, although most models were able to capture the preferred locations for blocking occurrence and their seasonal distributions. Several intercomparison studies based on a set of CMIP3 models  revealed some progress in the simulation of NH blocking activity, mainly in the North Pacific, but only modest improvements in the North Atlantic. In the SH, blocking frequency and duration was also underestimated, particularly over the Australia-New Zealand sector . CMIP5 models still show a general blocking frequency underestimation over the Euro-Atlantic sector, and some tendency to overestimate North Pacific blocking , with considerable inter-model spread . Model biases in the mean flow, rather than in variability, can explain a large part of the blocking underestimation and they are usually evidenced as excessive zonality of the flow or systematic shifts in the latitude of the jet stream . Increasing the horizontal resolution in atmospheric GCMs with prescribed SSTs has been shown to significantly reduce blocking biases, particularly in the Euro-Atlantic sector and Australasian sectors , while North Pacific blocking could be more sensitive to systematic errors in tropical SSTs . Also blocking biases are smaller in those CMIP5 models with higher horizontal and vertical resolution . However, the improvement of blocking simulation with increasing horizontal resolution is less clear in coupled models than in atmospheric GCMs with prescribed SSTs, indicating that both SSTs and the relative coarse resolution in OGCM  are important causes of blocking biases. Most CMIP3 models projected significant reductions in NH annual blocking frequency , particularly during winter, but CMIP5 models seem to indicate weaker decreases in the future  and a more complex response than that reported for CMIP3 models, including possible regional increases of blocking frequency in summer . There is high agreement that winter blocking frequency over the North Atlantic and North Pacific will not increase under enhanced GHG concentrations . Future strengthening of the zonal wind and meridional jet displacements may partially account for some of the projected changes in blocking frequency over the ocean basins of both hemispheres . Future trends in blocking intensity and persistence are even more uncertain, with no clear signs of significant changes. How the location and frequency of blocking events will evolve in future are both critically important for understanding regional climate change in particular with respect to extreme conditions . 	0

q uantification of natural variability in these measures . Observed regional climate variability generally represents a complex convolution of natural and anthropogenic factors, and the response of tropical cyclones to each factor is not yet well understood . For example, the steady long-term increase in tropical Atlantic SST due to increasing GHGs can be dominated by shorter-term decadal variability forced by both external and internal factors . Similarly, tropical upper-tropospheric temperatures, which modulate tropical cyclone potential intensity , can be forced by slowly evolving changes in the stratospheric circulation of ozone  due to climate change with occasional large amplitude and persistent changes forced by volcanic eruptions (Thompson and	0
S olomon, 2009; Evan, 2012). This convolution of anthropogenic and natural factors, as represented in a climate model, has also been shown to be useful in prediction of Atlantic tropical storm frequency out to a few years . In addition to greenhouse warming scenarios, tropical cyclones can also respond to anthropogenic forcing via different and possibly unexpected pathways. For example, increasing anthropogenic emissions of black carbon and other aerosols in South Asia has been linked to a reduction of SST gradients in the Northern Indian Ocean , which has in turn been linked to a weakening of the vertical wind shear in the region. Evan et al.  linked the reduced wind shear to the observed increase in the number of very intense storms in the Arabian Sea, including five very severe cyclones that have occurred since 1998, but the fundamental cause of this proposed linkage is not yet certain . Furthermore, it is possible that a substantial part of the multi-decadal variability of North Atlantic SST is radiatively forced, via the cloud albedo effect, by what are essentially pollution aerosols emitted from North America and Europe , although the relative contribution of this forcing to the observed variability has been questioned . Note that in the North Atlantic, the evidence suggests that the reduction of pollution aerosols is linked to tropical SST increases, while in the northern Indian Ocean, increases in aerosol pollution have been linked to reduced vertical wind shear. Both of these effects  have been observed to be related to increased tropical cyclone activity. Finally, in addition to interannual-to-multi-decadal forcing of tropical Atlantic SST via radiative dimming , dust aerosols have a large and more immediate in situ effect on the regional thermodynamic and kinematic environment , and Saharan dust storms--whose frequency has been linked to atmospheric CO2 concentration --have also been linked to reduced strengthening of tropical cyclones . Direct in situ relationships have also been identified between aerosol pollution concentrations and tropical cyclone structure and intensity . Thus, when assessing changes in tropical cyclone activity, it is clear that detection and attribution aimed simply at long-term linear trends forced by increasing well-mixed GHGs is not adequate to provide a complete picture of the potential anthropogenic contributions to the changes in tropical cyclone activity that have been observed .	0
increase by about 20% within 100 km of the cyclone centre. However, inter-model differences in regional projections lead to lower confidence in basin-specific projections, and confidence is particularly low for projections of frequency within individual basins. For example, a recent study by Ying et al.  showed that numerical projections of 21st century changes in tropical cyclone frequency in the western North Pacific range broadly from -70% to +60%, while there is better model agreement in measures of mean intensity and precipitation, which are projected to change in the region by -3% to +18% and +5% to +30%, respectively. The available modelling studies that are capable of producing very strong cyclones typically project substantial increases in the frequency of the most intense cyclones and it is more likely than not that this increase will be larger than 10% in some basins . It should be emphasized that this metric is generally more important to physical and societal impacts than overall frequency or mean intensity. As seen in Tables 14.SM.1 to 14.SM.4 of the Supplementary Material, as well as the previous assessments noted above, model projections often vary in the details of the models and the experiments performed, and it is difficult to objectively assess their combined results to form a consensus, particularly by region. It is useful to do this after normalizing the model output using a combination of objective and subjective expert judgements. The results of this are shown in Figure 14.17, and are based on a subjective normalization of the model output to four common metrics under a common future scenario projected through the 21st century. The global assessment is essentially the same as Knutson et al.  and the assessment of projections in the western North Pacific is essentially unchanged from Ying et al. . The annual frequency of tropical cyclones is generally projected to decrease or remain essentially unchanged in the next century in most regions although as noted above, the confidence in the projections is lower in specified regions than global projections. The decrease in storm frequency is apparently related to a projected decrease of upward deep convective mass flux and increase in the saturation deficit of the middle troposphere in the tropics associated with global warming . A number of experiments that are able to simulate intense tropical cyclones project increases in the frequency of these storms in some regions, although there are presently only limited studies to assess and there is insufficient data to draw from in most regions to make a confident assessment . Confidence is somewhat better in the North Atlantic and western North Pacific basins where an increase in the frequency of the strongest storms is more likely than not. The models generally project an increase in mean lifetime-maximum intensity of simulated storms , which is consistent with a projected increase in the frequency in the more intense storms . The projected increase in intensity concurrent with a projected decrease in frequency can be argued to result from a difference in scaling between projected changes in surface enthalpy fluxes and the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship associated with the moist static energy of the middle troposphere . The increase in rainfall rates associated with 1249	0
is modulated in most regions by known modes of atmosphere-ocean variability. The details of the relationships vary by region . Similarly, it has been demonstrated that accurate modelling of tropical cyclone activity fundamentally depends on the model's ability to reproduce these modes of variability . Reliable projections of future tropical cyclone activity, both global and regional, will then depend critically on reliable projections of the behaviour of these modes of variability  under global warming, as well as an adequate understanding of their physical links with tropical cyclones. At present there is still uncertainty in their projected behaviours .	0
A number of studies since the AR4 have attempted to project future changes in tropical cyclone tracks and genesis at inter- or intra-basin scale . These studies suggest that projected changes in tropical cyclone activity are strongly correlated with projected changes in the spatial pattern of tropical SST  and associated weakening of the Pacific Walker Circulation , indicating that reliable projections of regional tropical cyclone activity depend critically on the reliability of the projected pattern of SST changes. However, assessing changes in regional tropical cyclone frequency is still limited because confidence in projections critically depend on the performance of control simulations , and current climate models still fail to simulate observed temporal and spatial variations in tropical cyclone frequency . As noted above, tropical cyclone genesis and track variability	0
The reduction in signal-to-noise ratio that accompanies changing focus from global to regional scales also lengthens the emergence time scale . Based on changes in tropical cyclone intensity predicted by idealized numerical simulations with carbon dioxide -induced tropical SST warming, Knutson and Tuleya  suggested that clearly detectable increases may not be manifest for decades to come. The more recent high-resolution dynamical downscaling study of Bender et al.  supports this argument and suggests that the predicted increases in the frequency of the strongest Atlantic storms may not emerge as a statistically significant signal until the latter half of the 21st century under the SRES A1B emissionscenario. However, regional forcing by agents other than GHGs,	0

All values represent expected percent change in the average over period 2081-2100 relative to 2000-2019, under an A1B-like scenario, based on expert judgement after subjective normalization of the model projections. Four metrics were considered: the percent change in  the total annual frequency of tropical storms,  the annual frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms,  the mean Lifetime Maximum Intensity  and  the precipitation rate within 200 km of storm centre at the time of LMI. For each metric plotted, the solid blue line is the best guess of the expected percent change, and the coloured bar provides the 67%  confidence interval for this value . Where a metric is not plotted, there are insufficient data  available to complete an assessment. A randomly drawn  selection of historical storm tracks are underlain to identify regions of tropical cyclone activity.	0
Some agreement on the response of storm tracks to anthropogenic forcing started to emerge in the climate model projections from CMIP3, with many models projecting a poleward shift of the storm tracks  and an expansion of the tropics . As stated in AR4  this response is particularly clear in the SH, but less clear in the NH. Although clearer in zonal mean responses , regional responses at different longitudes differ widely from this in many models . There is a strong two-way coupling between storm tracks and the large-scale circulation , which results in associated shifts in storm tracks and westerly jet streams .	0
14.6.2.1 Process Understanding of Future Changes Future storm track change is the result of several different competing dynamical influences . It is becoming apparent that the relatively modest storm track response in many models reflects the partial cancelling of opposing tendencies . One of the most important factors is the change in the meridional temperature gradient from which ETCs draw most of their energy. This gradient is projected to increase in the upper troposphere due to tropical amplification and decrease in the lower troposphere due to polar amplification, and it is still unclear whether this will lead to an overall increase or decrease in ETC activity. The projected response can involve an increase in eddy activity at upper levels and a decrease at lower levels , although in other models changes in low level eddy activity are more in line with the upper level wind changes . The projected warming pattern also changes vertical temperature gradients leading to increased stability at low latitudes and decreased stability at higher latitudes, and there is some modelling evidence that this may be a strong factor in the response . Increasing depth of the troposphere might also be important for future changes . Uncertainties in the projections of large-scale warming contribute to uncertainty in the storm track response . Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how the storm tracks respond to the large-scale changes, including changes in eddy phase speed , eddy source regions  and eddy length scales  with a subsequent effect on wave-breaking characteristics . Furthermore, changes in the large-scale warming might also be partly due to changes in the storm tracks due to the two-way coupling between storm tracks and	0
the large-scale flow. However, there is evidence that the amplitude of the tropical and polar warming are largely determined by atmospheric poleward heat fluxes set by local processes . Local processes could prove important for the storm track response in certain regions, for example, sea ice loss  and spatial changes in SSTs . Local land-sea contrast in warming also has a local influence on baroclinicity along the eastern continental coastlines . It is not clear how the storm track responds to multiple forcings with some studies suggesting a linear response  while others suggest more complex interaction . The projected increase in moisture content in a warmer atmosphere is also likely to have competing effects. Latent heating has been shown to play a role in invigorating individual ETCs, especially in the downstream development over eastern ocean . However, there is evidence that the overall effect of moistening is to weaken ETCs by improving the efficiency of poleward heat transport and hence reducing the dry baroclinicity . Consistent with this, studies have shown that precipitation is projected to increase in ETCs despite no increase in wind speed intensity of ETCs .	0
14.6.2.2 Regional Projections Large-scale projections of ETCs are assessed in Section 12.4.4.3. This section complements this by presenting a more detailed assessment of regional changes. Individual model projections of regional storm track changes are often comparable with the magnitude of interannual natural variability and so the changes are expected to be relevant for regional climate. However, the magnitude of the response is model dependent at any given location, especially over land . There is also disagreement between different cyclone/storm track identification methods, even when applied to the same data , although in the response to anthropogenic forcing, these differences appear mainly in the statistics of weak cyclones . Conversely, when the same method is applied to different models the spread between the model responses is often larger than the ensemble mean response, especially in the NH . The poleward shift of the SH storm track remains one of the most reproducible projections, yet even here there is considerable quantitative uncertainty. This is partly associated with the varied model biases in jet latitude  although factors such as the varied cloud response may play a role . Many models project a similar poleward shift in the North Pacific , although this is often weaker compared to natural variability and often varies considerably between ensemble members . Poleward shifts are generally less clear at the surface than in the upper troposphere (Yin, 2005; McDonald, 2011; Chang et 1251	0
al., 2012), which reduces their relevance for regional impacts. However, a shift in extreme surface winds is still detectable in the zonal mean, especially in the subtropics and the southern high latitudes . A weakening of the Mediterranean storm track is a particularly robust response  for which increasing static stability is important . In general, the storm track response in summer is weaker than in winter with less consistency between models . The response of the North Atlantic storm track is more complex than a poleward shift in many models, with an increase in storm activity and a downstream extension of the storm track into Europe . In some models this regional response is important , with storm activity over Western Europe increasing by 50%  or by an amount comparable to the natural variability . The return periods of intense cyclones are shortened  with impact on potential wind damage  and economic losses . This response is related to the local minimum in warming in the North Atlantic ocean, which serves to increase the meridional temperature gradient on its southern side . The minimum in warming arises due to the weakening of northward ocean heat transports by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation , and the varying AMOC responses of the models can account for a large fraction of the variance in the Atlantic storm track projections . CMIP5 models show a similar, albeit weaker extension of the storm track towards Europe, flanked by reductions in cyclone activity on both the northern and southern sides . Despite large biases in the mean state, the model responses were found to agree with one another within sampling variation caused by natural variability . Colle et al.  noted similar reductions but also found that the higher resolution CMIP5 models gave more realistic ETC performance in the historical period. The best 7 models were found to give projections of increased 10 to 20% increase in cyclone track density over the eastern USA, including 10 to 40% more intense  cyclones. There is general agreement that there will be a small global reduction in ETC numbers . In individual regions there can be much larger changes which are comparable to natural variations, but these changes are not reproduced by the majority of the models . ETC intensities are particularly sensitive to the method and quantity used to define them, so there is little consensus on changes in intensity . While there are indications that the absolute values of pressure minima deepen in future scenario simulations , this is often associated with large-scale pressure changes rather than changes in the pressure gradients or winds associated with ETCs . The CMIP5 model projections show little evidence of change in the intensity of winds associated with ETCs .	0
response to forcing . Some models with improved representation of the stratosphere have shown a markedly different circulation response in the NH, with consequences for Atlantic/European storm activity in particular . Concerns over the skill of many models in representing both the stratosphere and the ocean mean that confidence in NH storm track projections remains low. Higher horizontal resolution can improve ETC representation, yet there are still relatively few high-resolution global models which have been used for storm track projections . Several studies have used RCMs to simulate storms at high resolution in particular regions. In multi-model experiments over Europe, the ETC response is more sensitive to the choice of driving GCM than the choice of RCM , highlighting the importance of large-scale circulation uncertainties. There has been little work on potential changes to mesoscale storm systems, although it has been suggested that polar lows may reduce in frequency due to an increase in static stability . Higher resolution runs of one climate model also suggest an increase in intensity of autumn ETCs due to increased transitioning of Atlantic hurricanes .	0
The influence of past and future climate change on tropical cyclones is likely to vary by region, but the specific characteristics of the changes are not yet well understood, and the substantial influence of ENSO and other known climate modes on global and regional tropical cyclone activity emphasizes the need for more reliable assessments of future changes in the characteristics of these modes. Recent advances in understanding and phenomenological evidence for shorter-term effects on tropical cyclones from aerosol forcing are providing increasingly greater confidence that anthropogenic forcing has had a measurable effect on tropical cyclone activity in certain regions. Shorter term increases such as those observed in the Atlantic over the past 30 to 40 years appear to be robust and have been hypothesized to be related, in part, to regional external forcing by GHGs and aerosols, but the more steady century-scale trends that may be expected from CO2 forcing alone are much more difficult to assess given the data uncertainty in the available tropical cyclone records. Although projections under 21st century greenhouse warming indicate that it is likely that the global frequency of tropical cyclones will either decrease or remain essentially unchanged, concurrent with a likely increase in both global mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed and rainfall rates, there is low confidence in region-specific projections of frequency and intensity. Still, based on high-resolution modelling studies, the frequency of the most intense storms, which are associated with particularly extensive physical effects, will more likely than not increase substantially in some basins under projected 21st century warming and there is medium confidence that tropical cyclone rainfall rates will increase in every affected region. The global number of ETCs is unlikely to decrease by more than a few percent due to anthropogenic change. A small poleward shift is likely in the SH storm track, but the magnitude is model dependent. There is only medium confidence in projections of storm track shifts in the	0
The PSA pattern is a teleconnection from the tropics to SH extratropics through Rossby wave trains . This pattern induces atmospheric circulation anomalies over South America, affecting extreme precipitation . PSA trends for recent decades depend on the choice of indices and are hence uncertain . The PSA pattern is reproduced in many model simulations . The intensification and westward displacement of the PSA wave pattern in projections of CMIP3 may be related to the increase in frequency and intensity of positive SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific by the end of the 21st century . These perturbations of the PSA characteristics are linked with changes in SACZ dipole precipitation and affect South America precipitation . The PSA pattern occurrence and implications for precipitation increase in the southeastern South America have been associated with the zonally asymmetric part of the global SST change in the equatorial Indian-western Pacific Oceans . Process understanding of the formation of the PSA gives medium confidence that future changes in the mean atmospheric circulation for austral summer will project on the PSA pattern thereby influencing the SACZ and precipitation over southeastern South America. However, the literature is not sufficient to assess more general changes in PSA, and confidence is low in its future projections.	0
The PNA pattern, as defined in Box 2.5, Table 1 and portrayed in Box 2.5, Figure 2 is a prominent mode of atmospheric variability over the North Pacific and the North American land mass. This phenomenon exerts notable influences on the temperature and precipitation variability in these regions . The PNA pattern is related to ENSO events in the tropical Pacific , and also serves as a bridge linking ENSO and NAO variability . The data records indicate a significant positive trend in the wintertime PNA index over the past 60 years . Stoner et al.  have assessed the capability of 22 CMIP3 GCMs in replicating the essential aspects of the observed PNA pattern. Their results indicate that a majority of the models overestimate the fraction of variance explained by the PNA pattern, and that the spatial characteristics of PNA patterns simulated in 14 of the 22 models are in good	0
The Pacific Decadal Oscillation  refers to the leading Empirical Orthogonal Function  of monthly SST anomalies over the North Pacific  from which the globally averaged SST anomalies have been subtracted . It exhibits anomalies of one sign along the west coast of North America and of opposite sign in the western and central North Pacific . The PDO is closely linked to fluctuations in the strength of the wintertime Aleutian Low Pressure System. The time scale of the PDO is around 20 to 30 years, with changes of sign between positive and negative polarities in the 1920s, the late 1940s, the late 1970s and around 2000. The extension of the PDO to the whole Pacific basin is known as the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation . The IPO is nearly identical in form to the PDO in the NH but is defined globally, as a leading EOF  of 13-year lowpass-filtered global SST anomalies  and has substantial amplitude in the tropical and southern Pacific. The time series of the PDO and IPO correlate highly on an annual basis. The PDO/IPO pattern is considered to be the result of internal climate variability  and has not been observed to exhibit a longterm trend. The PDO/IPO is associated with ENSO modulations, with more El Nino activity during the positive PDO/IPO and more La Nina activity during the negative PDO/IPO. At the time of the AR4, little had been published on modelling of the PDO/IPO or of its evolution in future. In a recent study, Furtado et al.  found that the PDO/IPO did not exhibit major changes in spatial or temporal characteristics under GHG warming in most of the 24 CMIP3 models used, although some models indicated a weak shift toward more occurrences of the negative phase of the PDO/IPO by the end of the 21st century . However, given that the models strongly underestimate the PDO/IPO connection with tropical Indo-Pacific SST variations , the credibility of the projections remains uncertain. Furthermore, internal variability is so high that it is hard to detect any forced changes in the Aleutian Low for the next half a century . Therefore confidence is low in projections of future changes in PDO/IPO.	0
increase of SST in the Indian Ocean that contributes to stronger trade winds in the Pacific, one of the processes previously identified with strengthening the TBO . Thus, prediction of decadal variability assessed in Chapter 11 that can be associated, for example, with the IPO  can influence the accuracy of shorter-term predictions of the TBO across the entire Indo-Pacific region , but the relevance for longer time scales is uncertain. Since AR4, little work has been done to document the ability of climate models to simulate the TBO. However, Li et al.  showed that there is an overall improvement in the seasonality of monsoons rainfall related to changes in the TBO from CMIP3 to CMIP5, with most CMIP5 models better simulating both the monsoon timing and the very low rainfall rates outside of the monsoon season . In addition they concluded that the India-Australia link seems to be robust in all models. With regard to possible future behaviour of the TBO, no analysis using multiple GCMs has been made since the AR4. In models that more accurately simulate the TBO in the present-day climate, the TBO strengthens in a future warmer climate . However, as with ENSO  and IOD , internally generated decadal variability complicates the interpretation of such future changes. Therefore, it remains unclear how future changes in the TBO will emerge and how this may influence regional climate in the future. Confidence in the projected future changes in TBO remains low.	0
It has been unclear how the QBO will respond to future climate change related to GHG increase and recovery of stratospheric ozone. Climate models assessed in the AR4 did not simulate the QBO as they lacked the necessary vertical resolution . Recent model studies without using gravity wave parameterization  showed that the QBO period and amplitude may become longer and weaker, and the downward penetration into the lowermost stratosphere may be more curtailed in a warmer climate. This finding is attributed to the effect of increased equatorial upwelling  dominating the effect of increased wave forcing . Two studies with gravity wave parameterization, however, gave conflicting results depending on the simulated changes in the intensity of the Brewer-Dobson circulation . 1254	0
The AMO  is a fluctuation seen in the instrumental SST record throughout the North Atlantic Ocean and is related to variability in the thermohaline circulation . Area-mean North Atlantic SST shows variations with a range of about 0.4C  and a warming of a similar magnitude since 1870. The AMO has a quasi-periodicity of about 70 years, although the approximately 150-year instrumental record possesses only a few distinct phases--warm during approximately 1930-1965 and after 1995, and cool between 1900-1930 and 1965-1995. The phenomenon has also been referred to as `Atlantic Multidecadal Variability' to avoid the implication of temporal regularity. Along with secular trends and Pacific variability, the AMO is one of the principal features of multidecadal variability in the instrumental climate record. The AR4 highlighted a number of important links between the AMO and regional climates. Subsequent research using observational and paleoclimate records, and climate models, has confirmed and expanded upon these connections, such as West African monsoon and Sahel rainfall , summer climate in North America  and Europe , the Arctic , and Atlantic major hurricane frequency . Further, the list of AMO influences around the globe has been extended to include decadal variations in many other regions . Paleo reconstructions of Atlantic temperatures show AMO-like variability well before the instrumental era, as noted in the AR4 . Recent analyses confirm this, and suggest potential for intermittency in AMO variability . Control simulations of climate models run for hundreds or thousands of years also show long-lived Atlantic multi-decadal variability . These lines of evidence suggest that AMO variability will continue into the future. No fundamental changes in the characteristics of North Atlantic multi-decadal variability in the 21st century are seen in CMIP3 models . Many studies have diagnosed a trend towards a warm North Atlantic in recent decades additional to that implied by global climate forcings . It is unclear exactly when the current warm phase of the AMO will terminate, but may occur within the next few decades, leading to a cooling influence in the North Atlantic and offsetting some of the effects characterizing global warming . Some similarity in the shape of the instrumental time series of global and NH mean surface temperatures and the AMO has long been noted. By removing an estimate of the effect of interannual variability phe	0
Regional climate projections are generally more uncertain than projections of global mean temperature but the sources of uncertainty are similar  yet differ in relative importance. For example, natural variability , aerosol forcing  and land use/cover changes  all become more important sources of uncertainty on a regional scale. Regional climate assessments incur additional uncertainty due to the cascade of uncertainty through the hierarchy of models needed to generate local information . Calibration  of model output to match local observations is an additional important source of uncertainty in regional climate projections , which should be considered when interpreting the regional projections. Therefore, the model spread shown in Annex 1 should not be interpreted as the final uncertainty in the observable regional climate change response.	0
Literature is generally insufficient to assess future changes in behaviour of the PNA, PSA, TBO, QBO and PDO/IPO. Confidence in the projections of changes in these modes is therefore low. However, process understanding of the formation of the PSA gives medium confidence that future changes in the mean atmospheric circulation for austral summer will project on the PSA pattern thereby influencing the SACZ and precipitation over Southeastern South America. Paleoclimate reconstructions and long model simulations indicate that the AMO is unlikely to change its behaviour in the future as the mean climate changes. However, natural fluctuations in the AMO over the coming few decades are likely to influence regional climates at least as strongly as will human-induced changes.	0
The following sections assess future climate projections for several regions, and relate them, where possible, to projected changes in the major climate phenomena assessed in Sections 14.2 to 14.7. The regional climate change assessments are mainly of mean surface air temperature and mean precipitation based primarily on multi-model ensemble projections from general circulation models. Reference is made to the appropriate projection maps from CMIP5  presented in Annex I: Atlas of Global and Regional Climate Projections. Annex I uses smaller sub-regions similar to those introduced by SREX . Table 14.1 presents a quantitative summary of the regional area averages over three projection periods  for the RCP4.5 scenario. The 26 land regions assessed here are presented in Seneviratne et al., 2012, page 12 and the coordinates can be found from their online Appendix 3.A. Added to this are six additional regions containing the two polar regions, the Caribbean, Indian Ocean and Pacific Island States . Table 14.1 identifies the smaller sub-domains grouped within the somewhat large regions that are discussed in Sections 14.8.2 to 14.8.15. Tables for RCP2.6, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios are presented in Supplementary Material Tables 14.SM.1a to 14.SM.1c. For continental-scale regions, projected changes in mean precipitation between  and  are compared in two generations of models forced under two comparable emission scenarios: RCP4.5 in CMIP5 versus A1B in CMIP3. In contrast to the Annex, the seasons here are chosen differently for each region so as to best capture the regional features such as monsoons. Downscaling issues are illustrated in panels showing results from an ensemble of high-resolution time-slice experiments with the Meteorological	0
Table 14.2 summarizes the assessed confidence in the ability of CMIP5 models to represent regional scale present-day climate , the main controlling phenomena for weather and climate in that region and the assessed resulting confidence in the future projections. There is generally less confidence in projections of precipitation than of temperature. For example, in Annex I, the temperature projections for 2081-2100 are almost always above the model estimates of natural variability, whereas the precipitation projections less frequently rise above natural variability. Although some projections are robust for reasons that are well understood , many other regions have precipitation projections that vary in sign and magnitude across the models. These issues are further discussed in Section 12.4.5.2. Details on how the confidence table is constructed are found in the Supplementary Material. Credibility in regional climate change projections is increased if it is possible to find key drivers of the change that are known to be well-simulated and well-projected by climate models. Table 14.3 summarizes the assessment of how major climate phenomena might be relevant for future regional climate change. For each entry in the table, the relevance is based on an assessment of confidence in future change in the phenomenon and the confidence in how the phenomenon influences regional climate. For example, NAO is assigned high relevance  for the Arctic region because NAO is known to influence the Arctic and there is high confidence that the NAO index will increase in response to anthropogenic forcing. If there is low confidence in how a phenomenon might change  but high confidence that it has a strong regional impact, then the cell in the table is assigned medium relevance . It can be seen from the table that there are many cases where major phenomena are assessed to have high  or medium  relevance for future regional climate change. See Supplementary Material Section 14.SM.6.1 for more details on how this relevance table was constructed. 1255	0
FAQ 14.2 | How Are Future Projections in Regional Climate Related to Projections of Global Means? The relationship between regional climate change and global mean change is complex. Regional climates vary strongly with location and so respond differently to changes in global-scale influences. The global mean change is, in effect, a convenient summary of many diverse regional climate responses. Heat and moisture, and changes in them, are not evenly distributed across the globe for several reasons: * External forcings vary spatially . * Surface conditions vary spatially, for example, land/sea contrast, topography, sea surface temperatures, soil moisture content. * Weather systems and ocean currents redistribute heat and moisture from one region to another. Weather systems are associated with regionally important climate phenomena such as monsoons, tropical convergence zones, storm tracks and important modes of climate variability , North Atlantic Oscillation , Southern Annular Mode , etc.). In addition to modulating regional warming, some climate phenomena are also projected to change in the future, which can lead to further impacts on regional climates . Projections of change in surface temperature and precipitation show large regional variations . Enhanced surface warming is projected to occur over the high-latitude continental regions and the Arctic ocean, 	0
while over other oceans and lower latitudes changes are closer to the global mean . For example, warming near the Great Lakes area of North America is projected to be about 50% greater than that of the global mean warming. Similar large regional variations are also seen in the projected changes of more extreme temperatures . Projected changes in precipitation are even more regionally variable than changes in temperature , caused by modulation from climate phenomena such as the monsoons and tropical convergence zones. Near-equatorial latitudes are projected to have increased mean precipitation, while regions on the poleward edges of the subtropics are projected to have reduced mean precipitation. Higher latitude regions are projected to have increased mean precipitation and in particular more extreme precipitation from extratropical cyclones. Polar regions illustrate the complexity of processes involved in regional climate change. Arctic warming is projected to increase more than the global mean, mostly because the melting of ice and snow produces a regional feedback by allowing more heat from the Sun to be absorbed. This gives rise to further warming, which encourages more melting of ice and snow. However, the projected warming over the Antarctic continent and surrounding oceans is less marked in part due to a stronger positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode. Westerly winds over the midlatitude southern oceans have increased over recent decades, driven by the combined effect of loss of stratospheric ozone over Antarctica, and changes in the atmosphere's temperature structure related to increased greenhouse gas concentrations. This change in the Southern Annular Mode is well captured by climate models and has the effect of reducing atmospheric heat transport to the Antarctic continent. Nevertheless, the Antarctic Peninsula is still warming rapidly, because it extends far enough northwards to be influenced by the warm air masses of the westerly wind belt.	0
This section is concerned with temperature and precipitation dimensions of Arctic climate change, and their links to climate phenomena. The reader is referred elsewhere for information on sea ice loss , and projections of sea ice change . Arctic climate is affected by three modes of variability: NAO , PDO  and AMO . The NAO index correlates positively with temperatures in the northeastern Eurasian sector, and correlates negatively with temperatures in the Baffin Bay and Canadian Archipelago, but exhibits little relationship with central Arctic temperatures . The PDO plays a role in temperature variability of Alaska and the Yukon . The AMO is positively associated with SST throughout the Arctic  . ETCs are also mainly responsible for winter precipitation in the region . The surface and lower troposphere in the Arctic and surrounding land areas show regional warming over the past three decades of about 1C per decade--significantly greater than the global mean trend . According to temperature reconstructions, this signal is highly unusual: Temperatures averaged over the Arctic over the past few decades are significantly higher than any seen over the past 2000 years . Temperatures 11 ka were greater than the 20th century mean, but this is probably a strongly forced signal, since summer solar radiation was 9% greater than present (Miller et al.,	0
2010). Finally, warmer temperatures have been sustained in pan-Arctic land areas where a declining NAO over the past decade ought to have caused cooling . Since AR4, evidence has also emerged that precipitation has trended upward in most pan-Arctic land areas over the past few decades , though the evidence remains mixed . Increasing ETC activity over the Canadian Arctic has also been observed . Since AR4, there has been progress in adapting RCMs for polar applications . These models have been evaluated with regard to their ability to simulate Arctic clouds, surface heat fluxes, and boundary layer processes . They have been used to improve simulations of Arctic-specific climate processes, such as glacial mass balance . A few regional models have been used for Arctic climate change projections . For information on GCM quality in the Arctic, see Chapter 9 and the brief summary of assessed confidence in the CMIP5 models in Table 14.2. The CMIP5 model simulations exhibit an ensemble-mean polar amplified warming, especially in winter, similar to CMIP3 model simulations . For RCP4.5, ensemble-mean winter warming rises to 5.0C over pan-Arctic land areas by the end of the 21st century , and about 7.0C over the Arctic Sea . Throughout the century, the warming exceeds simulated estimates of internal variability . The RCP4.5 ensemble-mean warming is more modest in JJA , 1257	0
reaching about 2.2C by century's end over pan-Arctic land areas, and 1.5C over the Arctic Sea. The summer warming exceeds variability estimates by about mid-century . These simulated anthropogenic seasonal warming patterns match qualitatively the observed warming patterns over the past six decades , and the observed warming patterns are likely to be at least partly anthropogenic in origin . Given the magnitude of future projected changes relative to variability, and the presence of anthropogenic signals already, it is likely future Arctic surface temperature changes will continue to be strongly influenced by the anthropogenic forcing over the coming decades. The CMIP5 models robustly project precipitation increases in the pan-Arctic  region over the 21st century, as did their CMIP3 counterparts . Under the RCP4.5 scenario, the cold season, ensemble mean precipitation increases about 25% by the century's end , due to enhanced precipitation in ETCs . However, this signal does not rise consistently above the noise of simulated variability until mid 21st century . During the warm season, precipitation increases are smaller, about 15% , though these signals also rise above variability by mid 21st century . The inter-model spread in the precipitation increase is generally as large as the ensemble mean signal itself , so the magnitude of the future increase is uncertain. However, since nearly all models project a large precipitation increase rising above the variability year-round, it is likely the pan-Arctic region will experience a statistically significant increase in precipitation by mid-century . The small projected increase in the NAO is likely to affect Arctic precipitation  patterns in the coming century , though the importance of these signals relative to anthropogenic signals described here is unclear. In summary: It is likely Arctic surface temperature changes will be strongly influenced by anthropogenic forcing over the coming decades dominating natural variability such as induced by NAO. It is likely the pan-Arctic region will experience a significant increase in precipitation by mid-century due mostly to enhanced precipitation in ETCs.	0
2007; Vimont and Kossin, 2007; Smirnov and Vimont, 2011). ETCs are also mainly responsible for winter precipitation, especially in the northern half of NA. See Table 14.3 for a summary of this information. A general surface warming over NA has been documented over the last century . It is particularly large over Alaska and northern Western NA during winter and spring and the northern part of Eastern NA during summer . There is also a cooling tendency over Central and Eastern NA  during spring, though it is absent in lower tropospheric temperature . The warming has coincided with a general decline in NA snow extent and depth . Consistent with surface temperature trends, temperature extremes also exhibit secular changes. Cold days and nights have decreased in the last half century, while warm days and nights have increased . These changes are especially apparent for nightly extremes . It is unclear whether there have been mean precipitation trends over the last 50 years . However, precipitation extremes increased, especially over Central and Eastern NA . Table 14.2 provides an assessment of GCM quality for simulations of temperature, precipitation, and main phenomena in NA's regions. Regarding regional modelling experiments since AR4, biases have decreased somewhat as resolutions increase. The North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program created a simulation suite for NA at 50-km resolution. When forced by reanalyses, this suite generally reproduces climate variability within observational error .Other regional modelling experiments covering parts or all of NA have shown improvements as resolution increases , including for extremes . Bias reductions are large for snowpack in topographically complex Western NA, as revealed by 2- to 20-km resolution regional simulations . Thus there has been substantial progress since AR4 in understanding the value of regional modelling in simulating NA climate. The added value of using regional models to simulate climate change is discussed in Section 9.6.6.	0
The climate of North America  is affected by the following phenomena: NAO , ENSO , PNA , PDO , NAMS , TCs and ETCs . The NAO affects temperature and precipitation over Eastern NA during winter . Positive PNA brings warmer temperatures to northern Western NA and Alaska in winter, cooler temperatures to the southern part of Eastern NA, and dry conditions to much of Eastern NA . The PNA can also be excited by ENSO-related SST anomalies . The PDO is linked to decadal climate anomalies resembling those of the PNA. The NAMS brings excess summer rainfall to Central America and Mexico and the southern portion of Western NA . TCs also impact the Gulf Coast and Eastern NA . The AMM and AMO may affect their frequency and intensity (Landsea et al., 1999; Goldenberg et al., 2001; Cassou et al., 2007; Emanuel, 1258	0
NA warming patterns in RCP4.5 CMIP5 projections are generally similar to those of CMIP3 . In winter, warming is greatest in Alaska, Canada, and Greenland , while in summer, maximum warming shifts south, to Western, Central, and Eastern NA. Examining near-term  CMIP5 projections of the less sensitive models , the warming generally exceeds natural variability estimates. Exceptions are Alaska, parts of Western, Central, and Eastern NA, and Canada and Greenland during winter, when natural variability linked to wintertime storms is particularly large. By 2046-2065, warming in all regions exceeds the natural variability estimate for all models. Thus it is very likely the warming signal will be large compared to natural variability in all NA regions throughout the year by mid-century. This warming generally leads to a two- to four fold increase in simulated heat wave frequency over the 21st century .	0
Anthropogenic climate change may also bring systematic cold-season precipitation changes. As with previous models, CMIP5 projections generally agree in projecting a winter precipitation increase over the northern half of NA . This is associated with increased atmospheric moisture, increased moisture convergence, and a poleward shift in ETC activity . The change is consistent with CMIP3 model projections of positive NAO trends . Winter precipitation increases extend southward into the USA  but with decreasing strength relative to natural variability. This behaviour is qualitatively reproduced in higher resolution simulations . Warm-season precipitation also exhibits significant increases in Alaska, northern Canada, and Eastern NA by century's end . However, CMIP5 models disagree on the sign of the precipitation change over the rest of NA , consistent with CMIP3 results . One set of high resolution simulatons  shows a tendency towards more precipitation than either CMIP3 or CMIP5 models , suggesting the simulated warm-season precipitation change in the region may be resolution-dependent. Future precipitation changes associated with	0
the NAMS are likewise uncertain, though there is medium confidence the phenomenon will move to later in the annual cycle . As there is medium confidence tropical cyclones will be associated with greater rainfall rates, the Gulf and East coasts of NA may be impacted by greater precipitation when tropical cyclones occur . CMIP3 models showed a 21st century precipitation decrease across much of southwestern NA, accompanied by a robust evaporation increase characteristic of mid-latitude continental warming  and an increase in drought frequency . When downscaled, CMIP3 models showed less drying in the region  and an extreme precipitation increase, despite overall drying . CMIP5 models do not consistently show such a precipitation decrease in this region . This is one of the few emerging differences between the two ensembles in climate projections over NA. However, the CMIP5 models still show a strong decrease in soil moisture here , due to increasing evaporation. In summary, it is very likely that by mid-century the anthropogenic warming signal will be large compared to natural variability such as that stemming from the NAO, ENSO, PNA, PDO, and the NAMS in all	0

14.8.4 Central America and Caribbean The Central America and the Caribbean  region is affected by several phenomena, including the ITCZ , NAMS , ENSO  and TCs . The annual cycle results from air-sea interactions over the Western Hemisphere warm pool in the tropical eastern north Pacific and the Intra Americas Seas . The Caribbean Low Level Jet is a key element of the region's summer climate  and is controlled by the size and intensity of the Western Hemisphere warm pool . It is also modulated by SST gradients between the eastern equatorial Pacific and tropical Atlantic . ENSO is the main driver of climate variability, with El Nino being associated with dry conditions and La Nina with wet conditions . Other teleconnection patterns, such as the NAO  and the strength of boreal winter convection over the Amazon,	0
Because inter-decadal climate variations can be large in the CAC region, precipitation trends must be interpreted carefully. From 1950 to 2003, negative trends were seen in several data sets in the Caribbean region and parts of Central America . However, regarding secular trends , this signal was identified only in the Caribbean region . Prolonged dry or wet periods are related to decadal variability of the adjacent Pacific and Atlantic , and the intensity of easterlies over the region. For instance, increased easterly surface winds over Puerto Rico from 1950 to 2000 disrupted a pattern of inland moisture convergence, leading to a dramatic precipitation decrease . Table 14.2 provides an overall assessment of GCM quality for simulations of temperature, precipitation and main phenomena in the CAC sub-regions. Annual cycles of temperature and precipitation are well	0

CMIP3 models generally projected a precipitation reduction over much of the Caribbean region, consistent with the observed negative trend since 1950 . The subtropics are generally expected to dry as global climate warms , but in both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models the CAC region shows the greatest drying. Future drying may also be related to strengthening of the Caribbean Low-Level Jet  and subsidence over the Caribbean region associated with warmer SSTs in the tropical Pacific than Atlantic . A high-resolution regional Ocean GCM using a CMIP3 ensemble for boundary conditions confirms that the Intra American Seas circulation weakens by similar rate as the reduction in Atlantic Meridional Overturning . This weakening causes the Gulf of Mexico to warm less than other oceans.	0
Downscaling experiments for the region have shown a mid-21st century warming between 2C and 3C . Precipitation decreases over most of the CAC region, similar to the signal in driving global models . However, only a few downscaling studies took into account key elements of the region's climate, such as easterly wave activity, TCs, or interannual variability mechanisms linked to ENSO . By century's end, CMIP5 models project greatest warming in the CAC region in JJA. Warming is projected to be larger over Central America than the Caribbean in summer and winter . From October to March, ensemble mean projections indicate precipitation decrease in northern Central America, including Mexico. In the Caribbean precipitation is projected to decrease in the south  but to increase in the north . From April to September, the projected zone of precipitation reduction expands over the entire CAC region, and this signal is generally larger than the models' estimates of natural variability . Precipitation changes projected by CMIP3, CMIP5 and a high-resolution model show a similar reduction in parts of Mexico and the southern Caribbean in DJFM, and in Central America and the Caribbean in JJAS . The CMIP5 ensemble shows greater agreement in the DJFM precipitation increase in the northern Caribbean sector than CMIP3. These projected changes are also reflected in Table 14.1. Figures AI.26, AI.27 and Figure 14.19 suggest an intensification and southward displacement of the East Pacific ITCZ, which can contribute to drying in southern Central America . ENSO will continue to influence CAC climate, but changes in ENSO frequency or intensity remain uncertain . Projected drier conditions may also be related to decreased frequency of TCs, though the associated rainfall rate of these systems are higher in future projections . In summary, owing to model agreement on projections and the degree of consistency with observed trends, it is likely warm-season	0
Positive minimum temperature trends have been observed in SA . Glacial retreat in the tropical Andes was observed in the last three decades . In contrast to the warming over the continental interior, a prominent but localized coastal cooling was detected during the past 30 to 50 years, extending from central Peru  to northern  and central Chile . Observed precipitation changes include a significant increase in precipitation during the 20th century over the southern sector of southeastern SA, a negative trend in SACZ continental area , a negative trend in mean precipitation and precipitation extremes in central-southern Chile, and a positive trend in southern Chile . Other detected changes include positive extreme precipitation trends in southeastern SA, central-northern Argentina and northwestern Peru and Ecuador . Table 14.2 provides an overall assessment of GCM quality for simulations of temperature, precipitation and main phenomena in the sub-regions of SA. In general, GCM results are consistent with observed temperature tendencies . Trends toward warmer nights in CMIP3 models  are consistent with observed trends. CMIP3 models, however, do not simulate the cooling ocean and warming land trends observed in the last 30 years along subtropical western SA noted above. The number of warm nights in SA is well represented in CMIP5 simulations . CMIP5 models reproduce the annual cycle of precipitation over SA, though the multi-model mean underestimates rainfall over some areas . In tropical SA, rainy season precipitation is better reproduced in the CMIP5 ensemble than CMIP3 . CMIP3 models were able to simulate extreme precipitation indices over SA , but CMIP5 models improved them globally . CMIP5 also improved simulations of precipitation indices in the SAMS region . The main precipitation features are well represented by regional models in several areas of SA . However, regional models underestimate daily precipitation intensity in the La 1261	0

projections for the end of the twenty-first century  show a precipitation increase from October to March over the southern part of Southeast Brazil and the La Plata Basin, the extreme south of Chile, the northwest coast of SA, and the Atlantic ITCZ, extending to a small area of the northeastern Brazil coast . Reduced October to March rainfall is projected in the extreme northern region of SA, eastern Brazil, and central Chile. In eastern Amazonia and northeastern Brazil, CMIP5 models show both drying and moistening. This uncertainty can also be seen in Table 14.1. Figure 14.20 confirms that changes in northwestern, southwestern and southeastern SA are consistent among CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles and a high-resolution model ensemble, which gives more confidence in these results. However, in eastern Amazonia and northeast and eastern	0
Brazil, there is less agreement. Results from high-resolution or regional models forced by CMIP3 models provides further indication the projected changes are robust. A high-resolution regional model ensemble projects precipitation increases during austral summer over the La Plata Basin region, northwestern SA and southernmost Chile, and a decrease over northern SA, eastern Amazonia, eastern Brazil, central Chile and the Altiplano . Other regional models also project a precipitation increase over the Peruvian coast and Ecuador and a reduction in the Amazon Basin . From April to September, the CMIP5 ensemble projects precipitation increases over the La Plata Basin and northwestern SA near the coast . In contrast, a reduction is projected for northeast 1263	0
Brazil and eastern Amazonia. Precipitation is projected to decrease in Central Chile, but to increase over extreme southern areas. In CMIP3 models, a precipitation reduction in the central Andes resulted from a moisture transport decrease from the continental interior to the Altiplano . CMIP3 and CMIP5 models are consistent in projecting drier conditions in eastern Amazonia during the dry season and wetter conditions in western Amazonia . The Amazon forest's future is discussed in Section 12.5.5.6.1. Areas of maximum change in CMIP5 are consistent with those of CMIP3 in JJA, agreeing also with a high-resolution model ensemble . Increased precipitation in southeastern SA is projected by a high-resolution model ensemble in all four seasons . The austral winter precipitation increase over the La Plata Basin and southern Chile, and the reduction in eastern Amazonia and northeast Brazil, are also projected by RCMs  as in CMIP5 models. A relevant result from a RCM is the precipitation decrease over most of SA north of 20S in austral spring, suggesting a longer dry season . Note that average CMIP5 spatial values in Table 14.1 are consistent with changes seen in the maps, unless for the west coast of SA, where there are spatial variations within the area and the values do not reflect the changes.	0
Regional model projections and a high-resolution model ensemble indicate an increase in the number of consecutive dry days in northeastern SA . An increase in heavy precipitation events over almost the entire continent, especially Amazonia, southern Brazil and northern Argentina, is projected by a high-resolution model ensemble  and in s ubtropical areas of South America by regional models . Seneviratne et al.  indicated low to medium confidence in CMIP3 SA precipitation trends. However, the increased ability of CMIP5 models to represent extremes  provides higher confidence in the signals discussed above , consistent with global changes in land areas .	0
Precipitation changes projected over SA are consistent with El Nino influences, for example, rainfall increase over southeastern and northwestern SA and decrease over eastern Amazonia. However, CMIP3 models could not represent certain features of ENSO well  and there is no consensus about future ENSO behaviour  even with CMIP5 results . As the various types of ENSO produce different impacts on SA , future ENSO effects remain uncertain. It is very likely that ENSO remains the dominant mode of interannual variability in the future . Therefore, regions in SA currently influenced by Pacific SST will continue to experience ENSO effects on precipitation and temperature.	0
In summary, it is very likely temperatures will increase over the whole continent, with greatest warming projected in southern Amazonia. It is likely there will be an increase  in frequency of warm  nights in most regions. It is very likely precipitation will increase in the southern sector of southeastern and northwestern SA, and decrease in Central Chile and extreme north of the continent. It is very likely that less rainfall will occur in eastern Amazonia, northeast and eastern Brazil during the dry season. However, in the rainy season there is medium confidence in the precipitation changes over these regions. There is high confidence in an increase of precipitation extremes.	0
Recent 1981-2012 trends in annual mean temperature in each subregion exceed the global mean land trend as can be inferred from Figure 2.22. Consistent with previous AR4 conclusions , recent studies of extreme events  point to a very likely increase of the number of warm days and nights, and decrease of the number of cold days and nights, since 1950 in Europe. Heat waves can be amplified by drier soil conditions resulting from warming . Several studies  also indicate general increases in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation especially in winter during the last four decades however there are inconsistencies between studies, regions and seasons. The ability of climate models to simulate the climate in this region has improved in many important aspects since AR4 . Particularly relevant for this region are increased model resolution and a better representation of the land surface processes in many of the models that participated in the recent CMIP5 experiment. Table 14.2 provides an assessment of the CMIP5 quality for simulations of temperature, precipitation, and main phenomena in the region. The CMIP5 projections reveal warming in all seasons for the three sub-regions, while precipitation projections are more variable across sub-regions and seasons. In the winter half year , NEU and CEU are projected to have increased mean precipitation associated with increased atmospheric moisture, increased moisture convergence and	0
intensification in ETC activity  and no change or a moderate reduction in the MED. In the summer half year  , NEU and CEU mean precipitation are projected to have only small changes whereas there is a notable reduction in MED . Figure 14.22 illustrates that the precipitation changes are broadly consistent with the findings CMIP3. High-resolution projections from the Japanese high-resolution model ensemble also agree with these findings and are consistent with downscaling results from coordinated multi-model GCM/RCM experiments . In general, regional climate change amplitudes for temperature and precipitation follow the global warming amplitude although modulated both by changes in the large-scale circulation and by regional feedback processes , which confirms assessments in AR4 . Some new investigations have focussed on the uncertainties associated with model projections. A large ensemble of RCM-GCM shows that the temperature response is robust in spite of a considerable uncertainty related to choice of model combination  and sam-	0
pling , even for the 2021-2050 time frame . Other studies based on CMIP3 projections suggest that GHG-forced changes in the MED are likely to become distinguishable from the `noise' created by internal decadal variations in decades beyond 2020-2030 . It has been also shown using an ensemble of RCM simulations that the removal of NAO-related variability leads to an earlier emergence of change in seasonal mean temperatures for some regions in Europe . Hence, in the near term, decadal predictability is likely to be critically dependent on the regional impacts of modes of variability `internal' to the climate system . However, it has been shown that NAO trends do not account for a large fraction of the long-term future change in mean temperature or precipitation  and that largescale atmospheric circulation changes in CMIP5 models are not the main driver of the warming projected in Europe by the end of the century . Therefore, changes in climate phenomena contribute to the uncertainty in the near-term projections rather than long-term changes in this region , further supporting the credibility in model projection . Recent studies have clearly identified a possible amplification of temperature extremes by changes in soil moisture (Jaeger and Seneviratne,	0

2010; Hirschi et al., 2011), acting as a mechanism that further magnifies the intensity and frequency of heat waves given the projected enhance of summer drying conditions. This is in line with the assessed results presented in SREX . At the other end of the spectrum, studies indicate that European winter variability may be related to sea ice reductions in the Barents-Kara Sea  and CMIP5 models in projections for the future in general exhibit a similar relation until the summer sea ice has almost disappeared . Although the mechanism behind this relation remains unclear this suggests that cold winters in Europe will continue to occur in coming decades, despite an overall warming. Although climate models have improved fidelity in simulating aspects of regional climates over Europe and the Mediterranean, the spread in projections is still substantial, partly due to large amounts of natural variability in this region , besides the inherent model deficiencies . In summary, there is high confidence in model projections of mean temperature in this region. It is very likely that temperatures will continue to increase throughout the 21st century over all of Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is likely that winter mean temperature will rise more in NEU than in CEU or MED, whereas summer warming will likely be more intense in MED and CEU than in NEU. The length, frequency, and/or intensity of warm spells or heat waves are assessed to be very likely to increase throughout the whole region. There is medium confidence in an annual mean precipitation increase in NEU and CEU, while a decrease is likely in MED summer mean precipitation.	0
Sub-Saharan Sahelian climate is dominated by the monsoonal system that brings rainfall to the region during only one season . Most of the rain between May/June and September comes from mesoscale `squall line' systems that travel short distances in their lifetime , and whose distribution is somewhat modified by the synoptic scale African Easterly Wave . The onset of the rainy season in West Africa is a key parameter triggering changes in the vegetation and surface properties, that implies feedbacks to the local atmospheric heat and moisture cycle. The length and frequency of dry spells as well as the length or cumulated rainfall of the season also affect this. All are affected by a large 1266	0
interannual variability . When evaluating models their ability to reproduce such characteristics of the African monsoon is essential. A large effect of natural multi-decadal SST and warming of the oceans on Sahel rainfall is very likely . East Africa experiences a semi-annual rainfall cycle, driven by the ITCZ movement across the equator. Direct links between the region's rainfall and ENSO have been demonstrated  and references therein), but variations in Indian Ocean SST  are recognized as the dominant driver of east African rainfall variability . This feature acts to enhance rainfall through either anomalous low-level easterly flow of moist air into the continent , or a weakening of the low-level westerly flow over the northern Indian Ocean that transports moisture away from the continent . Although the effect of the IOD is evident in the short rainy season, Shongwe et al.  do not find a similar relationship for the long rains. Williams and Funk , however, argue for a reduction in the long rains over Kenya and Ethiopia in response to warmer Indian Ocean SSTs. Variability in southern Africa's climate is strongly influenced by its adjacent oceans  as well as by ENSO . Although it is generally observed that El Nino events correspond to conditions of below-average rainfall over much of southern Africa  the ENSO teleconnection is not linear, but rather has complex influence in which a number of regimes of local rainfall response can be identified . The extreme southwestern parts of southern Africa receive rainfall in austral winter brought by mid-latitude frontal systems mostly associated with passing ETCs, but the majority of the region experiences a single summer rainfall season occurring between November and April. A semi-permanent zone of sub-tropical convergence is a major contributor to summer rainfall in sub-tropical southern Africa . Because of its exceptional magnitude and its clear link to global SST, 20th century decadal rainfall variability in the Sahel is a test of GCMs ability to produce realistic long-term changes in tropical precipitation. Despite biases in the region  the CMIP3 coupled models overall can capture the observed correlation between Sahel rainfall and basin-wide area averaged SST variability  even though individual models may fail, especially at interannual time scales . Recently, Ackerley et al.  used a perturbed physics ensemble and reached a similar result for the role of atmospheric sulphate, confirming previous results . Since AR4, only limited information about improved performance has been documented and only in WAF have major efforts been focussing on relating model behaviour with ability to simulate local climate processes in such details. However, in a comparative study of the ability of CMIP3 and CMIP5 to simulate multiple SST-Africa teleconnections, Rowell  found varying degrees of success in simulating these. In particular, no clear indication of an improvement in the CMIP5 models vs. the CMI3 models was identified.	0
In projections of the 21st century, the CMIP3 models produced both significant drying and significant moistening , and the mechanisms by which a model dries or wets the Sahel are not fully understood . At least qualitatively, the CMIP3 ensemble simulates a more robust response during the pre-onset and the demise portion of the rainy season . Rainfall is projected to decrease in the early phase of the seasons--implying a small delay in the main rainy season, but is projected to increase at the end of the season--implying an intensification of late-season rains , although this appears to be less robust in the CMIP5 models . Projections of a change in the timing of the rains is common to other monsoon regions , including southern Africa.	0
The relevance of a local effect is supported by several lines of evidence. There is observational evidence that local soil moisture gradients can trigger convective systems and that these surface contrasts are as important as topography for generating these systems, which bring most of the rain to the region . Additional evidence comes from simulations of future rainfall changes in West Africa by RCMs subject to coupled model-derived boundary conditions , documenting a wetting response of the Sahel to increased GHG in the absence of other forcings. But the relative importance of this effect versus the response to SST trends is not well quantified, mostly due to the limitation of using a single RCM. An evaluation of six GCMs over East Africa by Conway et al.  reveals no clear multi-model trend in mean annual rainfall by the 2080s, but some indications of increased SON and decreased March,	0

April and May  rainfall are noted. They found inconsistency in how the models represent changes in the IOB and consequent changes in rainfall over East Africa. Shongwe et al.  analysed an ensemble of 12 CMIP3 GCMs . They found widespread increases in short season  rainfall including extreme precipitation across the region, with statistically significant ensemble mean increases. For the long rains , similar changes in the sign and magnitude of mean and extreme seasonal rainfall were seen, but model skill in simulating the MAM season is relatively poor. The changes shown for the short rains are consistent with a differential warming of 21st century Indian Ocean SSTs, which leads to a positive IOD-like state . The atmospheric consequence of this is a weakening of the descending branch of the East African Walker Cell and enhancement of low-level moisture convergence over east Africa . In an assessment of 19 CMIP3 models run with the A1B emissions forcing, Giannini et al.  note a tendency toward a persistent El Nino-like pattern  in the equatorial Pacific along with a decrease in rainfall over southern Africa. Dynamical downscaling of a single GCM by Engelbrecht et al.  shows--for the austral winter--an intensification of the southern edge of the subtropical high pressure belt resulting in southward displacement of the mid-latitude systems that bring frontal rain to the south western parts of the continent, thus resulting in decrease in rainfall. The decrease in summer rainfall is consistent with high-resolution  RCM simulations done by Haensler et al.  which indicate widespread reductions in rainfall over southern Africa under the A1B scenario. Shongwe et al.  identified reduction in spring  rainfall throughout the eastern parts of southern Africa. There is good consensus amongst the models used, with the spring anomalies indicating a trend toward later onset of the summer rainy season. Autumn  reductions are shown for most of southern Africa while eastern South Africa experiences no change and eastern parts of southern Africa show a small increase. Table 14.2 provides an overall assessment of CMIP5 quality for simulations of temperature, precipitation, and main phenomena in the different sub-regions of Africa. Overall, confidence in the projected precipitation changes is at best medium. This is owing to the overall modest ability of models to capture the most important phenomena having a strong control on African climates .	0
The ability of climate models to simulate historical climate, its change, and its variability, has improved in many aspects since the AR4 . But for Africa there is no clear evidence that the modest increase in resolution and a better representation of the land surface processes in many CMIP5 models have resulted in marked improvements . The CMIP5 models projection for this century is further warming in all seasons in the considered four sub-regions, while precipitation show some distinct sub-regional and seasonally dependent changes. In the October to March half year all four regions are projected to receive practically unaltered precipitation amounts by 2081-2100, although somewhat elevated in RCP8.5. In the April to September half year SAH, WAF and EAF will experience little change but a quite notable reduction in SAF is projected (see Table 14.1, 1268	0
F igures AI.40 to AI.51). This is consistent with the results from CMIP3 as depicted in Figure 14.23 in the West African monsoon wet season and austral summer. High resolution information provided by the Japanese high-resolution model ensemble also matches this finding. In summary, given models' ability to capture local processes, large scale climate evolution and their linkages, it is very likely that all of Africa will continue to warm during the 21st century. The overall quality of the CMIP5 models imply, that SAH already very dry is very likely to remain very dry. But there is low confidence in projection statements about drying or wetting of WAF. Owing to models' ability to capture the overall monsoonal behaviour, there is medium confidence in projections of a small delay in the rainy season with an increase at the end of the season. There is medium confidence in projections showing little change in mean precipitation in EAF and reduced precipitation in the Austral winter in SAF, as models tend to represent Indian Ocean SST developments with credibility. Likewise, increasing rainfall in EAF is likely for the short rainy season, but low confidence exists in projections regarding drying or wetting in the long rainy season.	0
This area mostly covering the interior of a large continent extending from the Tibetan plateau to the Arctic is mainly influenced by weather systems coming from the west or south, giving some dependency on the AAM  on the one hand and NAO/NAM  on the other, with associated atmospheric blocking as an additional phenomenon of influence related to the latter . In particular, the variability and long-term change of the climate system in central Asia and northern Asia are closely related to variations of the NAO and NAM . As a part of the polar amplification, large warming trends in recent decades are observed in the northern Asian sector . The warming trend was particularly strong in the cold season , with an increase of 2.4C per 50 years in the mid-latitude semi-arid area of Asia, where the annual rainfall is within the range of 200 to 600 mm over the period of 1901-2009 . The observations indicate some increasing trends of heavy precipitation events in northern Asia, but no spatially coherent trends in central Asia . The CMIP5 models generally have difficulties in representing the mean climate expressed as the climatological means of both temperature and precipitation  for the sub-regions represented in this area, which is partly related to the poor resolution unable to resolve the complex mountainous terrain dominating this region. But the scarceness of observational data and issues related to how these best can be compared with coarse resolution models adds to the uncertainty regarding model quality. The model projections presented in AR4  indicated strong warming in northern Asia during winter and in central Asia during summer. Precipitation was projected to increase throughout the year in northern Asia with the largest fractional increase during winter. For central Asia, a majority of the CMIP3 models projected decreasing	0

14.8.9 With an RCM Sato et al.  projected precipitation decreases over northern Mongolia and increases over southern Mongolia in July. Soil moisture over Mongolia decreases in July as a result of the combined effect of decreased precipitation and increased potential evaporation due to rising surface temperature. In North Asia, all CMIP5 models projects an increase in precipitation in the winter half year, and summer half year precipitation is also projected to increase . In Central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau, model agreement is lower on changes both for winter and summer precipitation .

Summer is the rainy season for East Asia. The Meiyu-Changma-Baiu rain band is the defining feature of East Asian summer climate, extending from eastern China through central Japan . The summer rain band is anchored by the subtropical westerly jet , and located on the northwestern flank of the western North Pacific subtropical high . The wintertime circulation is characterized by monsoonal northerlies between the Siberian High and the Aleutian Low. Both the East Asian summer and winter monsoon circulations have experienced an inter-decadal scale weakening after the 1970s due to natural variability of the coupled climate system, leading to enhanced 1269	0

mean and extreme precipitation along the Yangtze River Valley  but deficient mean precipitation in North China in summer , and a warmer climate in winter. The observed monsoon circulation changes are partly reproduced by GCMs driven by PDO-related SST patterns but the quality of precipitation simulation is poor . In AR4, the regional warming is projected to be above the global mean in East Asia . "It is very likely that heat waves/hot spells in summer will be of longer duration, more intense and more frequent, but very cold days are very likely to decrease in frequency. The precipitation is likely to increase in both boreal winter and summer, while the frequency of intense precipitation events is very likely to increase. Extreme rainfall and winds associated with tropical cyclones are likely to increase". CMIP5 results support many of these assessments.	0
in the winter half year . CMIP3 models projections indicated a decrease of winter precipitation extending northeastward from South China Sea to south of Japan under SRES A1B scenario, changes seen in CMIP5 projections but with smaller spatial coverage . An increase of extreme precipitation is projected over East Asia in a warmer climate . A high-resolution model projects an increase of Meiyu precipitation in May through July, Changma precipitation over Korean peninsula in May, and Baiu precipitation over Japan in July , and an increase of heavy precipitation over East Asia under SRES A1B scenario . CMIP3 models project a late withdrawal of Baiu , as has been observed in eastern and western Japan . There is a significant increase in mean, daily maximum and minimum temperatures in southeastern China, associated with a decrease in the number of frost days and an increase in the heat wave duration under SRES A2 scenario . The CMIP5 model projections also indicate an increase of temperature in both boreal winter and summer over East Asia for RCP4.5 . A decrease of the annual and seasonal maximum wind speeds is found under SRES A2 scenario due to both the reduced intensity of cold waves and the reduced intensity of the winter monsoons .	0
The future warming patterns simulated by RCMs essentially follow those of the driving GCMs . For summer precipitation, however, RCM downscaling usually shows different regional details due to more realistic topographic forcing than in GCMs . The uncertainty of precipitation projection in eastern China is larger than that in western China . RCM downscaling indicates that both the seasonal mean summer rainfall and extreme precipitation around Japan Islands are projected to increase . Projections with a 5-km RCM show that the heaviest hourly precipitation is projected to increase even in the near future  when temperature increase is modest . A southwest expansion of the subtropical anticyclone over the northwestern Pacific Ocean associated with El Nino-like mean state changes in the Pacific and a dry air intrusion in the mid-troposphere from the Asian continent gives a favourable condition for intense precipitation in the Baiu season in Japan . Increased water vapour supply from the south of the Baiu front and an intensified frontal zone with intense mean updrafts contribute to the increased occurrence of intense daily precipitation during the late Baiu season . In summary, based on CMIP5 model projections, there is medium confidence that with an intensified East Asian summer monsoon, summer precipitation over East Asia will increase . Under RCP4.5 scenario, precipitation increase is likely over East Asia during the Meiyu-Changma-Baiu season in May to July, and precipitation extremes are very likely to increase over the eastern Asian continent in all seasons and over Japan in summer. However, there is only low confidence in more specific details of the projected changes due to the limited skill of CMIP5 models in simulating monsoon features such as the East Asian monsoon rainband .	0
14.8.10 West Asia This region extends from the Mediterranean to the western fringes of South Asia, covering the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula and includes large areas of barren desert. The climate over this region varies from arid to semi-arid and precipitation is primarily received in the cold season. The western part of the region is on the margin of Atlantic and Mediterranean influences, primarily the NAO  during winter months, and indirectly the monsoon heat low  in the summer months. Precipitation in this region comes largely from passing ETCs . Land-falling TCs  that occasionally influence the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula are notable extreme events. Pacific Ocean variability, associated with ENSO , and the ITCZ  are also known to impact weather and climate in different parts of West Asia. In recent decades, there appears to be a weak but non-significant downward trend in mean precipitation , although intense weather events appear to be increasing . In contrast, upward temperature trends are notable	0
and robust . The ability of climate models to simulate historical climate, its change and its variability, has improved in many important aspects since the AR4 . CMIP5 models tend to be able to reproduce the basic climate state of the region as well as the main phenomena affecting it with some fidelity , but the region is at the fringes of the influence of different drivers of European, Asian and African climates and remains poorly analysed in the peer-reviewed literature with respect to climate model performances. The CMIP5 model projections for this century are for further warming in all seasons, while precipitation shows some distinct sub-regional and seasonally dependent changes, characterized by model scatter. In both winter  and summer  precipitation in general is projected to decrease, . However, the various interacting dynamical influences on precipitation of the region  results in uncertainty in both the patterns and magnitude of future precipitation change. Indeed, while the overall pattern of change has remained the same between CMIP3 and CMIP5, the confidence has decreased somewhat and the boundary between the Mediterranean decreases and the general mid-latitude increase to the north has shifted closer to the region . So, although the Mediterranean side still appears likely to become drier, the likely precipitation changes for the interior land masses are less clear and the intensified and northward shifting ITCZ may imply an increase in precipitation in the most southern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Overall, the projections by the end of the century  indicates little overall change, although with a tendency for reduced precipitation, particular in the high end scenarios . However, regardless of the sign of precipitation change in the high mountain regions of the interior, the influence of warming on the snow pack will very likely cause important changes in the timing and amount of the spring melt . Recent downscaling results  suggest that the eastern Mediterranean will experience a decrease in precipitation during the rainy season due to a northward displacement of the storm tracks . A northward shift in the ITCZ results in more precipitation in the southern part, not previously being seriously affected by it. A moderate change in the annual cycle of precipitation has also been simulated by some models. Precipitation and temperature statistics in RCMs for an area consisting of the western part of the Arab Peninsula was assessed by Black  and Onol and Semazzi  confirming GCM-based findings. Increased drought duration has been projected . Inland from the Mediterranean coastal areas, resolution of the terrain becomes more important and, while downscaled results  broadly agree with GCM projections, higher resolution results in some differences associated with mountain barrier jets . In summary, since AR4 climate models appear to have only modestly improved fidelity in simulating aspects of large-scale climate	0

warm pool . The increase in the number of monsoon break days over India , and the decline in the number of monsoon depressions , are consistent with the overall decrease in seasonal mean rainfall. The frequency of heavy precipitation events is increasing , while light rain events are decreasing . CMIP models reasonably simulate the annual cycle of precipitation and temperature over South Asia  but are limited in simulating fine structures of rainfall variability on sub-seasonal and sub-regional scales . CMIP5 models show improved skill in simulating monsoon variability compared to CMIP3 . Summer precipitation changes in South Asia are consistent overall between CMIP3 and CMIP5 , but model scatter is large in winter precipitation change . Changes in the summer monsoon dominate annual rainfall . The CMIP3 multi-model ensemble shows an increase in summer	0
precipitation , although there are wide variations among model projections . Spatially, the rainfall increase is stronger over northern parts of South Asia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, with a weak decrease over Pakistan . In RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios, frequency of extreme precipitation days shows consistent increasing trends in 2060 and beyond . In six CMIP3 models, precipitation anomalies during Indian summer monsoon breaks strengthen in a warmer climate, but changes in the timing and duration of active/break spells are variable among models . Note that the active/break spells of the monsoon are related to the MJO , a phenomenon that models simulate poorly . High-resolution RCM and GCM projections showed an overall increase of precipitation over a large area of peninsular India , but a significant reduction in orographic rainfall in both seasonal mean and extreme events on west coasts of India . Such spatial variations in projected precipitation near orography are noticeable in Figure 14.24 on the background of the overall increase. CMIP5 models project a clear increase in temperature over India especially in winter , with enhanced warming during night than day  and over northern India . In summer, extremely hot days and nights are projected to increase. Table 14.1 summarizes the projected temperature and precipitation changes for SAS in the RCP4.5 scenario based on CMIP5. In summary, there is high confidence in projected rise in temperature. There is medium confidence in summer monsoon precipitation increase in the future over South Asia. Model projections diverge on smaller regional scales.	0
14.8.12 Southeast Asia Southeast Asia features a complex range of terrains and land-sea contrasts. Across the region, temperature has been increasing at a rate of 0.14C to 0.20C per decade since the 1960s , coupled with a rising number of hot days and warm nights, and a decline in cooler weather . A positive trend in the occurrence of heavy  and light  rain events and a negative trend in moderate  rain events has been observed . Annual total wet-day rainfall has increased by 22 mm per decade, while rainfall from extreme rain days has increased by 10 mm per decade . Several large-scale phenomena influence the climate of this region. While ENSO  influence is predominant in East Malaysia and areas east of it, Maritime continent monsoon  influences the climate in Peninsular Malaya. The impact of the IOD  is more prominent in eastern Indonesia. Thus climate variability and trends differ vastly across the region and between seasons. Between 1955 and 2005 the ratio of rainfall in the wet to	0
the dry seasons increased . This appears to be at least in part consistent with an upward trend of the IOD. While an increasing frequency of extreme events has been reported in the northern parts of South East Asia, decreasing trends in such events are reported in Myanmar ; see also Figure 14.25. For a given region, strong seasonality in change is observed. In Peninsular Malaya during the southwest monsoon season, total rainfall and the frequency of wet days decreased, but rainfall intensity increased in much of the region . During the northeast monsoon, total rainfall, the frequency of extreme rainfall events, and rainfall intensity all increased over the peninsula . High-resolution model simulations are necessary to resolve complex terrain such as in Southeast Asia . In a RCM downscaling simulation using the A1B emission scenario , regional average rainfall was projected to increase, consistent with a combination of the `warmer getting wetter' mechanism , an increase in summer monsoon, though there is a lack of consensus on future ENSO changes. The spatial pattern of change is similar to that projected in the AR4 . The median increase in temperature over land ranges from 0.8C in RCP2.6 to 3.2C in RCP8.5 by the end of this century . A moderate increase in precipitation is projected for the region: 1% in RCP2.6 increasing to 8% in RCP8.5 by 2100 . On islands neighbouring the southeast tropical Indian Ocean, rainfall is projected to decrease during July to November , consistent with a slower oceanic warming in the east than in the west tropical Indian Ocean, despite little change projected in the IOD . In summary, warming is very likely to continue with substantial sub-regional variations. There is medium confidence in a moderate increase in rainfall, except on Indonesian islands neighbouring the southeast Indian Ocean. Strong regional variations are expected because of terrain.	0
14.8.13 Australia and New Zealand The climate of Australia is a mix of tropical and extratropical influences. Northern Australia lies in the tropics and is strongly affected by the Australian monsoon circulation  and ENSO . Southern Australia extends into the extratropical westerly circulation and is also affected by the middle latitude storm track , the SAM , mid-latitude transient wave propagation, and remotely by the IOD  and ENSO. Eastern-northeastern Australian rainfall is strongly influenced by the ENSO cycle, with La Nina years typically associated with wet conditions and more frequent and intense tropical cyclones in summer, and El Nino years with drier than normal conditions, most notably in spring. The SAM plays a significant role in modulating southern Australian rainfall, the positive SAM being associated with generally above-normal rainfall during summer , but in winter with reduced rainfall, particularly in Southwest 1273	0

. The well-documented poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zone , particularly in April and May, is shown to account for much of the April-May reduction . Rainfall trends over southeastern Australia in spring, far weaker but with a signature in the subtropical ridge , have been shown to be linked with trends and variability in the IOD . Antarctic proxy data that capture both eastern Australian rainfall and ENSO variability  show a predominance of El Nino/drier conditions in the 20th century than was the average over the last millennium. On seasonal to decadal time scales, New Zealand precipitation is modulated by the SAM , ENSO  and the IPO . Increased westerly flow across New Zealand, associated with negative SAM and with El Nino events, leads to increased rainfall and generally lower than normal temperatures in western regions. The positive SAM and La Nina conditions are generally associated with increased rainfall in the north and east of the country, and warmer than normal conditions. On longer time scales, a drying trend since 1979 across much of New Zealand during austral summer is consistent with recent trends in the SAM and to a lesser extent ENSO and the IPO . In western regions, however, the drying is accompanied by a trend towards increased heavy rainfall . Temperatures over New Zealand have risen by just under 1C over the past century . The upward trend has been modulated by an increase in the frequency of cool southerly wind flows over the country since the 1950s, without which the observed warming is consistent with largescale anthropogenic forcing . A recent analysis  shows that climate projections over Australia using CMIP5 models, which generally simulate the climate of Australia well , are highly consistent with existing CMIP3-derived projections. The projected changes include a further 1.0 to 5.0C temperature rise by the year 2070 ; a long-term drying over southern areas during winter, particularly in the southwest , that is consistent with an upward trend of the SAM ; a long-term rainfall decline over southern and eastern areas during spring, in part consistent with a upward trend of the IOD index . Precipitation change in northeast Australia remains uncertain , related to the lack of consensus over how ENSO may change . In terms of climate extremes, more frequent hot days and nights and less frequent cold days and nights are projected . Changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall events generally follow the mean rainfall change , although there is an increase in most regions in the intensity of short duration extremes . For New Zealand, future climate projections suggest further increases in the westerlies in winter and spring, though model biases in jet latitude in the present climate reduce confidence in the detail of future	0
projections . The influence of poleward expansion of the subtropical high-pressure belt is projected to lead to drier conditions in parts of the country , and a decrease in westerly wind strength in northern regions. Such projections imply increased seasonality of rainfall in many regions of New Zealand . Both flood and drought occurrence is projected to approximately double over New Zealand during the 21st century, under the SRES A1B scenario. Temperatures are projected to rise at about 70% of the global rate, because of the buffering effect of the oceans around New Zealand. Temperature rises are projected to be smallest in spring  while the season of greatest warming varies by region around the country. Continued decreases in frost frequency, and increases in the frequency of high-temperature extremes, are expected, but have not been quantified . In summary, based on understanding of recent trends and on CMIP5 results, it is likely that cool season precipitation will decrease over southern Australia associated in part with trends in the SAM, the IOD and a poleward shift and expansion of the subtropical dry zone. It is very likely that Australia will continue to warm through the 21st century, at a rate similar to the global land surface mean. The frequency of very warm days is very likely to increase through this century, across the whole country. It is very likely that temperatures will continue to rise over New Zealand. Precipitation is likely to increase in western regions in winter and spring, but the magnitude of change is likely to remain comparable to that of natural climate variability through the rest of the century. In summer and autumn, it is as likely as not that precipitation amounts will change.	0
14.8.14 Pacific Islands Region The Pacific Islands region includes the northwest tropical Pacific, and the tropical southwest Pacific. North of the Equator, the wet season occurs from May to November. In the south, the wet seasons occurs from November to April. The phenomena mainly responsible for climate variations in the Pacific Islands are ENSO , the SPCZ , the ITCZ  and the WNPSM . During El Nino events, the ITCZ and SPCZ move closer to the equator, rainfall decreases in western regions and increases in the central Pacific, and tropical cyclone numbers tend to increase and to occur farther east than normal . During La Nina, the western tropical Pacific tends to experience above-average numbers of tropical cyclones . The seasonal evolution of the SPCZ has a strong influence on the seasonality of the climate of the southern tropical Pacific, particularly during the wet season. The SPCZ moves northward during moderate El Nino events and southward during La Nina events . During El Nino events, southwest Pacific Island nations experience an increased occurrence of forest fires and droughts , and an increased probability of tropical cyclone damage, as tropical cyclogenesis tends to reside within 6 to 10 south of the SPCZ . 1275	0
Nauru experiences drought during La Nina as the SPCZ and ITCZ move to the west . During strong El Nino events  the SPCZ undergoes an extreme swing of up to 10 degrees towards the equator and collapses to a more zonally oriented structure . The impacts from these zonal SPCZ events are much more severe than those from moderate El Nino events , and can induce massive droughts and food shortages . Temperatures have increased at a rate between 0.1C and 0.2C per decade throughout the Pacific Islands during the 20th century . Changes in temperature extremes have followed those of mean temperatures . During 1961-2000, locations to the northeast of the SPCZ became wetter, with the largest trends occurring in the eastern Pacific Ocean , while locations to the southwest of the SPCZ became drier , indicative of a northeastward shift of the SPCZ. Trends in the frequency of rain days were generally similar to those of total annual rainfall . Since 1980, western Pacific monsoon- and ITCZ-related rain during June to August has decreased . Future projections for tropical Pacific Island nations are based on direct outputs from a suite of CMIP3 models, updated using CMIP5 wherever available . These projections carry a large uncertainty, even in the sign of change, as discussed below and as evident in Table 14.1. Annual average air and sea surface temperature are projected to continue to increase for all tropical Pacific countries. By 2055, under the high A2 emissions scenario, the increase is projected to be 1C to 2C. A rise in the number of hot days and warm nights is also projected, and a decline in cooler weather, as already observed . For a low-emission scenario, the lower range decreases about 0.5C while the upper range reduces by between 0.2C and 0.5C. To a large extent, the response of the ITCZ, the SPCZ, and the WNPSM to greenhouse warming will determine how rainfall patterns will change in tropical Pacific. In northwestern and near-equatorial regions, rainfall during all seasons is projected to increase in the 21st century. Wet season increases are consistent with the expected intensification of the WNPSM and the ITCZ . For the southwestern tropical Pacific, the CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensemble mean change in summer rainfall is far smaller than the inter-model range . There is a projected intensification in the western part of the SPCZ and near the equator with little mean change in SPCZ position . For the southern group of the Cook Islands, the Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu, average rainfall during the wet season is projected to increase; and for Vanuatu, Tonga, Samoa, Niue, Fiji, a decrease in dry season rainfall is accompanied by an increase in the wet season, indicating an intensified seasonal cycle.	0
et al., 2012a), it has recently been questioned . There are two competing mechanisms, the `wet regions getting wetter' and the `warmest getting wetter, or coldest getting drier' paradigms. These two mechanisms compete within much of the SPCZ region. Based on a multi-model ensemble of 55 greenhouse warming experiments, in which model biases were corrected, tropical SST changes between 2C to 3C resulted in a 5% decrease of austral summer moisture convergence in the current SPCZ region . This projects a diminished rainy season for most Southwest Pacific island nations. In Samoa and neighbouring islands, summer rainfall may decrease on average by 10 to 20% during the 21st century as simulated by the hierarchy of bias-corrected atmospheric model experiments. Less rainfall, combined with increasing surface temperatures and enhanced potential evaporation, could increase the chance for longerterm droughts in the region. Such projections are completely opposite to those based on direct model outputs . Recent downscaling experiments support the above conclusion regarding the impact of biases on the SPCZ change, and suggest that the projected intensification of the ITCZ may have uncertainties of a similar nature . In these experiments a bias correction is applied to average sea surface temperatures, and the atmosphere is forced with the `correct' climatological seasonal cycle together with warming derived from large-scale model outputs. The results show opposite changes in much of the SPCZ and some of the ITCZ regions, resulting in much lower confidence in rainfall projections. Despite the uncertainty, there is general agreement in model projections regarding an increase in rainfall along the equator , and regarding a faster warming rate in the equatorial Pacific than the off-equatorial regions . A potential consequence is an increase in the frequency of the zonal SPCZ events . In summary, based on CMIP3 and CMIP5 model projections and recently observed trends, it is very likely that temperatures, including the frequency and magnitude of extreme high temperatures, will continue to increase through the 21st century. In equatorial regions, the consistency across model projections suggests that rainfall is likely to increase. However, given new model results and physical insights since the AR4, the rainfall outlook is uncertain in regions directly affected by the SPCZ and western portion of the ITCZ.	0
and generally non-significant impact over West Antarctica . ENSO is associated with circulation anomalies over the southeast Pacific that primarily affect West Antarctica . ENSO variability tends to produce out-of-phase variations between the western and eastern sectors of West Antarctica , in association with the PSA pattern . The positive summer/autumn trend in the SAM index in recent decades  has been related to the contrasting temperature trend patterns observed in these two seasons, with warming in the east and north of the Antarctic Peninsula and cooling  over much of East Antarctica . The high polarity of the SAM is also consistent with the significant increase in snow accumulation observed in the southern part of the Peninsula .	0
Antarctica , but the spatial pattern of precipitation change remains uncertain. In summary, consistency across CMIP5 projections suggests it is very likely that Antarctic temperatures will increase through the rest of the century, but more slowly than the global mean rate of increase . SSTs of the oceans around Antarctica are likely to rise more slowly than surface air temperature over the Antarctic land mass. As temperatures rise, it is also likely that precipitation will increase , up to 20% or more over the East Antarctic. However, given known difficulties associated with correctly modelling Antarctic climate, and uncertainties associated with future SAM and ENSO trends and the extent of Antarctic sea ice, precipitation projections have only medium confidence.	0
Unlike the eastern Antarctic Peninsula, its western coast shows maximum warming in austral winter , which has been attributed to reduced sea ice concentrations in the Bellingshausen Sea. Recent studies have emphasized the role of tropical SST forcing not directly linked to ENSO to explain the prominent spring- and wintertime atmospheric warming in West Antarctica . There is further evidence of tropical SST influence on Antarctic temperatures and precipitation on decadal to inter-decadal time scales . Modelling of Antarctic climate remains challenging, in part because of the nature of the high-elevation ice sheet in the east Antarctic and its effects on regional climate . Moreover, modelling ice properties themselves, for both land ice and sea ice, is an area that is still developing despite improvements in recent years . Modelling the role of the stratosphere and of ozone recovery is critical for Antarctic climate, as stratospheric change is intimately linked to trends in the SAM . The projected easing of the positive SAM trend in austral summer  may act to delay future loss of Antarctic sea ice . It is unclear what effect ENSO will have on future Antarctic climate change as the ENSO response to climate change remains uncertain . Seasonally, changes in the strength of the circumpolar westerlies are also expected during the 21st century as a result of changes in the semi-annual oscillation caused by alterations in the mid- to high-latitude temperature gradient in the SH. Bracegirdle et al.  considered modelled circulation changes over the Southern Ocean and found a more pronounced strengthening of the autumn peak of the semi-annual oscillation compared with the spring peak. Future changes in surface temperature over Antarctica are likely to be smaller than the global mean, and much smaller than those projected for the Arctic, because of the buffering effect of the southern oceans, and the thermal mass of the east Antarctic ice sheet . Warming is likely to bring increased precipitation on average across	0
Table 14.1 | Temperature and precipitation projections by the CMIP5 global models. The figures shown are averages over SREX regions  of the projections by a set of 42 global models for the RCP4.5 scenario. Added to the SREX regions are a six other regions including the two Polar Regions, the Caribbean, Indian Ocean and Pacific Island States . The 26 SREX regions are: Alaska/NW Canada , Eastern Canada/Greenland/Iceland , Western North America , Central North America , Eastern North America , Central America/Mexico , Amazon , NE Brazil , West Coast South America , Southeastern South America , Northern Europe , Central Europe , Southern Europe/the Mediterranean , Sahara , Western Africa , Eastern Africa , Southern Africa , Northern Asia , Western Asia , Central Asia , Tibetan Plateau , Eastern Asia , Southern Asia , Southeastern Asia , Northern Australia  and Southern Australia/New Zealand . The area-mean temperature and precipitation responses are first averaged for each model over the 1986-2005 period from the historical simulations and the 2016-2035, 2046-2065 and 2081-2100 periods of the RCP4.5 experiments. Based on the difference between these two periods, the table shows the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles, and the lowest and highest response among the 42 models, for temperature in degrees Celsius and precipitation as a percent change. Regions in which the middle half  of this distribution is all of the same sign in the precipitation response are coloured light brown for decreasing precipitation and light green for increasing precipitation. Information is provided for land areas contained in the boxes unless otherwise indicated. The temperature responses are averaged over the boreal winter and summer seasons; December, January and February  and June, July and August  respectively. The precipitation responses are averaged over half year periods, boreal winter; October, November, December, January, February and March  and summer; April, May, June, July, August and September .	0

Introduction and Scope This Annex presents a series of figures showing global and regional patterns of climate change computed from global climate model output gathered as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 . Maps of surface air temperature change and relative precipitation change  in different seasons are presented for the globe and for a number of different sub-continental-scale regions. Twenty-year average changes for the near term , for the mid term  and for the long term  are given, relative to a reference period of 1986-2005. Time series for temperature and relative precipitation changes are shown for global land and sea averages, the 26 sub-continental SREX  regions  augmented with polar regions and the Caribbean, two Indian Ocean and three Pacific Ocean regions. In total this Annex gives projections for 35 regions, 2 variables and 2 seasons. The projections are made under the Representative Concentration Pathway  scenarios, which are introduced in Chapter 1 with more technical detail given in Section 12.3 . Maps are shown only for the RCP4.5 scenario; however, the time series presented show how the area-average response varies among the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Spatial maps for the other RCP scenarios and additional seasons are presented in the Annex I Supplementary Material. Figures AI.1 and AI.2 give a graphical explanation of aspects of both the time series plots and the spatial maps. While some of the background to the information presented is given here, discussion of the maps and time series, as well as important additional background, is provided in Chapters 9, 11, 12 and 14. Figure captions on each page of the Atlas reference the specific sub-sections in the report relevant to the regions considered on that page. The projection of future climate change involves the careful evaluation of models, taking into account uncertainties in observations and consideration of the physical basis of the findings, in order to characterize the credibility of the projections and assess their sensitivity to uncertainties. As discussed in Chapter 9, different climate models have varying degrees of success in simulating past climate variability and mean state when compared to observations. Verification of regional trends is discussed in Box 11.2 and provides further information on the credibility of model projections. The information presented in this Annex is based entirely on all available CMIP5 model output with equal weight given to each model or version with different parameterizations. Complementary methods for making quantitative projections, in which model output is combined with information about model performance using statistical techniques, exist and should be considered in impacts studies . Although results from the application of such methods can be assessed alongside the projections from CMIP5 presented here, it is beyond the scope of this Annex. Nor do the simple maps provided represent a robust estimate of the uncertainty associated with the projections. Here the range of model spread is provided as a simple, albeit imperfect, guide to the range of possible futures . Alternative approaches used to estimate projection uncertainty	0
are discussed in Sections 11.3.1 and 12.2.2 to 12.2.3. The reliability of past trends is assessed in Box 11.2, which concludes that the time series and maps cannot be interpreted literally as probability density functions. They should not be interpreted as `forecasts'. Projections of future climate change are conditional on assumptions of climate forcing, affected by shortcomings of climate models and inevitably also subject to internal variability when considering specific periods. Projected patterns of climate change may differ from one climate model generation to the next due to improvements in models. Some model-inadequacies are common to all models, but so are many patterns of change across successive generations of models, which gives some confidence in projections. The information presented is intended to be only a starting point for anyone interested in more detailed information on projections of future climate change and complements the assessment in Chapters 11, 12 and 14.	0
Technical Notes Data and Processing: The figures have been constructed using the CMIP5 model output available at the time of the AR5 cut-off for accepted papers . This data set comprises 32/42/25/39 scenario experiments for RCP2.6/4.5/6.0/8.5 from 42 climate models . Only concentration-driven experiments are used  and only one ensemble member from each model is selected, even if multiple realizations exist with different initial conditions and different realizations of natural variability. Hence each model is given equal weight. Maps from only one scenario  are shown but time series are included from all four RCPs. Maps from other RCPs are presented in the Annex I Supplementary Material. Reference Period: Projections are expressed as anomalies with respect to the reference period of 1986-2005 for both time series and spatial maps . Thus the changes are relative to the climate change that has already occurred since the pre-industrial period and which is discussed in Chapters 2 and 10. For quantities where the trend is larger than the natural variability such as large-area temperature changes, a more recent reference period would give better estimates ; for quantities where the natural variability is much larger than the trend a longer reference period would be preferable. Equal Model Weighting: Model evaluation uses a multitude of techniques  and there is no consensus in the community about how to use this information to assign likelihood to different model projections. Consequently, the different CMIP5 models used for the projections in the Atlas are all considered to give equally likely projections in the sense of `one model, one vote'. Models with variations in physical parameterization schemes are treated as distinct models. Variables: Two variables have been plotted: surface air temperature change and relative precipitation change. The relative precipitation change is defined as the percentage change from the 1986-2005 reference period in each ensemble member. For the time series, the variables are first averaged over the domain and then the changes from the reference period are computed. This implies that in regions with 1313	0
Seasons: For temperature, the standard meteorological seasons June to August and December to February are shown, as these often correspond roughly with the warmest and coldest seasons. The annual mean and remaining seasons, March to May and September to October can be found in the Annex I Supplementary Material. For precipitation, the half-years April to September and October to March are shown so that in most monsoon areas the local rain seasons are entirely contained within the seasonal range plotted. Because the seasonal average is computed first, followed by the percentile change, these numbers are dominated by the rainy months within the half-year. The annual means are included in the Supplementary Material. Regions: In addition to the global maps, the areas defined in the SREX  are plotted with the addition of six regions containing the Caribbean, Indian Ocean and Pacific Island States and land and sea areas of the two polar regions. For regions containing large land-areas, averages are computed only over land grid points only. For ocean regions, averages are computed over both land and ocean grid points . A grid box is considered land if the land fraction is larger than 50% and sea if it is smaller than this. SREX regions with long coastlines  therefore include some influence of the ocean. Note that temperature and precipitation over islands may be very different from those over the surrounding sea. Time Series: For each of the resulting areas the areal mean is computed on the original model grid using land, sea or all points, depending on the definition of the region . As an indication of the model uncertainty and natural variability, the time series of each model and scenario over the common period 1900-2100 are shown on the top of the page as anomalies relative to 1986-2005 . The multi-model ensemble means are also shown. Finally, for the period 2081-2100, the 20-year means are computed and the box-and-whisker plots show the 5th, 25th, 50th , 75th and 95th percentiles sampled over the distribution of the 20-year means of the model time series indicated in Table AI.1, including both natural variability and model spread. In the 20-year means the natural variability is suppressed relative to the annual values in the time series whereas the model uncertainty is the same. Note that owing to a smaller number of models, the box-and-whisker plots for the RCP2.6 scenario and especially the RCP6.0 scenario are less certain than those for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Spatial Maps: The maps in the Atlas show, for an area encompassing two or three regions, the difference between the periods 2016-2035, 2046-2065 and 2081-2100 and the reference period 1986-2005. As local projections of climate change are uncertain, a measure of the range of model projections is shown in addition to the median response of the model ensemble interpolated to a common 2.5 grid . It should again be emphasized  that this range does not represent the full uncertainty in the projection. On the left, the 25th percentile of the distribution 1314	0
of ensemble members is shown, on the right the 75th percentile. The median is shown in the middle . The distribution combines the effects of natural variability and model spread. The colour scale is kept constant over all maps. Hatching: Hatching indicates regions where the magnitude of the change of the 20-year mean is less than 1 standard deviation of model-estimated present-day natural variability of 20-year mean differences. The natural variability is estimated using all pre-industrial control runs which are at least 500 years long. The first 100 years of the pre-industrial are ignored. The natural variability is then calculated for every grid point as the standard deviation of non-overlapping 20-year means after a quadratic fit is subtracted at every grid point to eliminate model drift. This is multiplied by the square root of 2, a factor that arises as the comparison is between two distributions of numbers. The median across all models of that quantity is used. This characterizes the typical difference between two 20-year averages that would be expected due to unforced internal variability. The hatching is applied to all maps so, for example, if the 25th percentile of the distribution of model projections is less than 1 standard deviation of natural variability, it is hatched. The hatching can be interpreted as some indication of the strength of the future anomalies from present-day climate, when compared to the strength of present day internal 20-year variability. It either means that the change is relatively small or that there is little agreement between models on the sign of the change. It is presented only as a guide to assessing the strength of change as the difference between two 20-year intervals. Using other measures of natural variability would give smaller or larger hatched areas, but the colours underneath the hatching would not be very different. Other methods of hatching and stippling are possible  and, in cases where such information is critical, it is recommended that thorough attention is paid to assessing significance using a statistical test appropriate to the problem being considered. Scenarios: Spatial patterns of changes for scenarios other than RCP4.5 can be found in the Annex I Supplementary Material.	0

Introduction Annex II presents, in tabulated form, data related to historical and projected changes in the climate system that are assessed in the chapters of this report . It also includes some comparisons with the Third Assessment Report  and Fourth Assessment Report  results. These data include values for emissions into the atmosphere, atmospheric abundances and burdens , effective radiative forcing , and global mean surface temperatures and sea level. Projections from 2010 to 2100 focus on the RCP scenarios . Projections also include previous IPCC scenarios , Special Report on Emission Scenarios  A2 and B1, TAR Appendix II) and some alternative near-term scenarios for methane  and short-lived pollutants that impact climate or air quality. Emissions from biomass burning are included as anthropogenic. ERF from land use change is also included in some tables. Where uncertainties or ranges are presented here, they are noted in each table as being a recommended value or model ensemble mean/ median with a 68% confidence interval  or 90% confidence interval  or statistics  of an ensemble of models. In some cases these are a formal evaluation of uncertainty as assessed in the chapters, but in other cases  they just describe the statistical results from the available models, and the referenced chapters must be consulted for the assessed uncertainty or confidence level of these results. In the case of Table AII.7.5, for example, the global mean surface temperature change  relative to 1986-2005 is a statistical summary of the spread in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project  ensembles for each of the scenarios: model biases and model dependencies are not accounted for; the percentiles do not correspond to the assessed uncertainty derived in Chapters 11  and 12 ; and statistical spread across models cannot be interpreted in terms of calibrated language . The Representative Concentration Pathway  scenarios for emissions include only anthropogenic sources and use a single model to project from emissions to abundances to radiative forcing to climate change . We include projected changes in natural carbon dioxide  sources and sinks for 2010- 2100 based on this assessment . Present-day natural and anthropogenic emissions of CH4 and nitrous oxide  are assessed and used to scale the RCP anthropogenic emissions to be consistent with these best estimates . Current model evaluations of atmospheric chemistry and the carbon cycle, including results from the CMIP5 and Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project  projects, are used to project future composition and ERF separately from the RCP model (see Sections	0
6.4.3, 11.3.5 and 12.3). Thus, projected changes in greenhouse gases , aerosols and ERF evaluated in this report may differ from the published RCPs and from what was used in the CMIP5 runs, and these are denoted RCP&. The CMIP5 climate projections used for the most part the RCP concentration pathways for well-mixed greenhouse gases  and the emissions pathways for ozone  and aerosol precursors. Such differences are discussed in the relevant chapters and noted in the tables. For each species, the abundances ; ppb = nanomoles per mole ; and ppt = picomoles per mole ), burdens , average column amount  = 2.687 x 1016 molecules per cm2), AOD , ERF , and other climate system quantities are calculated for scenarios using methodologies based on the latest climate chemistry and climate carbon models . Results are shown for individual years  and decadal averages , although some 10-year periods are different, see table notes. Year 2011 is the last year for observed quantities . Results are shown as global mean values except for environmental data focussing on air quality , which give regional mean surface abundances of O3 and fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 m . Results for global mean surface temperature  show only raw CMIP5 data or data from previous assessments. For best estimates of near-term and long-term temperature change see Chapters 11 and 12, respectively. Results for global mean sea level rise  are assessed values with uncertainties described in Chapter 13.	0

Notes: For all anthropogenic emissions see Box 1.1 , Section 8.2.2, Figure 8.2, Sections 11.3.5.1.1 to 3, 11.3.5.2, 11.3.6.1. Ten-year average values  are given for RCP-based emissions, but single-year emissions are shown for other scenarios. RCPn.n = harmonized anthropogenic emissions as reported. SRES A2 and B1 and IS92a are from TAR Appendix II. AR5 RCPn.n& emissions have  1-s  uncertainties and are based on the methodology of Prather et al.  updated with CMIP5 results . Projections of CH4 lifetimes are harmonized based on PI  and PD  budgets that include uncertainties in lifetimes and abundances. All projected RCP abundances for CH4 and N2O  rescale each of the RCP emissions by a fixed factor equal to the ratio of RCP to AR5 anthropogenic emissions at year 2010 to ensure harmonization between total emissions, lifetimes and observed abundances. Natural emissions are kept constant but included as additional uncertainty. Independent emission estimates are shown as follows: MFR/CLE are the maximum feasible reduction and current legislation scenarios from Dentener et al. , while MFR*/CLE* are the similarly labeled scenarios from Cofala et al. . REFL/REFU are lower/upper bounds from the reference scenario of van Vuuren et al. , while POLL/POLU are the lower/upper bounds from their policy scenario. AMEL/AMEU are lower/upper bounds from Calvin et al. . RogL/RogU are lower/upper bounds from Rogelj et et. .	0
Notes: RCPn.n& lifetimes based on best estimate with uncertainty for 2000-2010  and then projecting changes in key factors . All uncertainties are 68% confidence intervals. RCPn.n^ lifetimes are from ACCMIP results  scaled to 11.2  1.3 yr for year 2000; the ACCMIP mean and standard deviation in 2000 are 9.8  1.5 yr. Projected ACCMIP values combine the present day uncertainty with the model standard deviation of future change. Note that the total atmospheric lifetime of CH4 must include other losses , and for 2010 it is 9.1  0.9 yr, see Chapter 8, Section 11.3.5.1.1.	0
 Notes: HTAP results are from Wild et al.  and use the published O3 sensitivities to regional emissions from the HTAP multi-model study  and scale those O3 changes to the RCP emission scenarios. The 1 standard deviation  over the range of 14 parametric models is shown for year 2000 and is similar for all years. Results from the SRES A2 and B1 scenarios are from the TAR OxComp studies diagnosed by Wild . CLE and MFR results  include uncertainty  in the change since year 2000, and CLE alone includes climate effects. The CMIP5 and ACCMIP results are from V. Naik and A. Fiore based on Fiore et al.  and include the standard deviation over the models in year 2000, which is similar for following years. This does not necessarily reflect the uncertainty in the projected change, which may be smaller, see Fiore et al. . The difference in year 2000 between CMIP5  and ACCMIP  reflect different model biases. Even though ACCMIP only has three decades , the greater number of models  makes this a more robust estimate. See Chapter 11, ES, Section 11.3.5.2.2.	0
Notes: This spread in the model ensembles  is not a measure of uncertainty. For the AR5 assessment of global mean surface temperature changes and uncertainties see: Section 11.3.6.3 and Figure 11.25 for the near-term  temperatures; and Section 12.4.1 and Tables 12.2-3 for the long term . See discussion about uncertainty and ensembles in Section 12.2, which explains how model spread is not equivalent to uncertainty. Results here are shown for the CMIP5 archive  for the RCPs and the similarly current CMIP3 archive for SRES A1B, which is not the same set of models used in AR4 . Ten-year averages are shown . Temperature changes are relative to the reference period , using CMIP5 for all four RCPs  and CMIP3 for SRES A1B . The warming from early instrumental record  to the modern reference period  is derived from HadCRUT4 observations as 0.61C .	0
Abrupt climate change A large-scale change in the climate system that takes place over a few decades or less, persists  for at least a few decades and causes substantial disruptions in human and natural systems. Active layer The layer of ground that is subject to annual thawing and freezing in areas underlain by permafrost. Adjustment time See Lifetime. See also Response time. Advection Transport of water or air along with its properties  by winds or currents. Regarding the general distinction between advection and convection, the former describes transport by large-scale motions of the atmosphere or ocean, while convection describes the predominantly vertical, locally induced motions.	0
Aerosol A suspension of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical size between a few nanometres and 10 m that reside in the atmosphere for at least several hours. For convenience the term aerosol, which includes both the particles and the suspending gas, is often used in this report in its plural form to mean aerosol particles. Aerosols may be of either natural or anthropogenic origin. Aerosols may influence climate in several ways: directly through scattering and absorbing radiation  and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei, modifying the optical properties and lifetime of clouds . Aerosol-cloud interaction A process by which a perturbation to aerosol affects the microphysical properties and evolution of clouds through the aerosol role as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei, particularly in ways that affect radiation or precipitation; such processes can also include the effect of clouds and precipitation on aerosol. The aerosol perturbation can be anthropogenic or come from some natural source. The radiative forcing from such interactions has traditionally been attributed to numerous indirect aerosol effects, but in this report, only two levels of radiative forcing  are distinguished: Radiative forcing  due to aerosol-cloud interactions  The radiative forcing  due to the change in number or size distribution of cloud droplets or ice crystals that is the proximate result of an aerosol perturbation, with other variables  remaining equal. In liquid clouds, an increase in cloud droplet concentration and surface area would increase the cloud albedo. This effect is also known as the cloud albedo effect, first indirect effect, or Twomey effect. It is a largely theoretical concept that cannot readily be isolated in observations or comprehensive process models due to the rapidity and ubiquity of rapid adjustments. Effective radiative forcing  due to aerosol-cloud interactions  The final radiative forcing  from the aerosol perturbation including the rapid adjustments to the initial change in droplet or crystal formation rate. These adjustments include changes in the strength of convection, precipitation efficiency, cloud fraction, lifetime or water content of clouds, and the formation or suppression of clouds in remote areas due to altered circulations. The total effective radiative forcing due to both aerosol-cloud and aerosol-radiation interactions is denoted aerosol effective radiative forcing . See also Aerosol-radiation interaction. 1448	0
Aerosol-radiation interaction An interaction of aerosol directly with radiation produce radiative effects. In this report two levels of radiative forcing  are distinguished: Radiative forcing  due to aerosol-radiation interactions  The radiative forcing  of an aerosol perturbation due directly to aerosol-radiation interactions, with all environmental variables remaining unaffected. Traditionally known in the literature as the direct aerosol forcing . Effective radiative forcing  due to aerosol-radiation interactions  The final radiative forcing  from the aerosol perturbation including the rapid adjustments to the initial change in radiation. These adjustments include changes in cloud caused by the impact of the radiative heating on convective or largerscale atmospheric circulations, traditionally known as semi-direct aerosol forcing . The total effective radiative forcing due to both aerosol-cloud and aerosol-radiation interactions is denoted aerosol effective radiative forcing . See also Aerosol-cloud interaction. Afforestation Planting of new forests on lands that historically have not contained forests. For a discussion of the term forest and related terms such as afforestation, reforestation and deforestation, see the IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry . See also the report on Definitions and Methodological Options to Inventory Emissions from Direct Human-induced Degradation of Forests and Devegetation of Other Vegetation Types . Airborne fraction The fraction of total CO2 emissions  remaining in the atmosphere. Air mass A widespread body of air, the approximately homogeneous properties of which  have been established while that air was situated over a particular region of the Earth's surface, and  undergo specific modifications while in transit away from the source region . Albedo The fraction of solar radiation reflected by a surface or object, often expressed as a percentage. Snow-covered surfaces have a high albedo, the albedo of soils ranges from high to low, and vegetation-covered surfaces and oceans have a low albedo. The Earth's planetary albedo varies mainly through varying cloudiness, snow, ice, leaf area and and cover changes. Alkalinity A measure of the capacity of an aqueous solution to neutralize acids. Altimetry A technique for measuring the height of the Earth's surface with respect to the geocentre of the Earth within a defined terrestrial reference frame . Annular modes See Northern Annular Mode  and Southern Annular Mode . Anthropogenic Resulting from or produced by human activities. Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation/Variability  A multi-decadal  fluctuation in the North Atlantic, in which sea surface temperatures showed warm phases during roughly 1860 to 1880 and 1930 to 1960 and cool phases during 1905 to 1925 and 1970 to 1990 with a range of approximately 0.4C. See AMO Index, Box 2.5. Atmosphere The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth. The dry atmosphere consists almost entirely of nitrogen  and oxygen , together with a number of trace gases, such as argon , helium and radiatively active greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (0.035%	0
volume mixing ratio) and ozone. In addition, the atmosphere contains the greenhouse gas water vapour, whose amounts are highly variable but typically around 1% volume mixing ratio. The atmosphere also contains clouds and aerosols. Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model  See Climate model. Atmospheric boundary layer The atmospheric layer adjacent to the Earth's surface that is affected by friction against that boundary surface, and possibly by transport of heat and other variables across that surface . The lowest 100 m of the boundary layer , where mechanical generation of turbulence is dominant, is called the surface boundary layer or surface layer. Atmospheric lifetime See Lifetime. Attribution See Detection and attribution. Autotrophic respiration Respiration by photosynthetic  organisms . Basal lubrication Reduction of friction at the base of an ice sheet or glacier due to lubrication by meltwater. This can allow the glacier or ice sheet to slide over its base. Meltwater may be produced by pressureinduced melting, friction or geothermal heat, or surface melt may drain to the base through holes in the ice. Baseline/reference The baseline  is the state against which change is measured. A baseline period is the period relative to which anomalies are computed. The baseline concentration of a trace gas is that measured at a location not influenced by local anthropogenic emissions. Bayesian method/approach A Bayesian method is a method by which a statistical analysis of an unknown or uncertain quantity is carried out in two steps. First, a prior probability distribution for the uncertain quantity is formulated on the basis of existing knowledge . At this first stage, an element of subjectivity may influence the choice, but in many cases, the prior probability distribution can be chosen as neutrally as possible, in order not to influence the final outcome of the analysis. In the second step, newly acquired data are used to update the prior distribution into a posterior distribution. The update is carried out either through an analytic computation or though numeric approximation, using a theorem formulated by and named after the British mathematician Thomas Bayes . Biological pump The process of transporting carbon from the ocean's surface layers to the deep ocean by the primary production of marine phytoplankton, which converts dissolved inorganic carbon  and nutrients into organic matter through photosynthesis. This natural cycle is limited primarily by the availability of light and nutrients such as phosphate, nitrate and silicic acid, and micronutrients, such as iron. See also Solubility pump. Biomass The total mass of living organisms in a given area or volume; dead plant material can be included as dead biomass. Biomass burning is the burning of living and dead vegetation. Biome A biome is a major and distinct regional element of the biosphere, typically consisting of several ecosystems . Biomes are characterized by typical communities of plants and animals. Biosphere  The part of the Earth system comprising all ecosystems and living organisms, in the atmosphere, on land  or in the oceans , including derived dead organic matter, such as litter, soil organic matter and oceanic detritus.	0
Black carbon  Operationally defined aerosol species based on measurement of light absorption and chemical reactivity and/or thermal stability. It is sometimes referred to as soot. Blocking Associated with persistent, slow-moving high-pressure systems that obstruct the prevailing westerly winds in the middle and high latitudes and the normal eastward progress of extratropical transient storm systems. It is an important component of the intraseasonal climate variability in the extratropics and can cause long-lived weather conditions such as cold spells in winter and summer heat waves. Brewer-Dobson circulation The meridional overturning circulation of the stratosphere transporting air upward in the tropics, poleward to the winter hemisphere, and downward at polar and subpolar latitudes. The Brewer-Dobson circulation is driven by the interaction between upward propagating planetary waves and the mean flow. Burden The total mass of a gaseous substance of concern in the atmosphere. C Stable isotope of carbon having an atomic weight of approximately 13. Measurements of the ratio of 13C/12C in carbon dioxide molecules are used to infer the importance of different carbon cycle and climate processes and the size of the terrestrial carbon reservoir. 13	0
Calving The breaking off of discrete pieces of ice from a glacier, ice sheet or an ice shelf into lake or seawater, producing icebergs. This is a form of mass loss from an ice body. See also Mass balance/budget . Carbonaceous aerosol Aerosol consisting predominantly of organic substances and black carbon. Carbon cycle The term used to describe the flow of carbon  through the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial and marine biosphere and lithosphere. In this report, the reference unit for the global carbon cycle is GtC or equivalently PgC . Carbon dioxide  A naturally occurring gas, also a by-product of burning fossil fuels from fossil carbon deposits, such as oil, gas and coal, of burning biomass, of land use changes and of industrial processes . It is the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas that affects the Earth's radiative balance. It is the reference gas against which other greenhouse gases are measured and therefore has a Global Warming Potential of 1. Carbon dioxide  fertilization The enhancement of the growth of plants as a result of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide  concentration. Carbon Dioxide Removal  Carbon Dioxide Removal methods refer to a set of techniques that aim to remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere by either  increasing natural sinks for carbon or  using chemical engineering to remove the CO2, with the intent of reducing the atmospheric CO2 concentration. CDR methods involve the ocean, land and technical systems, including such methods as iron fertilization, large-scale afforestation and direct capture of CO2 from the atmosphere using engineered chemical means. Some CDR methods fall under the category of geoengineering, though this may not be the case for others, with the distinction being based on the magnitude, scale, and impact of the particular CDR activities. The boundary between CDR and mitigation is not clear and	0
there could be some overlap between the two given current definitions . See also Solar Radiation Management . CFC See Halocarbons. Chaotic A dynamical system such as the climate system, governed by nonlinear deterministic equations , may exhibit erratic or chaotic behaviour in the sense that very small changes in the initial state of the system in time lead to large and apparently unpredictable changes in its temporal evolution. Such chaotic behaviour limits the predictability of the state of a nonlinear dynamical system at specific future times, although changes in its statistics may still be predictable given changes in the system parameters or boundary conditions. Charcoal Material resulting from charring of biomass, usually retaining some of the microscopic texture typical of plant tissues; chemically it consists mainly of carbon with a disturbed graphitic structure, with lesser amounts of oxygen and hydrogen. Chronology Arrangement of events according to dates or times of occurrence. Clathrate  A partly frozen slushy mix of methane gas and ice, usually found in sediments.	0
Clausius-Clapeyron equation/relationship The thermodynamic relationship between small changes in temperature and vapour pressure in an equilibrium system with condensed phases present. For trace gases such as water vapour, this relation gives the increase in equilibrium  water vapour pressure per unit change in air temperature. Climate Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the average weather, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period for averaging these variables is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization. The relevant quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. Climate-carbon cycle feedback A climate feedback involving changes in the properties of land and ocean carbon cycle in response to climate change. In the ocean, changes in oceanic temperature and circulation could affect the atmosphere-ocean CO2 flux; on the continents, climate change could affect plant photosynthesis and soil microbial respiration and hence the flux of CO2 between the atmosphere and the land biosphere. Climate change Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified  by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that the Framework Convention on Climate Change , in its Article 1, defines climate change as: `a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods'. The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition, and climate variability attributable to natural causes. See also Climate change commitment, Detection and Attribution. Climate change commitment Due to the thermal inertia of the ocean and slow processes in the cryosphere and land surfaces, the climate would continue to change even if the atmospheric composition were held fixed at today's values. Past change in atmospheric composition leads to a committed climate change, which continues for as long as a radiative 1450	0
imbalance persists and until all components of the climate system have adjusted to a new state. The further change in temperature after the composition of the atmosphere is held constant is referred to as the constant composition temperature commitment or simply committed warming or warming commitment. Climate change commitment includes other future changes, for example, in the hydrological cycle, in extreme weather events, in extreme climate events, and in sea level change. The constant emission commitment is the committed climate change that would result from keeping anthropogenic emissions constant and the zero emission commitment is the climate change commitment when emissions are set to zero. See also Climate change. Climate feedback An interaction in which a perturbation in one climate quantity causes a change in a second, and the change in the second quantity ultimately leads to an additional change in the first. A negative feedback is one in which the initial perturbation is weakened by the changes it causes; a positive feedback is one in which the initial perturbation is enhanced. In this Assessment Report, a somewhat narrower definition is often used in which the climate quantity that is perturbed is the global mean surface temperature, which in turn causes changes in the global radiation budget. In either case, the initial perturbation can either be externally forced or arise as part of internal variability. See also Climate Feedback Parameter. Climate Feedback Parameter A way to quantify the radiative response of the climate system to a global mean surface temperature change induced by a radiative forcing. It varies as the inverse of the effective climate sensitivity. Formally, the Climate Feedback Parameter  is defined as: a = /T, where Q is the global mean radiative forcing, T is the global mean air surface temperature, F is the heat flux into the ocean and  represents a change with respect to an unperturbed climate. Climate forecast See Climate prediction. Climate index A time series constructed from climate variables that provides an aggregate summary of the state of the climate system. For example, the difference between sea level pressure in Iceland and the Azores provides a simple yet useful historical NAO index. Because of their optimal properties, climate indices are often defined using principal components--linear combinations of climate variables at different locations that have maximum variance subject to certain normalisation constraints . See Box 2.5 for a summary of definitions for established observational indices. See also Climate pattern. Climate model  A numerical representation of the climate system based on the physical, chemical and biological properties of its components, their interactions and feedback processes, and accounting for some of its known properties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity, that is, for any one component or combination of components a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical, chemical or biological processes are explicitly represented or the level at which empirical parametrizations are involved. Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models  provide a representation of the climate system that is near or at the most comprehensive end of the spectrum currently available. There is an evolution towards more complex models with interactive chemistry and biology. Climate models are applied as a research tool to study and simulate the climate, and for operational purposes, including monthly, seasonal and interannual climate predictions. See also Earth System Model, Earth-System Model of Intermediate Complexity, Energy Balance Model, Process-based Model, Regional Climate Model and Semi-empirical model.	0
Climate pattern A set of spatially varying coefficients obtained by "projection"  of climate variables onto a climate index time series. When the climate index is a principal component, the climate pattern is an eigenvector of the covariance matrix, referred to as an Empirical Orthogonal Function  in climate science. Climate prediction A climate prediction or climate forecast is the result of an attempt to produce  an estimate of the actual evolution of the climate in the future, for example, at seasonal, interannual or decadal time scales. Because the future evolution of the climate system may be highly sensitive to initial conditions, such predictions are usually probabilistic in nature. See also Climate projection, Climate scenario, Model initialization and Predictability. Climate projection A climate projection is the simulated response of the climate system to a scenario of future emission or concentration of greenhouse gases and aerosols, generally derived using climate models. Climate projections are distinguished from climate predictions by their dependence on the emission/concentration/radiative forcing scenario used, which is in turn based on assumptions concerning, for example, future socioeconomic and technological developments that may or may not be realized. See also Climate scenario. Climate regime A state of the climate system that occurs more frequently than nearby states due to either more persistence or more frequent recurrence. In other words, a cluster in climate state space associated with a local maximum in the probability density function. Climate response See Climate sensitivity. Climate scenario A plausible and often simplified representation of the future climate, based on an internally consistent set of climatological relationships that has been constructed for explicit use in investigating the potential consequences of anthropogenic climate change, often serving as input to impact models. Climate projections often serve as the raw material for constructing climate scenarios, but climate scenarios usually require additional information such as the observed current climate. A climate change scenario is the difference between a climate scenario and the current climate. See also Emission scenario, scenario. Climate sensitivity In IPCC reports, equilibrium climate sensitivity  refers to the equilibrium  change in the annual global mean surface temperature following a doubling of the atmospheric equivalent carbon dioxide concentration. Owing to computational constraints, the equilibrium climate sensitivity in a climate model is sometimes estimated by running an atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a mixed-layer ocean model, because equilibrium climate sensitivity is largely determined by atmospheric processes. Efficient models can be run to equilibrium with a dynamic ocean. The climate sensitivity parameter -1) refers to the equilibrium change in the annual global mean surface temperature following a unit change in radiative forcing. The effective climate sensitivity  is an estimate of the global mean surface temperature response to doubled carbon dioxide concentration that is evaluated from model output or observations for evolving non-equilibrium conditions. It is a measure of the strengths of the climate feedbacks at a particular time and may vary with forcing history and climate state, and therefore may differ from equilibrium climate sensitivity. The transient climate response  is the change in the global mean surface temperature, averaged over a 20-year period, centred at the time of atmospheric carbon dioxide doubling, in a climate model simulation in which CO2 increases at 1% yr-1. It is a measure of the strength and rapidity of the surface temperature response to greenhouse gas forcing.	0
Climate sensitivity parameter See climate sensitivity. Climate system The climate system is the highly complex system consisting of five major components: the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the lithosphere and the biosphere, and the interactions between them. The climate system evolves in time under the influence of its own internal dynamics and because of external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations and anthropogenic forcings such as the changing composition of the atmosphere and land use change. Climate variability Climate variability refers to variations in the mean state and other statistics  of the climate on all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the climate system , or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external forcing . See also Climate change. Cloud condensation nuclei  The subset of aerosol particles that serve as an initial site for the condensation of liquid water, which can lead to the formation of cloud droplets, under typical cloud formation conditions. The main factor that determines which aerosol particles are CCN at a given supersaturation is their size. Cloud feedback A climate feedback involving changes in any of the properties of clouds as a response to a change in the local or global mean surface temperature. Understanding cloud feedbacks and determining their magnitude and sign require an understanding of how a change in climate may affect the spectrum of cloud types, the cloud fraction and height, the radiative properties of clouds, and finally the Earth's radiation budget. At present, cloud feedbacks remain the largest source of uncertainty in climate sensitivity estimates. See also Cloud radiative effect. Cloud radiative effect The radiative effect of clouds relative to the identical situation without clouds. In previous IPCC reports this was called cloud radiative forcing, but that terminology is inconsistent with other uses of the forcing term and is not maintained in this report. See also Cloud feedback. CO2-equivalent See Equivalent carbon dioxide. Cold days/cold nights Days where maximum temperature, or nights where minimum temperature, falls below the 10th percentile, where the respective temperature distributions are generally defined with respect to the 1961-1990 reference period. For the corresponding indices, see Box 2.4. Compatible emissions Earth System Models that simulate the land and ocean carbon cycle can calculate CO2 emissions that are compatible with a given atmospheric CO2 concentration trajectory. The compatible emissions over a given period of time are equal to the increase of carbon over that same period of time in the sum of the three active reservoirs: the atmosphere, the land and the ocean. Confidence The validity of a finding based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence  and on the degree of agreement. Confidence is expressed qualitatively . See Figure 1.11 for the levels of confidence and Table 1.1 for the list of likelihood qualifiers. See also Uncertainty. Convection Vertical motion driven by buoyancy forces arising from static instability, usually caused by near-surface cooling or increases in salinity in the case of the ocean and near-surface warming or cloud-top radiative cooling in the case of the atmosphere. In the atmosphere convection gives rise to cumulus clouds and precipitation and is effective at both scavenging and vertically transporting chemical species. In the ocean convection can carry surface waters to deep within the ocean. 1451	0
Cosmogenic radioisotopes Rare radioactive isotopes that are created by the interaction of a high-energy cosmic ray particles with atoms nuclei. They are often used as indicator of solar activity which modulates the cosmic rays intensity or as tracers of atmospheric transport processes, and are also called cosmogenic radionuclides. Cryosphere All regions on and beneath the surface of the Earth and ocean where water is in solid form, including sea ice, lake ice, river ice, snow cover, glaciers and ice sheets, and frozen ground . Dansgaard-Oeschger events Abrupt events characterized in Greenland ice cores and in palaeoclimate records from the nearby North Atlantic by a cold glacial state, followed by a rapid transition to a warmer phase, and a slow cooling back to glacial conditions. Counterparts of Dansgaard- Oeschger events are observed in other regions as well. Deforestation Conversion of forest to non-forest. For a discussion of the term forest and related terms such as afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation see the IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry . See also the report on Definitions and Methodological Options to Inventory Emissions from Direct Human-induced Degradation of Forests and Devegetation of Other Vegetation Types .	0
Deglaciation/glacial termination Transitions from full glacial conditions  to warm interglacials characterized by global warming and sea level rise due to change in continental ice volume. Detection and attribution Detection of change is defined as the process of demonstrating that climate or a system affected by climate has changed in some defined statistical sense, without providing a reason for that change. An identified change is detected in observations if its likelihood of occurrence by chance due to internal variability alone is determined to be small, for example, <10%. Attribution is defined as the process of evaluating the relative contributions of multiple causal factors to a change or event with an assignment of statistical confidence . Diatoms Silt-sized algae that live in surface waters of lakes, rivers and oceans and form shells of opal. Their species distribution in ocean cores is often related to past sea surface temperatures. Direct  effect See Aerosol-radiation interaction. Direct Air Capture Chemical process by which a pure CO2 stream is produced by capturing CO2 from the ambient air. Diurnal temperature range The difference between the maximum and minimum temperature during a 24-hour period. Dobson Unit  A unit to measure the total amount of ozone in a vertical column above the Earth's surface . The number of Dobson Units is the thickness in units of 10-5 m that the ozone column would occupy if compressed into a layer of uniform density at a pressure of 1013 hPa and a temperature of 0C. One DU corresponds to a column of ozone containing 2.69 x 1020 molecules per square metre. A typical value for the amount of ozone in a column of the Earth's atmosphere, although very variable, is 300 DU. Downscaling Downscaling is a method that derives local- to regionalscale  information from larger-scale models or data analyses. Two main methods exist: dynamical downscaling and empirical/statistical downscaling. The dynamical method uses the output of regional climate models, global models with variable spatial resolution or high-resolution global models. The empirical/statistical methods develop statistical relationships that link the large-scale atmospheric variables with local/regional	0
climate variables. In all cases, the quality of the driving model remains an important limitation on the quality of the downscaled information. Drought A period of abnormally dry weather long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance. Drought is a relative term; therefore any discussion in terms of precipitation deficit must refer to the particular precipitation-related activity that is under discussion. For example, shortage of precipitation during the growing season impinges on crop production or ecosystem function in general , and during the runoff and percolation season primarily affects water supplies . Storage changes in soil moisture and groundwater are also affected by increases in actual evapotranspiration in addition to reductions in precipitation. A period with an abnormal precipitation deficit is defined as a meteorological drought. A megadrought is a very lengthy and pervasive drought, lasting much longer than normal, usually a decade or more. For the corresponding indices, see Box 2.4. Dynamical system A process or set of processes whose evolution in time is governed by a set of deterministic physical laws. The climate system is a dynamical system. See also Abrupt climate change, Chaotic, Nonlinearity and Predictability. Earth System Model  A coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model in which a representation of the carbon cycle is included, allowing for interactive calculation of atmospheric CO2 or compatible emissions. Additional components  may be included. See also Climate model. Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity  A climate model attempting to include all the most important earth system processes as in ESMs but at a lower resolution or in a simpler, more idealized fashion. Earth System sensitivity The equilibrium temperature response of the coupled atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere-vegetation-carbon cycle system to a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration is referred to as Earth System sensitivity. Because it allows slow components  of the climate system to adjust to the external perturbation, it may differ substantially from the climate sensitivity derived from coupled atmosphere-ocean models. Ecosystem An ecosystem is a functional unit consisting of living organisms, their non-living environment, and the interactions within and between them. The components included in a given ecosystem and its spatial boundaries depend on the purpose for which the ecosystem is defined: in some cases they are relatively sharp, while in others they are diffuse. Ecosystem boundaries can change over time. Ecosystems are nested within other ecosystems, and their scale can range from very small to the entire biosphere. In the current era, most ecosystems either contain people as key organisms, or are influenced by the effects of human activities in their environment. Effective climate sensitivity See Climate sensitivity. Effective radiative forcing See Radiative forcing. Efficacy A measure of how effective a radiative forcing from a given anthropogenic or natural mechanism is at changing the equilibrium global mean surface temperature compared to an equivalent radiative forcing from carbon dioxide. A carbon dioxide increase by definition has an efficacy of 1.0. Variations in climate efficacy may result from rapid adjustments to the applied forcing, which differ with different forcings. Ekman pumping Frictional stress at the surface between two fluids  or between a fluid and the adjacent solid surface  forces a circulation. When the resulting mass	0
transport is converging, mass conservation requires a vertical flow away from the surface. This is called Ekman pumping. The opposite effect, in case of divergence, is called Ekman suction. The effect is important in both the atmosphere and the ocean. Ekman transport The total transport resulting from a balance between the Coriolis force and the frictional stress due to the action of the wind on the ocean surface. See also Ekman pumping. Electromagnetic spectrum Wavelength or energy range of all electromagnetic radiation. In terms of solar radiation, the spectral irradiance is the power arriving at the Earth per unit area, per unit wavelength. El Nino-Southern Oscillation  The term El Nino was initially used to describe a warm-water current that periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting the local fishery. It has since become identified with a basin-wide warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean east of the dateline. This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of a globalscale tropical and subtropical surface pressure pattern called the Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere-ocean phenomenon, with preferred time scales of two to about seven years, is known as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation . It is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between Tahiti and Darwin or the sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade winds weaken, reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents such that the sea surface temperatures warm, further weakening the trade winds. This event has a great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world, through global teleconnections. The cold phase of ENSO is called La Nina. For the corresponding indices, see Box 2.5. Emission scenario A plausible representation of the future development of emissions of substances that are potentially radiatively active  based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about driving forces  and their key relationships. Concentration scenarios, derived from emission scenarios, are used as input to a climate model to compute climate projections. In IPCC  a set of emission scenarios was presented which were used as a basis for the climate projections in IPCC . These emission scenarios are referred to as the IS92 scenarios. In the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios  emission scenarios, the so-called SRES scenarios, were published, some of which were used, among others, as a basis for the climate projections presented in Chapters 9 to 11 of IPCC  and Chapters 10 and 11 of IPCC . New emission scenarios for climate change, the four Representative Concentration Pathways, were developed for, but independently of, the present IPCC assessment. See also Climate scenario and Scenario. Energy balance The difference between the total incoming and total outgoing energy. If this balance is positive, warming occurs; if it is negative, cooling occurs. Averaged over the globe and over long time periods, this balance must be zero. Because the climate system derives virtually all its energy from the Sun, zero balance implies that, globally, the absorbed solar radiation, that is, incoming solar radiation minus reflected solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere and outgoing longwave radiation emitted by the climate system are equal. See also Energy budget. Energy Balance Model  An energy balance model is a simplified model that analyses the energy budget of the Earth to compute changes in the climate. In its simplest form, there is no explicit spatial dimension and the model then provides an estimate of the changes in globally averaged temperature computed from the changes in radiation. This zero-dimensional energy balance model can be extended to a one-	0
dimensional or two-dimensional model if changes to the energy budget with respect to latitude, or both latitude and longitude, are explicitly considered. See also Climate model. Energy budget  The Earth is a physical system with an energy budget that includes all gains of incoming energy and all losses of outgoing energy. The Earth's energy budget is determined by measuring how much energy comes into the Earth system from the Sun, how much energy is lost to space, and accounting for the remainder on Earth and its atmosphere. Solar radiation is the dominant source of energy into the Earth system. Incoming solar energy may be scattered and reflected by clouds and aerosols or absorbed in the atmosphere. The transmitted radiation is then either absorbed or reflected at the Earth's surface. The average albedo of the Earth is about 0.3, which means that 30% of the incident solar energy is reflected into space, while 70% is absorbed by the Earth. Radiant solar or shortwave energy is transformed into sensible heat, latent energy , potential energy, and kinetic energy before being emitted as infrared radiation. With the average surface temperature of the Earth of about 15C , the main outgoing energy flux is in the infrared part of the spectrum. See also Energy balance, Latent heat flux, Sensible heat flux. Ensemble A collection of model simulations characterizing a climate prediction or projection. Differences in initial conditions and model formulation result in different evolutions of the modelled system and may give information on uncertainty associated with model error and error in initial conditions in the case of climate forecasts and on uncertainty associated with model error and with internally generated climate variability in the case of climate projections. Equilibrium and transient climate experiment An equilibrium climate experiment is a climate model experiment in which the model is allowed to fully adjust to a change in radiative forcing. Such experiments provide information on the difference between the initial and final states of the model, but not on the time-dependent response. If the forcing is allowed to evolve gradually according to a prescribed emission scenario, the time-dependent response of a climate model may be analysed. Such an experiment is called a transient climate experiment. See also Climate projection. Equilibrium climate sensitivity See Climate sensitivity. Equilibrium line The spatially averaged boundary at a given moment, usually chosen as the seasonal mass budget minimum at the end of summer, between the region on a glacier where there is a net annual loss of ice mass  and that where there is a net annual gain . The altitude of this boundary is referred to as equilibrium line altitude . Equivalent carbon dioxide  concentration The concentration of carbon dioxide that would cause the same radiative forcing as a given mixture of carbon dioxide and other forcing components. Those values may consider only greenhouse gases, or a combination of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Equivalent carbon dioxide concentration is a metric for comparing radiative forcing of a mix of different greenhouse gases at a particular time but does not imply equivalence of the corresponding climate change responses nor future forcing. There is generally no connection between equivalent carbon dioxide emissions and resulting equivalent carbon dioxide concentrations. Equivalent carbon dioxide  emission The amount of carbon dioxide emission that would cause the same integrated radiative forcing, over a given time horizon, as an emitted amount of a greenhouse gas or a mixture of greenhouse gases. The equivalent carbon dioxide emission is obtained by multiplying the emission of a greenhouse gas by its Global Warming Potential for the given time horizon. For a mix of greenhouse 1453	0
gases it is obtained by summing the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions of each gas. Equivalent carbon dioxide emission is a common scale for comparing emissions of different greenhouse gases but does not imply equivalence of the corresponding climate change responses. See also Equivalent carbon dioxide concentration. Evapotranspiration The combined process of evaporation from the Earth's surface and transpiration from vegetation. Extended Concentration Pathways See Representative Concentration Pathways. External forcing External forcing refers to a forcing agent outside the climate system causing a change in the climate system. Volcanic eruptions, solar variations and anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere and land use change are external forcings. Orbital forcing is also an external forcing as the insolation changes with orbital parameters eccentricity, tilt and precession of the equinox. Extratropical cyclone A large-scale  storm in the middle or high latitudes having low central pressure and fronts with strong horizontal gradients in temperature and humidity. A major cause of extreme wind speeds and heavy precipitation especially in wintertime. Extreme climate event See Extreme weather event. Extreme sea level See Storm surge. AIII	0
Extreme weather event An extreme weather event is an event that is rare at a particular place and time of year. Definitions of rare vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from observations. By definition, the characteristics of what is called extreme weather may vary from place to place in an absolute sense. When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some time, such as a season, it may be classed as an extreme climate event, especially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme . Faculae Bright patches on the Sun. The area covered by faculae is greater during periods of high solar activity. Feedback See Climate feedback. Fingerprint The climate response pattern in space and/or time to a specific forcing is commonly referred to as a fingerprint. The spatial patterns of sea level response to melting of glaciers or ice sheets  are also referred to as fingerprints. Fingerprints are used to detect the presence of this response in observations and are typically estimated using forced climate model simulations. Flux adjustment To avoid the problem of coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models  drifting into some unrealistic climate state, adjustment terms can be applied to the atmosphere-ocean fluxes of heat and moisture  before these fluxes are imposed on the model ocean and atmosphere. Because these adjustments are pre-computed and therefore independent of the coupled model integration, they are uncorrelated with the anomalies that develop during the integration. Forest A vegetation type dominated by trees. Many definitions of the term forest are in use throughout the world, reflecting wide differences in biogeophysical conditions, social structure and economics. For a discussion of the term forest and related terms such as afforestation, reforestation and deforestation see the IPCC Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry . See also the Report on Definitions and M  ethodological Options to Inventory Emissions from Direct Human-induced Degradation of Forests and Devegetation of Other Vegetation Types . 1454	0
Fossil fuel emissions Emissions of greenhouse gases , other trace gases and aerosols resulting from the combustion of fuels from fossil carbon deposits such as oil, gas and coal. Framework Convention on Climate Change See United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change . Free atmosphere The atmospheric layer that is negligibly affected by friction against the Earth's surface, and which is above the atmospheric boundary layer. Frozen ground Soil or rock in which part or all of the pore water is frozen. Frozen ground includes permafrost. Ground that freezes and thaws annually is called seasonally frozen ground. General circulation The large-scale motions of the atmosphere and the ocean as a consequence of differential heating on a rotating Earth. General circulation contributes to the energy balance of the system through transport of heat and momentum. General Circulation Model  See Climate model. Geoengineering Geoengineering refers to a broad set of methods and technologies that aim to deliberately alter the climate system in order to alleviate the impacts of climate change. Most, but not all, methods seek to either  reduce the amount of absorbed solar energy in the climate system  or  increase net carbon sinks from the atmosphere at a scale sufficiently large to alter climate . Scale and intent are of central importance. Two key characteristics of geoengineering methods of particular concern are that they use or affect the climate system  globally or regionally and/or could have substantive unintended effects that cross national boundaries. Geoengineering is different from weather modification and ecological engineering, but the boundary can be fuzzy . Geoid The equipotential surface having the same geopotential at each latitude and longitude around the world  that best approximates the mean sea level. It is the surface of reference for measurement of altitude. In practice, several variations of definitions of the geoid exist depending on the way the permanent tide  is considered in geodetic studies. Geostrophic winds or currents A wind or current that is in balance with the horizontal pressure gradient and the Coriolis force, and thus is outside of the influence of friction. Thus, the wind or current is directly parallel to isobars and its speed is proportional to the horizontal pressure gradient. Glacial-interglacial cycles Phase of the Earth's history marked by large changes in continental ice volume and global sea level. See also Ice age and Interglacials. Glacial isostatic adjustment  The deformation of the Earth and its gravity field due to the response of the earth-ocean system to changes in ice and associated water loads. It is sometimes referred to as glacio-hydro isostasy. It includes vertical and horizontal deformations of the Earth's surface and changes in geoid due to the redistribution of mass during the ice-ocean mass exchange. Glacier A perennial mass of land ice that originates from compressed snow, shows evidence of past or present flow  and is constrained by internal stress and friction at the base and sides. A glacier is maintained by accumulation of snow at high altitudes, balanced by melting at low altitudes and/or discharge into the sea. An ice mass of the same origin as glaciers, but of continental size, is called an ice sheet. For the purpose of simplicity in this Assessment Report, all ice masses other than ice sheets are referred to as	0
Global mean surface temperature An estimate of the global mean surface air temperature. However, for changes over time, only anomalies, as departures from a climatology, are used, most commonly based on the area-weighted global average of the sea surface temperature anomaly and land surface air temperature anomaly. Global Warming Potential  An index, based on radiative properties of greenhouse gases, measuring the radiative forcing following a pulse emission of a unit mass of a given greenhouse gas in the presentday atmosphere integrated over a chosen time horizon, relative to that of carbon dioxide. The GWP represents the combined effect of the differing times these gases remain in the atmosphere and their relative effectiveness in causing radiative forcing. The Kyoto Protocol is based on GWPs from pulse emissions over a 100-year time frame. Greenhouse effect The infrared radiative effect of all infrared-absorbing constituents in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, clouds, and  aerosols absorb terrestrial radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and elsewhere in the atmosphere. These substances emit infrared radiation in all directions, but, everything else being equal, the net amount emitted to space is normally less than would have been emitted in the absence of these absorbers because of the decline of temperature with altitude in the troposphere and the consequent weakening of emission. An increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases increases the magnitude of this effect; the difference is sometimes called the enhanced greenhouse effect. The change in a greenhouse gas concentration because of anthropogenic emissions contributes to an instantaneous radiative forcing. Surface temperature and troposphere warm in response to this forcing, gradually restoring the radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas  Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of terrestrial radiation emitted by the Earth's surface, the atmosphere itself, and by clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapour , carbon dioxide , nitrous oxide , methane  and ozone  are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Moreover, there are a number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and brominecontaining substances, dealt with under the Montreal Protocol. Beside CO2, N2O and CH4, the Kyoto Protocol deals with the greenhouse gases sulphur hexafluoride , hydrofluorocarbons  and perfluorocarbons . For a list of well-mixed greenhouse gases, see Table 2.A.1. Gross Primary Production  The amount of carbon fixed by the autotrophs . Grounding line The junction between a glacier or ice sheet and ice shelf; the place where ice starts to float. This junction normally occurs over a finite zone, rather than at a line. Gyre Basin-scale ocean horizontal circulation pattern with slow flow circulating around the ocean basin, closed by a strong and narrow  boundary current on the western side. The subtropical gyres in each ocean are associated with high pressure in the centre of the gyres; the subpolar gyres are associated with low pressure. Hadley Circulation A direct, thermally driven overturning cell in the atmosphere consisting of poleward flow in the upper troposphere, subsiding air into the subtropical anticyclones, return flow as part of the trade	0
Halocline A layer in the oceanic water column in which salinity changes rapidly with depth. Generally saltier water is denser and lies below less salty water. In some high latitude oceans the surface waters may be colder than the deep waters and the halocline is responsible for maintaining water column stability and isolating the surface waters from the deep waters. See also Thermocline. Halosteric See Sea level change. HCFC See Halocarbons. Heat wave A period of abnormally and uncomfortably hot weather. See also Warm spell. Heterotrophic respiration The conversion of organic matter to carbon dioxide by organisms other than autotrophs. HFC See Halocarbons. Hindcast or retrospective forecast A forecast made for a period in the past using only information available before the beginning of the forecast. A sequence of hindcasts can be used to calibrate the forecast system and/or provide a measure of the average skill that the forecast system has exhibited in the past as a guide to the skill that might be expected in the future. Holocene The Holocene Epoch is the latter of two epochs in the Quaternary System, extending from 11.65 ka  to the present. It is also known as Marine Isotopic Stage  1 or current interglacial. Hydroclimate Part of the climate pertaining to the hydrology of a region. Hydrological cycle The cycle in which water evaporates from the oceans and the land surface, is carried over the Earth in atmospheric circulation as water vapour, condenses to form clouds, precipitates over ocean and land as rain or snow, which on land can be intercepted by trees and vegetation, provides runoff on the land surface, infiltrates into soils, recharges groundwater, discharges into streams and ultimately flows out into the oceans, from which it will eventually evaporate again. The various systems involved in the hydrological cycle are usually referred to as hydrological systems. Hydrosphere The component of the climate system comprising liquid surface and subterranean water, such as oceans, seas, rivers, fresh water lakes, underground water, etc. Hypsometry The distribution of land or ice surface as a function of altitude. Ice age An ice age or glacial period is characterized by a long-term reduction in the temperature of the Earth's climate, resulting in growth of ice sheets and glaciers. Ice-albedo feedback A climate feedback involving changes in the Earth's surface albedo. Snow and ice have an albedo much higher  than the average planetary albedo . With increasing temperatures, it is anticipated that snow and ice extent will decrease, the Earth's overall albedo will decrease and more solar radiation will be absorbed, warming the Earth further. 1455	0
Ice sheet A mass of land ice of continental size that is sufficiently thick to cover most of the underlying bed, so that its shape is mainly determined by its dynamics . An ice sheet flows outward from a high central ice plateau with a small average surface slope. The margins usually slope more steeply, and most ice is discharged through fast flowing ice streams or outlet glaciers, in some cases into the sea or into ice shelves floating on the sea. There are only two ice sheets in the modern world, one on Greenland and one on Antarctica. During glacial periods there were others. Ice shelf A floating slab of ice of considerable thickness extending from the coast , often filling embayments in the coastline of an ice sheet. Nearly all ice shelves are in Antarctica, where most of the ice discharged into the ocean flows via ice shelves. Ice stream A stream of ice with strongly enhanced flow that is part of an ice sheet. It is often separated from surrounding ice by strongly sheared, crevassed margins. See also Outlet glacier. Incoming solar radiation See Insolation.	0
Indian Ocean Dipole  Large-scale mode of interannual variability of sea surface temperature in the Indian Ocean. This pattern manifests through a zonal gradient of tropical sea surface temperature, which in one extreme phase in boreal autumn shows cooling off Sumatra and warming off Somalia in the west, combined with anomalous easterlies along the equator. Indirect aerosol effect See Aerosol-cloud interaction. Industrial Revolution A period of rapid industrial growth with farreaching social and economic consequences, beginning in Britain during the second half of the 18th century and spreading to Europe and later to other countries including the United States. The invention of the steam engine was an important trigger of this development. The industrial revolution marks the beginning of a strong increase in the use of fossil fuels and emission of, in particular, fossil carbon dioxide. In this report the terms preindustrial and industrial refer, somewhat arbitrarily, to the periods before and after 1750, respectively. Infrared radiation See Terrestrial radiation. Insolation The amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth by latitude and by season measured in W m-2. Usually insolation refers to the radiation arriving at the top of the atmosphere. Sometimes it is specified as referring to the radiation arriving at the Earth's surface. See also Total Solar Irradiance. Interglacials or interglaciations The warm periods between ice age glaciations. Often defined as the periods at which sea levels were close to present sea level. For the Last Interglacial  this occurred between about 129 and 116 ka  before present  although the warm period started in some areas a few thousand years earlier. In terms of the oxygen isotope record interglaciations are defined as the interval between the midpoint of the preceding termination and the onset of the next glaciation. The present interglaciation, the Holocene, started at 11.65 ka before present although globally sea levels did not approach their present position until about 7 ka before present. Internal variability See Climate variability. Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone  The Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone is an equatorial zonal belt of low pressure, strong convection and heavy precipitation near the equator where the northeast trade winds meet the southeast trade winds. This band moves seasonally. 1456	0
Iron fertilization Deliberate introduction of iron to the upper ocean intended to enhance biological productivity which can sequester additional atmospheric carbon dioxide into the oceans. Irreversibility A perturbed state of a dynamical system is defined as irreversible on a given timescale, if the recovery timescale from this state due to natural processes is significantly longer than the time it takes for the system to reach this perturbed state. In the context of WGI, the time scale of interest is centennial to millennial. See also Tipping point. Isostatic or Isostasy Isostasy refers to the response of the earth to changes in surface load. It includes the deformational and gravitational response. This response is elastic on short time scales, as in the earth- ocean response to recent changes in mountain glaciation, or viscoelastic on longer time scales, as in the response to the last deglaciation following the Last Glacial Maximum. See also Glacial Isostatic Adjustment . Isotopes Atoms of the same chemical element that have the same the number of protons but differ in the number of neutrons. Some proton- neutron configurations are stable , others are unstable undergoing spontaneous radioactive decay . Most elements have more than one stable isotope. Isotopes can be used to trace transport processes or to study processes that change the isotopic ratio. Radioisotopes provide in addition time information that can be used for radiometric dating. Kyoto Protocol The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  was adopted in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, at the Third Session of the Conference of the Parties  to the UNFCCC. It contains legally binding commitments, in addition to those included in the UNFCCC. Countries included in Annex B of the Protocol  agreed to reduce their anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions  by at least 5% below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008-2012. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005. Land surface air temperature The surface air temperature as measured in well-ventilated screens over land at 1.5 m above the ground. Land use and Land use change Land use refers to the total of arrangements, activities and inputs undertaken in a certain land cover type . The term land use is also used in the sense of the social and economic purposes for which land is managed . Land use change refers to a change in the use or management of land by humans, which may lead to a change in land cover. Land cover and land use change may have an impact on the surface albedo, evapotranspiration, sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, or other properties of the climate system and may thus give rise to radiative forcing and/or other impacts on climate, locally or globally. See also the IPCC Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry . Land water storage Water stored on land other than in glaciers and ice sheets . Changes in land water storage driven by climate and human activities contribute to sea level change. La Nina See El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Lapse rate The rate of change of an atmospheric variable, usually temperature, with height. The lapse rate is considered positive when the variable decreases with height. Last Glacial Maximum  The period during the last ice age when the glaciers and ice sheets reached their maximum extent, a pproximately	0
21 ka ago. This period has been widely studied because the radiative forcings and boundary conditions are relatively well known. Last Interglacial  See Interglacials. Latent heat flux The turbulent flux of heat from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere that is associated with evaporation or condensation of water vapour at the surface; a component of the surface energy budget. Lifetime Lifetime is a general term used for various time scales characterizing the rate of processes affecting the concentration of trace gases. The following lifetimes may be distinguished: Turnover time   is the ratio of the mass M of a reservoir  and the total rate of removal S from the reservoir: T = M/S. For each removal process, separate turnover times can be defined. In soil carbon biology, this is referred to as Mean Residence Time. Adjustment time or response time  is the time scale characterizing the decay of an instantaneous pulse input into the reservoir. The term adjustment time is also used to characterize the adjustment of the mass of a reservoir following a step change in the source strength. Half-life or decay constant is used to quantify a first-order exponential decay process. See Response time for a different definition pertinent to climate variations. The term lifetime is sometimes used, for simplicity, as a surrogate for adjustment time. In simple cases, where the global removal of the compound is directly proportional to the total mass of the reservoir, the adjustment time equals the turnover time: T = Ta. An example is CFC-11, which is removed from the atmosphere only by photochemical processes in the stratosphere. In more complicated cases, where several reservoirs are involved or where the removal is not proportional to the total mass, the equality T = Ta no longer holds. Carbon dioxide  is an extreme example. Its turnover time is only about 4 years because of the rapid exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean and terrestrial biota. However, a large part of that CO2 is returned to the atmosphere within a few years. Thus, the adjustment time of CO2 in the atmosphere is actually determined by the rate of removal of carbon from the surface layer of the oceans into its deeper layers. Although an approximate value of 100 years may be given for the adjustment time of CO2 in the atmosphere, the actual adjustment is faster initially and slower later on. In the case of methane , the adjustment time is different from the turnover time because the removal is mainly through a chemical reaction with the hydroxyl radical , the concentration of which itself depends on the CH4 concentration. Therefore, the CH4 removal rate S is not proportional to its total mass M. Likelihood The chance of a specific outcome occurring, where this might be estimated probabilistically. This is expressed in this report using a standard terminology, defined in Table 1.1. See also Confidence and Uncertainty. Lithosphere The upper layer of the solid Earth, both continental and oceanic, which comprises all crustal rocks and the cold, mainly elastic part of the uppermost mantle. Volcanic activity, although part of the lithosphere, is not considered as part of the climate system, but acts as an external forcing factor. See also Isostatic. Little Ice Age  An interval during the last millennium characterized by a number of extensive expansions of mountain glaciers and moderate retreats in between them, both in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The timing of glacial advances differs between regions and the LIA is, therefore, not clearly defined in time. Most definitions lie in the	0
period 1400 CE and 1900 CE. Currently available reconstructions of average Northern Hemisphere temperature indicate that the coolest periods at the hemispheric scale may have occurred from 1450 to 1850 CE. Longwave radiation See Terrestrial radiation. Madden-Julian Oscillation  The largest single component of tropical atmospheric intraseasonal variability . The MJO propagates eastwards at around 5 m s-1 in the form of a largescale coupling between atmospheric circulation and deep convection. As it progresses, it is associated with large regions of both enhanced and suppressed rainfall, mainly over the Indian and western Pacific Oceans. Each MJO event lasts approximately 30 to 60 days, hence the MJO is also known as the 30- to 60-day wave, or the intraseasonal oscillation. Marine-based ice sheet An ice sheet containing a substantial region that rests on a bed lying below sea level and whose perimeter is in contact with the ocean. The best known example is the West Antarctic ice sheet. Mass balance/budget  The balance between the mass input to the ice body  and the mass loss  over a stated period of time, which is often a year or a season. Point mass balance refers to the mass balance at a particular location on the glacier or ice sheet. Surface mass balance is the difference between surface accumulation and surface ablation. The input and output terms for mass balance are: Accumulation All processes that add to the mass of a glacier. The main contribution to accumulation is snowfall. Accumulation also includes deposition of hoar, freezing rain, other types of solid precipitation, gain of wind-blown snow, and avalanching. Ablation Surface processes that reduce the mass of a glacier. The main contributor to ablation is melting with runoff but on some glaciers sublimation, loss of wind-blown snow and avalanching are also significant processes of ablation. Discharge/outflow Mass loss by iceberg calving or ice discharge across the grounding line of a floating ice shelf. Although often treated as an ablation term, in this report iceberg calving and discharge is considered separately from surface ablation. Mean sea level The surface level of the ocean at a particular point averaged over an extended period of time such as a month or year. Mean sea level is often used as a national datum to which heights on land are referred. Medieval Climate Anomaly  See Medieval Warm Period. Medieval Warm Period  An interval of relatively warm conditions and other notable climate anomalies such as more extensive drought in some continental regions. The timing of this interval is not clearly defined, with different records showing onset and termination of the warmth at different times, and some showing intermittent warmth. Most definitions lie within the period 900 to 1400 CE. Currently available reconstructions of average Northern Hemisphere temperature indicate that the warmest period at the hemispheric scale may have occurred from 950 to 1250 CE. Currently available records and temperature reconstructions indicate that average temperatures during parts of the MWP were indeed warmer in the context of the last 2 kyr, though the warmth may not have been as ubiquitous across seasons and geographical regions as the 20th century warming. It is also called Medieval Climate Anomaly. Meridional Overturning Circulation  Meridional  overturning circulation in the ocean quantified by zonal  sums of mass transports in depth or density layers. In the North Atlantic, away from the subpolar regions, the MOC  is often identified with the thermohaline circulation , 1457	0
Mole fraction Mole fraction, or mixing ratio, is the ratio of the number of moles of a constituent in a given volume to the total number of moles of all constituents in that volume. It is usually reported for dry air. Typical values for well-mixed greenhouse gases are in the order of mol mol-1 , nmol mol-1 , and fmol mol-1 . Mole fraction differs from volume mixing ratio, often expressed in ppmv etc., by the corrections for non-ideality of gases. This correction is significant relative to measurement precision for many greenhouse gases .	0
Microwave Sounding Unit  A microwave sounder on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  polar orbiter satellites, that estimates the temperature of thick layers of the atmosphere by measuring the thermal emission of oxygen molecules from a complex of emission lines near 60 GHz. A series of nine MSUs began making this kind of measurement in late 1978. Beginning in mid 1998, a follow-on series of instruments, the Advanced Microwave Sounding Units , began operation. Mineralization/Remineralization The conversion of an element from its organic form to an inorganic form as a result of microbial decomposition. In nitrogen mineralization, organic nitrogen from decaying plant and animal residues  is converted to ammonia  and ammonium  by biological activity. Mitigation A human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases. Mixing ratio See Mole fraction. Model drift Since model climate differs to some extent from observed climate, climate forecasts will typically `drift' from the initial observationbased state towards the model's climate. This drift occurs at different time scales for different variables, can obscure the initial-condition forecast information and is usually removed a posteriori by an empirical, usually linear, adjustment. Model hierarchy	0
Model initialization A climate forecast typically proceeds by integrating a climate model forward in time from an initial state that is intended to reflect the actual state of the climate system. Available observations of the climate system are `assimilated' into the model. Initialization is a complex process that is limited by available observations, observational errors and, depending on the procedure used, may be affected by uncertainty in the history of climate forcing. The initial conditions will contain errors that grow as the forecast progresses, thereby limiting the time for which the forecast will be useful. See also Climate prediction. Model spread The range or spread in results from climate models, such as those assembled for Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 . Does not necessarily provide an exhaustive and formal estimate of the uncertainty in feedbacks, forcing or projections even when expressed numerically, for example, by computing a standard deviation of the models' responses. In order to quantify uncertainty, information from observations, physical constraints and expert judgement must be combined, using a statistical framework. 1458	0
Monsoon A monsoon is a tropical and subtropical seasonal reversal in both the surface winds and associated precipitation, caused by differential heating between a continental-scale land mass and the adjacent ocean. Monsoon rains occur mainly over land in summer. Montreal Protocol The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was adopted in Montreal in 1987, and subsequently adjusted and amended in London , Copenhagen , Vienna , Montreal  and Beijing . It controls the consumption and production of chlorine- and bromine-containing chemicals that destroy stratospheric ozone, such as chlorofluorocarbons, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and many others. Near-surface permafrost A term frequently used in climate model applications to refer to permafrost at depths close to the ground surface . In modelling studies, near-surface permafrost is usually diagnosed from 20 or 30 year climate averages, which is different from the conventional definition of permafrost. Disappearance of near-surface permafrost in a location does not preclude the longer-term persistence of permafrost at greater depth. See also Active layer, Frozen ground and Thermokarst. Near-term climate forcers  Near-term climate forcers  refer to those compounds whose impact on climate occurs primarily within the first decade after their emission. This set of compounds is primarily composed of those with short lifetimes in the atmosphere compared to well-mixed greenhouse gases, and has been sometimes referred to as short lived climate forcers or short-lived climate pollutants. However, the common property that is of greatest interest to a climate assessment is the timescale over which their impact on climate is felt. This set of compounds includes methane, which is also a well-mixed greenhouse gas, as well as ozone and aerosols, or their precursors, and some halogenated species that are not well-mixed greenhouse gases. These compounds do not accumulate in the atmosphere at decadal to centennial timescales, and so their effect on climate is predominantly in the near term following their emission. Nitrogen deposition Nitrogen deposition is defined as the nitrogen transferred from the atmosphere to the Earth's surface by the processes of wet deposition and dry deposition. Nitrous oxide  One of the six greenhouse gases to be mitigated under the Kyoto Protocol. The main anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide is agriculture , but important contributions also come from sewage treatment, combustion of fossil fuel, and chemical industrial processes. Nitrous oxide is also produced naturally from a wide variety of biological sources in soil and water, particularly microbial action in wet tropical forests.	0
Pacific decadal variability Coupled decadal-to-inter-decadal variability of the atmospheric circulation and underlying ocean in the Pacific Basin. It is most prominent in the North Pacific, where fluctuations in the strength of the winter Aleutian Low pressure system co-vary with North Pacific sea surface temperatures, and are linked to decadal variations in atmospheric circulation, sea surface temperatures and ocean circulation throughout the whole Pacific Basin. Such fluctuations have the effect of modulating the El Nino-Southern Oscillation cycle. Key measures of Pacific decadal variability are the North Pacific Index , the Pacific Decadal Oscillation  index and the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation  index, all defined in Box 2.5.	0
Northern Annular Mode  A winter fluctuation in the amplitude of a pattern characterized by low surface pressure in the Arctic and strong mid-latitude westerlies. The NAM has links with the northern polar vortex into the stratosphere. Its pattern has a bias to the North Atlantic and its index has a large correlation with the North Atlantic Oscillation index. See NAM Index, Box 2.5. Ocean acidification Ocean acidification refers to a reduction in the pH of the ocean over an extended period, typically decades or longer, which is caused primarily by uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but can also be caused by other chemical additions or subtractions from the ocean. Anthropogenic ocean acidification refers to the component of pH reduction that is caused by human activity . Ocean heat uptake efficiency This is a measure  of the rate at which heat storage by the global ocean increases as global mean surface temperature rises. It is a useful parameter for climate change experiments in which the radiative forcing is changing monotonically, when it can be compared with the Climate Feedback Parameter to gauge the relative importance of climate response and ocean heat uptake in determining the rate of climate change. It can be estimated from such an experiment as the ratio of the rate of increase of ocean heat content to the global mean surface air temperature change. Organic aerosol Component of the aerosol that consists of organic compounds, mainly carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and lesser amounts of other elements. See also Carbonaceous aerosol. Outgoing longwave radiation Net outgoing radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum at the top of the atmosphere. See also Terrestrial radiation. Outlet glacier A glacier, usually between rock walls, that is part of, and drains an ice sheet. See also Ice stream. Ozone Ozone, the triatomic form of oxygen , is a gaseous atmospheric constituent. In the troposphere, it is created both naturally and by photochemical reactions involving gases resulting from human activities . Tropospheric ozone acts as a greenhouse gas. In the stratosphere, it is created by the interaction between solar ultraviolet radiation and molecular oxygen . Stratospheric ozone plays a dominant role in the stratospheric radiative balance. Its concentration is highest in the ozone layer. Ozone hole See Ozone layer. Ozone layer The stratosphere contains a layer in which the concentration of ozone is greatest, the so-called ozone layer. The layer extends from about 12 to 40 km above the Earth's surface. The ozone concentration reaches a maximum between about 20 and 25 km. This layer has been depleted by human emissions of chlorine and bromine compounds. Every year, during the Southern Hemisphere spring, a very strong depletion of the ozone layer takes place over the Antarctic, caused by anthropogenic chlorine and bromine compounds in combination with the specific meteorological conditions of that region. This phenomenon is called the Ozone hole. See also Montreal Protocol.	0
Pacific-North American  pattern An atmospheric large-scale wave pattern featuring a sequence of tropospheric high and low pressure anomalies stretching from the subtropical west Pacific to the east coast of North America. See PNA pattern index, Box 2.5. Paleoclimate Climate during periods prior to the development of measuring instruments, including historic and geologic time, for which only proxy climate records are available. Parameterization In climate models, this term refers to the technique of representing processes that cannot be explicitly resolved at the spatial or temporal resolution of the model  by relationships between model-resolved larger-scale variables and the area- or timeaveraged effect of such subgrid scale processes. Percentiles The set of partition values which divides the total population of a distribution into 100 equal parts, the 50th percentile corresponding to the median of the population. Permafrost Ground  that remains at or below 0C for at least two consecutive years. See also Near-surface permafrost. pH pH is a dimensionless measure of the acidity of water  given by its concentration of hydrogen ions . pH is measured on a logarithmic scale where pH = -log10. Thus, a pH decrease of 1 unit corresponds to a 10-fold increase in the concentration of H+, or acidity. Photosynthesis The process by which plants take carbon dioxide from the air  to build carbohydrates, releasing oxygen in the process. There are several pathways of photosynthesis with different responses to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. See also Carbon dioxide fertilization. Plankton Microorganisms living in the upper layers of aquatic systems. A distinction is made between phytoplankton, which depend on photosynthesis for their energy supply, and zooplankton, which feed on phytoplankton. Pleistocene The Pleistocene Epoch is the earlier of two epochs in the Quaternary System, extending from 2.59 Ma to the beginning of the Holocene at 11.65 ka. Pliocene The Plionece Epoch is the last epoch of the Neogene System and extends from 5.33 Ma to the beginning of the Pleistocene at 2.59 Ma. Pollen analysis A technique of both relative dating and environmental reconstruction, consisting of the identification and counting of pollen types preserved in peat, lake sediments and other deposits. See also Proxy.	0
Precipitable water The total amount of atmospheric water vapour in a vertical column of unit cross-sectional area. It is commonly expressed in terms of the height of the water if completely condensed and collected in a vessel of the same unit cross section. Precursors Atmospheric compounds that are not greenhouse gases or aerosols, but that have an effect on greenhouse gas or aerosol concentrations by taking part in physical or chemical processes regulating their production or destruction rates. Predictability The extent to which future states of a system may be predicted based on knowledge of current and past states of the system. Because knowledge of the climate system's past and current states is generally imperfect, as are the models that utilize this knowledge to produce a climate prediction, and because the climate system is inherently nonlinear and chaotic, predictability of the climate system is inherently limited. Even with arbitrarily accurate models and observations, there may still be limits to the predictability of such a nonlinear system . Prediction quality/skill Measures of the success of a prediction against observationally based information. No single measure can summarize all aspects of forecast quality and a suite of metrics is considered. Metrics will differ for forecasts given in deterministic and probabilistic form. See also Climate prediction. Pre-industrial See Industrial Revolution. AIII	0
Probability Density Function  A probability density function is a function that indicates the relative chances of occurrence of different outcomes of a variable. The function integrates to unity over the domain for which it is defined and has the property that the integral over a subdomain equals the probability that the outcome of the variable lies within that sub-domain. For example, the probability that a temperature anomaly defined in a particular way is greater than zero is obtained from its PDF by integrating the PDF over all possible temperature anomalies greater than zero. Probability density functions that describe two or more variables simultaneously are similarly defined. Process-based Model Theoretical concepts and computational methods that represent and simulate the behaviour of real-world systems derived from a set of functional components and their interactions with each other and the system environment, through physical and mechanistic processes occurring over time. See also Climate model. Projection A projection is a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Unlike predictions, projections are conditional on assumptions concerning, for example, future socioeconomic and technological developments that may or may not be realized. See also Climate prediction and Climate projection. Proxy A proxy climate indicator is a record that is interpreted, using physical and biophysical principles, to represent some combination of climate-related variations back in time. Climate-related data derived in this way are referred to as proxy data. Examples of proxies include pollen analysis, tree ring records, speleothems, characteristics of corals and various data derived from marine sediments and ice cores. Proxy-data can be calibrated to provide quantitative climate information. Quasi-Biennal Oscillation  A near-periodic oscillation of the equatorial zonal wind between easterlies and westerlies in the tropical stratosphere with a mean period of around 28 months. The alternating wind maxima descend from the base of the mesosphere down to the tropopause, and are driven by wave energy that propagates up from the troposphere. Quaternary The Quaternary System is the latter of three systems that make up the Cenozoic Era , extending from 2.59 Ma to the present, and includes the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. 1460	0
Radiative effect The impact on a radiation flux or heating rate  caused by the interaction of a particular constituent with either the infrared or solar radiation fields through absorption, scattering and emission, relative to an otherwise identical atmosphere free of that constituent. This quantifies the impact of the constituent on the climate system. Examples include the aerosol-radiation interactions, cloud radiative effect, and greenhouse effect. In this report, the portion of any top-of-atmosphere radiative effect that is due to anthropogenic or other external influences  is termed the instantaneous radiative forcing. Radiative forcing Radiative forcing is the change in the net, downward minus upward, radiative flux  at the tropopause or top of atmosphere due to a change in an external driver of climate change, such as, for example, a change in the concentration of carbon dioxide or the output of the Sun. Sometimes internal drivers are still treated as forcings even though they result from the alteration in climate, for example aerosol or greenhouse gas changes in paleoclimates. The traditional radiative forcing is computed with all tropospheric properties held fixed at their unperturbed values, and after allowing for stratospheric temperatures, if perturbed, to readjust to radiative-dynamical equilibrium. Radiative forcing is called instantaneous if no change in stratospheric temperature is accounted for. The radiative forcing once rapid adjustments are accounted for is termed the effective radiative forcing. For the purposes of this report, radiative forcing is further defined as the change relative to the year 1750 and, unless otherwise noted, refers to a global and annual average value. Radiative forcing is not to be confused with cloud radiative forcing, which describes an unrelated measure of the impact of clouds on the radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere. Rapid adjustment The response to an agent perturbing the climate system that is driven directly by the agent, independently of any change in the global mean surface temperature. For example, carbon dioxide and aerosols, by altering internal heating and cooling rates within the atmosphere, can each cause changes to cloud cover and other variables thereby producing a radiative effect even in the absence of any surface warming or cooling. Adjustments are rapid in the sense that they begin to occur right away, before climate feedbacks which are driven by warming . It is also called the rapid response or fast adjustment. For further explanation on the concept, see Sections 7.1 and 8.1. Rapid climate change See Abrupt climate change. Rapid dynamical change  Changes in glacier or ice sheet mass controlled by changes in flow speed and discharge rather than by accumulation or ablation. This can result in a rate of mass change larger than that due to any imbalance between accumulation and ablation. Rapid dynamical change may be initiated by a climatic trigger, such as incursion of warm ocean water beneath an ice shelf, or thinning of a grounded tidewater terminus, which may lead to reactions within the glacier system, that may result in rapid ice loss. See also Mass balance/budget . Reanalysis Reanalyses are estimates of historical atmospheric temperature and wind or oceanographic temperature and current, and other quantities, created by processing past meteorological or oceanographic data using fixed state-of-the-art weather forecasting or ocean circulation models with data assimilation techniques. Using fixed data assimilation avoids effects from the changing analysis system that occur in operational analyses. Although continuity is improved, global reanalyses still suffer from changing coverage and biases in the observing systems.	0
Rebound effect When CO2 is removed from the atmosphere, the CO2 concentration gradient between atmospheric and land/ocean carbon reservoirs is reduced. This leads to a reduction or reversal in subsequent inherent rate of removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by natural carbon cycle processes on land and ocean. Reconstruction  Approach to reconstructing the past temporal and spatial characteristics of a climate variable from predictors. The predictors can be instrumental data if the reconstruction is used to infill missing data or proxy data if it is used to develop paleoclimate reconstructions. Various techniques have been developed for this purpose: linear multivariate regression based methods and nonlinear Bayesian and analog methods. Reforestation Planting of forests on lands that have previously contained forests but that have been converted to some other use. For a discussion of the term forest and related terms such as afforestation, reforestation and deforestation, see the IPCC Report on Land Use, LandUse Change and Forestry . See also the Report on Definitions and Methodological Options to Inventory Emissions from Direct Humaninduced Degradation of Forests and Devegetation of Other Vegetation Types . Region A region is a territory characterized by specific geographical and climatological features. The climate of a region is affected by regional and local scale features like topography, land use characteristics and lakes, as well as remote influences from other regions. See also Teleconnection. Regional Climate Model  A climate model at higher resolution over a limited area. Such models are used in downscaling global climate results over specific regional domains. Relative humidity The relative humidity specifies the ratio of actual water vapour pressure to that at saturation with respect to liquid water or ice at the same temperature. See also Specific humidity. Relative sea level Sea level measured by a tide gauge with respect to the land upon which it is situated. See also Mean sea level and Sea level change. Representative Concentration Pathways  Scenarios that include time series of emissions and concentrations of the full suite of greenhouse gases and aerosols and chemically active gases, as well as land use/land cover . The word representative signifies that each RCP provides only one of many possible scenarios that would lead to the specific radiative forcing characteristics. The term pathway emphasizes that not only the long-term concentration levels are of interest, but also the trajectory taken over time to reach that outcome. . RCPs usually refer to the portion of the concentration pathway extending up to 2100, for which Integrated Assessment Models produced corresponding emission scenarios. Extended Concentration Pathways  describe extensions of the RCPs from 2100 to 2500 that were calculated using simple rules generated by stakeholder consultations, and do not represent fully consistent scenarios. Four RCPs produced from Integrated Assessment Models were selected from the published literature and are used in the present IPCC Assessment as a basis for the climate predictions and projections presented in Chapters 11 to 14: RCP2.6 One pathway where radiative forcing peaks at approximately 3 W m-2 before 2100 and then declines  RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 Two intermediate stabilization pathways in which radiative forcing is stabilized at approximately 4.5 W m-2 and 6.0 W m-2 after 2100 	0
RCP8.5 One high pathway for which radiative forcing reaches greater than 8.5 W m-2 by 2100 and continues to rise for some amount of time  For further description of future scenarios, see Box 1.1. Reservoir A component of the climate system, other than the atmosphere, which has the capacity to store, accumulate or release a substance of concern, for example, carbon, a greenhouse gas or a precursor. Oceans, soils and forests are examples of reservoirs of carbon. Pool is an equivalent term . The absolute quantity of the substance of concern held within a reservoir at a specified time is called the stock. Resolution In climate models, this term refers to the physical distance  between each point on the grid used to compute the equations. Temporal resolution refers to the time step or time elapsed between each model computation of the equations. Respiration The process whereby living organisms convert organic matter to carbon dioxide, releasing energy and consuming molecular oxygen. Response time The response time or adjustment time is the time needed for the climate system or its components to re-equilibrate to a new state, following a forcing resulting from external processes. It is very different for various components of the climate system. The response time of the troposphere is relatively short, from days to weeks, whereas the stratosphere reaches equilibrium on a time scale of typically a few months. Due to their large heat capacity, the oceans have a much longer response time: typically decades, but up to centuries or millennia. The response time of the strongly coupled surface-troposphere system is, therefore, slow compared to that of the stratosphere, and mainly determined by the oceans. The biosphere may respond quickly , but also very slowly to imposed changes. See lifetime for a different definition of response time pertinent to the rate of processes affecting the concentration of trace gases. Return period An estimate of the average time interval between occurrences of an event  of  a defined size or intensity. See also Return value. Return value The highest  value of a given variable, on average occurring once in a given period of time . See also Return period. River discharge See Streamflow. Runoff That part of precipitation that does not evaporate and is not transpired, but flows through the ground or over the ground surface and returns to bodies of water. See also Hydrological cycle. Scenario A plausible description of how the future may develop based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces  and relationships. Note that scenarios are neither predictions nor forecasts, but are useful to provide a view of the implications of developments and actions. See also Climate scenario, Emission scenario, Representative Concentration Pathways and SRES scenarios. Sea ice Ice found at the sea surface that has originated from the freezing of seawater. Sea ice may be discontinuous pieces  moved on the ocean surface by wind and currents , or a motionless sheet attached to the coast . Sea ice concentration is the fraction of the ocean covered by ice. Sea ice less than one year old is called firstyear ice. Perennial ice is sea ice that survives at least one summer. It may be subdivided into second-year ice and multi-year ice, where multiyear ice has survived at least two summers. 1461	0
Sea level change Sea level can change, both globally and locally due to  changes in the shape of the ocean basins,  a change in ocean volume as a result of a change in the mass of water in the ocean, and  changes in ocean volume as a result of changes in ocean water density. Global mean sea level change resulting from change in the mass of the ocean is called barystatic. The amount of barystatic sea level change due to the addition or removal of a mass of water is called its sea level equivalent . Sea level changes, both globally and locally, resulting from changes in water density are called steric. Density changes induced by temperature changes only are called thermosteric, while density changes induced by salinity changes are called halosteric. Barystatic and steric sea level changes do not include the effect of changes in the shape of ocean basins induced by the change in the ocean mass and its distribution. See also Relative Sea Level and Thermal expansion. Sea level equivalent  The sea level equivalent of a mass of water  is that mass, converted to a volume using a density of 1000 kg m-3, and divided by the present-day ocean surface area of 3.625 x 1014 m2. Thus, 362.5 Gt of water mass added to the ocean will cause 1 mm of global mean sea level rise. See also Sea level change. Seasonally frozen ground See Frozen ground.	0
Sea surface temperature  The sea surface temperature is the subsurface bulk temperature in the top few metres of the ocean, measured by ships, buoys and drifters. From ships, measurements of water samples in buckets were mostly switched in the 1940s to samples from engine intake water. Satellite measurements of skin temperature  in the infrared or the top centimetre or so in the microwave are also used, but must be adjusted to be compatible with the bulk temperature. Semi-direct  effect See Aerosol-radiation interaction. Semi-empirical model Model in which calculations are based on a combination of observed associations between variables and theoretical considerations relating variables through fundamental principles . For example, in sea level studies, semi-empirical models refer specifically to transfer functions formulated to project future global mean sea level change, or contributions to it, from future global mean surface temperature change or radiative forcing. Sensible heat flux The turbulent or conductive flux of heat from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere that is not associated with phase changes of water; a component of the surface energy budget. Sequestration	0
Shortwave radiation See Solar radiation. Significant wave height The average trough-to-crest height of the highest one third of the wave heights  occurring in a particular time period. Sink Any process, activity or mechanism that removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas or aerosol from the atmosphere. Slab-ocean model A simplified representation in a climate model of the ocean as a motionless layer of water with a depth of 50 to 100 m. Climate models with a slab ocean can be used only for estimating the equilibrium response of climate to a given forcing, not the transient evolution of climate. See also Equilibrium and transient climate experiment. Snow cover extent The areal extent of snow covered ground. Snow water equivalent  The depth of liquid water that would result if a mass of snow melted completely. Soil moisture 1462	0
Soil temperature The temperature of the soil. This can be measured or modelled at multiple levels within the depth of the soil. Solar activity General term describing a variety of magnetic phenomena on the Sun such as sunspots, faculae , and flares . It varies on time scales from minutes to millions of years. See also Solar cycle. Solar  cycle A quasi-regular modulation of solar activity with varying amplitude and a period of between 8 and 14 years. Solar radiation Electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Sun with a spectrum close to the one of a black body with a temperature of 5770 K. The radiation peaks in visible wavelengths. When compared to the terrestrial radiation it is often referred to as shortwave radiation. See also Insolation and Total solar irradiance . Solar Radiation Management  Solar Radiation Management refers to the intentional modification of the Earth's shortwave radiative budget with the aim to reduce climate change according to a given metric . Artificial injection of stratospheric aerosols and cloud brightening are two examples of SRM techniques. Methods to modify some fast-responding elements of the longwave radiative budget , although not strictly speaking SRM, can be related to SRM. SRM techniques do not fall within the usual definitions of mitigation and adaptation . See also Solar radiation, Carbon Dioxide Removal  and Geoengineering. Solubility pump Solubility pump is an important physicochemical process that transports dissolved inorganic carbon from the ocean's surface to its interior. This process controls the inventory of carbon in the ocean. The solubility of gaseous carbon dioxide can alter carbon dioxide concentrations in the oceans and the overlying atmosphere. See also Biological pump. Source Any process, activity or mechanism that releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas or aerosol into the atmosphere. Southern Annular Mode  The leading mode of variability of Southern Hemisphere geopotential height, which is associated with shifts in the latitude of the midlatitude jet. See SAM Index, Box 2.5. Southern Oscillation See El Nino-Southern Oscillation . South Pacific Convergence Zone  A band of low-level convergence, cloudiness and precipitation ranging from the west Pacific warm pool south-eastwards towards French Polynesia, which is one of the most significant features of subtropical Southern Hemisphere climate. It shares some characteristics with the ITCZ, but is more extratropical in nature, especially east of the Dateline. Spatial and temporal scales Climate may vary on a large range of spatial and temporal scales. Spatial scales may range from local , through regional  to continental . Temporal scales may range from seasonal to geological . Specific humidity The specific humidity specifies the ratio of the mass of water vapour to the total mass of moist air. See also Relative humidity. SRES scenarios SRES scenarios are emission scenarios developed by Nakienovi and Swart  and used, among others, as a basis for some of the climate projections shown in Chapters 9 to 11 of IPCC  and Chapters 10 and 11 of IPCC . The following terms are relevant for a better understanding of the structure and use of the set of SRES scenarios: Scenario family Scenarios that have a similar demographic, societal, economic and technical change storyline. Four scenario families comprise the SRES scenario set: A1, A2, B1 and B2.	0
Illustrative Scenario A scenario that is illustrative for each of the six scenario groups reflected in the Summary for Policymakers of Nakienovi and Swart . They include four revised marker scenarios for the scenario groups A1B, A2, B1, B2 and two additional scenarios for the A1FI and A1T groups. All scenario groups are equally sound. Marker Scenario A scenario that was originally posted in draft form on the SRES website to represent a given scenario family. The choice of markers was based on which of the initial quantifications best reflected the storyline, and the features of specific models. Markers are no more likely than other scenarios, but are considered by the SRES writing team as illustrative of a particular storyline. They are included in revised form in Nakienovi and Swart . These scenarios received the closest scrutiny of the entire writing team and via the SRES open process. Scenarios were also selected to illustrate the other two scenario groups. Storyline A narrative description of a scenario , highlighting the main scenario characteristics, relationships between key driving forces and the dynamics of their evolution. Steric See Sea level change. Stock See Reservoir. Storm surge The temporary increase, at a particular locality, in the height of the sea due to extreme meteorological conditions . The storm surge is defined as being the excess above the level expected from the tidal variation alone at that time and place. Storm tracks Originally, a term referring to the tracks of individual cyclonic weather systems, but now often generalized to refer to the main regions where the tracks of extratropical disturbances occur as sequences of low  and high  pressure systems. Stratosphere The highly stratified region of the atmosphere above the troposphere extending from about 10 km  to about 50 km altitude. Streamflow Water flow within a river channel, for example expressed in m3 s-1. A synonym for river discharge. Subduction Ocean process in which surface waters enter the ocean interior from the surface mixed layer through Ekman pumping and lateral advection. The latter occurs when surface waters are advected to a region where the local surface layer is less dense and therefore must slide below the surface layer, usually with no change in density. Sunspots Dark areas on the Sun where strong magnetic fields reduce the convection causing a temperature reduction of about 1500 K compared to the surrounding regions. The number of sunspots is higher during periods of higher solar activity, and varies in particular with the solar cycle. Surface layer See Atmospheric boundary layer. Surface temperature See Global mean surface temperature, Land surface air temperature and Sea surface temperature. Talik A layer of year-round unfrozen ground that lies in permafrost areas. Teleconnection A statistical association between climate variables at widely separated, geographically-fixed spatial locations. Teleconnections are caused by large spatial structures such as basin-wide coupled modes of ocean-atmosphere variability, Rossby wave-trains, mid-latitude jets and storm tracks, etc. See also Teleconnection pattern. Teleconnection pattern A correlation map obtained by calculating the correlation between variables at different spatial locations and a climate index. It is the special case of a climate pattern obtained for stan-	0
dardized variables and a standardized climate index, that is, the variables and index are each centred and scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. One-point teleconnection maps are made by choosing a variable at one of the locations to be the climate index. See also Teleconnection. Terrestrial radiation Radiation emitted by the Earth's surface, the atmosphere and the clouds. It is also known as thermal infrared or longwave radiation, and is to be distinguished from the near-infrared radiation that is part of the solar spectrum. Infrared radiation, in general, has a distinctive range of wavelengths  longer than the wavelength of the red light in the visible part of the spectrum. The spectrum of terrestrial radiation is almost entirely distinct from that of shortwave or solar radiation because of the difference in temperature between the Sun and the Earth-atmosphere system. See also Outgoing longwave radiation. Thermal expansion In connection with sea level, this refers to the increase in volume  that results from warming water. A warming of the ocean leads to an expansion of the ocean volume and hence an increase in sea level. See also Sea level change. Thermocline The layer of maximum vertical temperature gradient in the ocean, lying between the surface ocean and the abyssal ocean. In subtropical regions, its source waters are typically surface waters at higher latitudes that have subducted  and moved equatorward. At high latitudes, it is sometimes absent, replaced by a halocline, which is a layer of maximum vertical salinity gradient. Thermohaline circulation  Large-scale circulation in the ocean that transforms low-density upper ocean waters to higher-density intermediate and deep waters and returns those waters back to the upper ocean. The circulation is asymmetric, with conversion to dense waters in restricted regions at high latitudes and the return to the surface involving slow upwelling and diffusive processes over much larger geographic regions. The THC is driven by high densities at or near the surface, caused by cold temperatures and/or high salinities, but despite its suggestive though common name, is also driven by mechanical forces such as wind and tides. Frequently, the name THC has been used synonymously with Meridional Overturning Circulation. Thermokarst The process by which characteristic landforms result from the thawing of ice-rich permafrost or the melting of massive ground ice. Thermosteric See Sea level change. Tide gauge A device at a coastal or deep-sea location that continuously measures the level of the sea with respect to the adjacent land. Time averaging of the sea level so recorded gives the observed secular changes of the relative sea level. Tipping point In climate, a hypothesized critical threshold when global or regional climate changes from one stable state to another stable state. The tipping point event may be irreversible. See also Irreversibility. Total solar irradiance  The total amount of solar radiation in watts per square metre received outside the Earth's atmosphere on a surface normal to the incident radiation, and at the Earth's mean distance from the Sun. Reliable measurements of solar radiation can only be made from space and the precise record extends back only to 1978. The generally accepted value is 1368 W m-2 with an accuracy of about 0.2%. It has recently been estimated to 1360.8  0.5 W m-2 for the solar minimum of 2008. Variations of a few tenths of a percent are common, usually associated with the passage of sunspots across the solar disk. The solar cycle variation of TSI is of the order of 0.1% . Changes in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum during a solar cycle are comparatively larger  than in TSI. See also Insolation. 1463	0
Transient climate response See Climate sensitivity. Transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions  The transient global average surface temperature change per unit cumulated CO2 emissions, usually 1000 PgC. TCRE combines both information on the airborne fraction of cumulated CO2 emissions , and on the transient climate response . Tree rings Concentric rings of secondary wood evident in a cross section of the stem of a woody plant. The difference between the dense, smallcelled late wood of one season and the wide-celled early wood of the following spring enables the age of a tree to be estimated, and the ring widths or density can be related to climate parameters such as temperature and precipitation. See also Proxy. Trend In this report, the word trend designates a change, generally monotonic in time, in the value of a variable. Tropopause The boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere. Troposphere The lowest part of the atmosphere, from the surface to about 10 km in altitude at mid-latitudes , where clouds and weather phenomena occur. In the troposphere, temperatures generally decrease with height. See also Stratosphere. AIII	0
Turnover time See Lifetime. Uncertainty A state of incomplete knowledge that can result from a lack of information or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. It may have many types of sources, from imprecision in the data to ambiguously defined concepts or terminology, or uncertain projections of human behaviour. Uncertainty can therefore be represented by quantitative measures  or by qualitative statements  . See also Confidence and Likelihood. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  The Convention was adopted on 9 May 1992 in New York and signed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro by more than 150 countries and the European Community. Its ultimate objective is the `stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system'. It contains commitments for all Parties. Under the Convention, Parties included in Annex I  aim to return greenhouse gas emissions not controlled by the Montreal Protocol to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The convention entered in force in March 1994. In 1997, the UNFCCC adopted the Kyoto Protocol. Uptake The addition of a substance of concern to a reservoir. The uptake of carbon containing substances, in particular carbon dioxide, is often called  sequestration. Urban heat island  The relative warmth of a city compared with surrounding rural areas, associated with changes in runoff, effects on heat retention, and changes in surface albedo. Ventilation The exchange of ocean properties with the atmospheric surface layer such that property concentrations are brought closer to equilibrium values with the atmosphere , and the processes that propagate these properties into the ocean interior.	0
Volatile Organic Compounds  Important class of organic chemical air pollutants that are volatile at ambient air conditions. Other terms used to represent VOCs are hydrocarbons , reactive organic gases  and non-methane volatile organic compounds . NMVOCs are major contributors  to the formation of photochemical oxidants such as ozone. Walker Circulation Direct thermally driven zonal overturning circulation in the atmosphere over the tropical Pacific Ocean, with rising air in the western and sinking air in the eastern Pacific. Warm days/warm nights Days where maximum temperature, or nights where minimum temperature, exceeds the 90th percentile, where the respective temperature distributions are generally defined with respect to the 1961-1990 reference period. For the corresponding indices, see Box 2.4. Warm spell A period of abnormally hot weather. For the corresponding indices, see Box 2.4. See also Heat wave. Water cycle See Hydrological cycle. Water mass A body of ocean water with identifiable properties  resulting from its unique formation process. Water masses are often identified through a vertical or horizontal extremum of a property such as salinity. North Pacific Intermediate Water  and Antarctic Intermediate Water  are examples of water masses. Weathering The gradual removal of atmospheric CO2 through dissolution of silicate and carbonate rocks. Weathering may involve physical processes  or chemical activity . Well-mixed greenhouse gas See Greenhouse gas. Younger Dryas A period 12.85 to 11.65 ka , during the deglaciation, characterized by a temporary return to colder conditions in many locations, especially around the North Atlantic.	0
