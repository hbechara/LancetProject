Appendix 2 - Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability
A number of challenges associated with choosing indicators to track the health impacts of climate
change are recognised, specifically: dealing with signal-to-noise ratios; attribution to climate change;
and the role of institutions and policies in determining the impact of a climate hazard on labour
productivity, food security, nutrition, and migration. Signal-to-noise ratios are of particular concern
here for two reasons. First, with respect to climate warming and climate hazards, annual natural
climate variability introduces noise into the system, whereas an important signal is the long-term
climate trend.17 Attribution, "the process of establishing the most likely causes for a detected
change with some level of confidence"18, thus becomes important when selecting indicators.
Second, with respect to identifying the impact of a climate hazard on human wellbeing and health,
as reflected in disease, nutrition, and migration, the ultimate impacts on health are heavily mediated
by institutions and policies, such that the signal-to-noise ratio between climate hazard and health
impact decreases.

Methods

1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability
1.1. 1.1 Health effects of temperature change
Firstly, temperature change relative to 1986-2008 mean was calculated for 2000-2016.
The summer months for each hemisphere were selected (June-July-August for
northern hemisphere, December, January, February for southern). Maps of
temperature change were plotted and an area-weighted mean was calculated for the
temperature change grid. The area weighting was calculated by multiplying the value
for each grid location by the cosine of the location latitude, to account for the
projection of the rectangular grid onto the spherical globe.
Area-weighting is the normal way to define global warming, and is relevant to the 2oC
and 1.5oC limits discussed in the Paris Agreement (note however that Figure 1.1 shows
changes relative to 1986-2008 rather than relative to pre-industrial). The concept of
weighting by exposure was introduced in the 2015 Lancet Commission report, to better
represent the exposure of vulnerable parts of the population to changes in mean
climate and in climate extremes.4 Exposure-weighting can be seen as a mean of
`vulnerable heads', while area-weighting is a mean over areas of the Earth's surface.
Secondly, temperature changes were projected onto a world population grid and the
population-weighted mean for each year was calculated to produce a time series.
Note that since the weighting for each year was performed using the population for
that year, this cancels out population growth effects. This is true for indicators 1.1-1.3.

Data

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) provided
weather data for this indicator. ERA-Interim climate reanalysis data was used, as well
as a 1986-2008 climatology derived from ERA.
(https://www.ecmwf.int/en/research/climate-reanalysis/era-interim)
Population gridded data was obtained from the NASA Gridded Population of the World
(GPW) v4 using UN-adjusted population grid data
(http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4) at 5-year intervals from
2000-2020, with yearly population interpolated from these values. 2005 was used as a
mid-point for the time series.

1.2. Health effects of heatwaves
A heatwave was defined as a period of 4 or more days at a given
location where the minimum daily temperature was greater than
the 99th percentile of the distribution of minimum daily
temperature at that location over the 1986-2008 reference period,
for the summer months.
The number and length of heatwaves was calculated for 1986-2016
over the weather grid. The mean number and length was calculated
for 1986-2008. The summer months for each hemisphere were
selected as in 1.1. The change in number and length of heatwaves
was then calculated for each year from 2000 to 2016 for each
location and the global area weighted means calculated for each
year.
Yearly population grids were used as described in 1.1
The population over 65 count was calculated by matching
demographic data the fraction of people over 65 for each year from
the UN WPP with country area definitions, and projecting this onto
the population grid. This effectively assumed that over 65 fraction is
constant across a given country's area.
The number and length of heatwaves grid was projected onto the
population over 65. A population weighted mean length was
calculated and a number of exposures (heatwaves x persons) were
calculated for each year.

1.3. Labour productivity loss
The labour capacity was defined as
labour capacity=100-25max(0, WBGT-25)2/3
where WBGT is the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature, which is a
16

function of the dew point temperature (see Dunne et al. 2013).
WBGT and labour capacity were calculated for 1986-2016. The
difference for each year between labour capacity and the mean
labour capacity for 1986-2008 was then calculated.
Yearly population grids were used as described in 1.1
Using a method similar to 1.2, the fraction of the population living
in rural areas from WPP was associated with each country and
projected onto the population grid. This was used to calculate the
population weighted change in labour capacity for each year to
produce the labour capacity time series.

1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability
1.4. Lethality of weather-related disasters
This indicator is based on the generic formulation from a climate change
perspective of disasters as a function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability.
Year to year variation was measured, showing the number of people killed as a
proportion of those affected by different hazard type, normalised by the
strength of the individual hazards as a measure of adaptive (or maladaptive)
changes in national health care services and the associated disaster
preparedness and response.
Here, deaths are defined as the number of people who lost their life because
the disaster happened, and people affected as those requiring immediate
assistance during a period of emergency; hence requiring basic survival needs
such as food, water, shelter, sanitation and immediate medical assistance.
EM-DAT at the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) at
the Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium (http://www.emdat.be/).
One underlying assumption is that the normalised number of people killed by
climate related disasters is an accurate proxy for measuring health impacts of
the climate. Clearly this measure ignores the longer causal chains involving the
interaction of climate and health.
Finally, a further limitation is that this measure ignores the longer causal chains
involving the interactions of weather, climate, disasters, health and health
services.
To date, there is no international consensus regarding best practices for
collecting disaster impact data. However, EM-DAT represents one of the most
17

widely used datasets in this area and is used here for a number of reasons: it is
updated on a daily basis; includes information from over 21,000 disasters since
1900; the data entries are reviewed and validated for completeness and
consistency; and the data comes from a wide range of sources including UN
organisations, local NGOs, insurance companies, research institutes and
media/press. The validity of the deaths-to-affected ratio as an indicator rests
on the assumption that it reflects disaster management and health system
capacity. A key challenge for this indicator is in estimating those affected and
those exposed, and distinguishing the two; a difficult task in the context of
disasters. An important caveat is that while the number of people affected in a
disaster is often reported, the operational definition of who is "affected" varies
across countries, as do the methods of estimation. Additionally, some of the
most severe droughts are related to water management issues, not to weather,
and yet the cause of the drought is not differentiated here. Similarly, the cause
of landslides is often difficult to determine, and so these events are not
included in the data here.
Future Form of
Indicator

Future efforts will include a comparison of estimates of those exposed with
those affected. Additionally, the impact of replacing the number of people
killed with the number requiring assistance will also be explored.
A subsidiary indicator will come from the online Sendai Framework Monitor.
Here countries will start reporting against the Sendai Framework indicators and
the DRR related indicators of the SDGs. The first Sendai Framework and SDG
progress report will be released in 2019 1. This indicator therefore aims to
expand to include country specific progress in vulnerability levels of health
service systems to climate risks in relation to this monitoring data.

1.5 Global health trends in climate-sensitive diseases
This indicator displays generally unprocessed descriptive trends for
selected diseases retrieved from The Global Burden of Disease (GBD)
project database (1) over the period 1990-2015. The derivation of
estimates within the GBD study relies on modelling, rather than
analysing direct observations, and the GBD methodology has already
been described (1). The trends are aggregated and presented by
WHO region as mortality rates per 100,000 individuals per year over
the period. We provide also annual estimates by country in the
supplement. As far as we can ascertain from the GBD documentation,
climate change and weather are not part of the covariates included in
the estimates, making it valid to examine GBD outputs in the light of
climate and weather data to formulate coherent inter-country
comparisons. Trends are described for: all causes of death, malaria,
dengue, diarrhoeal diseases, protein-energy malnutrition, heat and
cold exposure, malignant melanoma and forces of nature.
Deaths directly related to forces of nature have been adjusted for the
effects of the most severe seismic events. Of the ten highest countryyear mortality estimates due to forces of nature, seven were directly
due to specific seismic activity, and these have been discounted by
replacing with the same countries' force of nature mortality for the
following year.

This is not a direct measure of the impact of climate change on death
and disease. Rather, it presents mortality figures for those diseases
which are none to be influenced by climate. The trends presented
therefore do not show detection and attribution of climate change to
death. They do show the impact of climate relevant and climate
sensitive diseases on mortality rates globally since 1990.
GBD estimates are now revised annually. Future versions of this
indicator may include additional health conditions, may include
morbidity as well as mortality, and may extend to national and
subnational scales. Increased interest in geo-spatial disease analyses
is likely to lead to additional information, such as fringe zone trends
and outbreaks, and associate patterns of diseases to climate
anomalies, such as those driven by the ENSO circulation. Future
disease trends in the GBD estimates will be linked to direct
measurements in resource poor areas in Africa and Asia, for example
using longitudinal mortality registers from the INDEPTH network.15

1.6 Climate-sensitive infectious diseases
Methods for the analysis on publication on climate-sensitive infectious diseases
follow Liang and Gong (2017), updated to the most recent complete year for which
data were available (2016). Briefly, we conducted a systematic review of the
literature using bibliographic databases including the ISI Web of Science, Scopus,
ScienceDirect, and PubMed. We used a multi-step approach, first searching
abstract/title/keywords using strings of [(`climate change' or `climate') and
`infectious disease'], followed by retention of articles focussing on disease in
humans, then a second round of searching using further keywords describing more
specific climate-disease elements, and finally a manual screen according to specific
rules (namely, we removed duplicated, non-English, non-peer reviewed, nonhuman related articles and those that did not report a health outcome related to
climate change, such as review, editorial, or commentary articles). Essential article
information was extracted from each paper for the summary, including: 1) direct
information including the title, journal, publishing year, authors; 2) place name and
spatial scale of the study area; 3) study period; 4) research methods used; 5) types
of infectious disease studied; 6) types of climatic variable studied; and 7) the
conclusions made about the impacts of climate change on human infectious
disease. The final dataset included 339 papers.
Methods for calculating Vectorial Capacity (VC) follow Liu-Helmersson et al. (2016)
and Liu-Helmersson et al. (2014). VC refers to a vector's ability to transmit disease
to humans. It incorporates interactions between host, virus, and vector, assuming
that all three of these elements are present. Specifically, VC represents the
average daily number of secondary cases generated by one primary case
introduced into a fully susceptible population, and is expressed as:

Where a is the average vector biting rate, bh is the probability of vector to human
transmission per bite, bm is the probability of human to vector infection per bite, n
is the duration of the extrinsic incubation period - EIP, m is the vector mortality
rate, and m is the female vector-to-human population ratio. In our application, the
time unit is one day and each of the vector parameters depends on temperature,
with parameter values derived from the literature, typically from experimental
data, as described in Liu-Helmersson et al., (2014). Diurnal temperature range
(DTR) was reconstructed using a representative daily temperature through a piecewise sinusoidal function based on the monthly average of daily minimum,
maximum, and mean observations. We extracted the annual average VC values per
grid cell to Aedes aegypti presence points provided in Kraemer et al., (2015) and
averaged these values by country to get country specific trends in VC at a yearly
time step from 1950-2015.
Climate data were taken from the Climate Research Unit Time Series (CRU-TS 3.22)
online database of gridded (0.5 x 0.5 degrees) monthly averages of daily
temperature observations (minimums, maximum, and mean) for the period
January 1, 1950 to December 31, 2015 (the latest year available).
Key caveats and limitations of the model and its parameterisation are described in
Liu-Helmersson et al., (2014, 2016).
It is difficult to extrapolate the trend in publication effort and trends to 2030 given
the very recent near exponential increase in publications meeting the systematic
search criteria and the dynamic nature of representativeness of both disease types
and geographical spread through time. However, in the near term, we can expect
an ongoing increase in the volume of publications exploring climate change -
infectious disease associations, covering increasingly more dynamic and complex
disease systems with increasing taxonomic and geographic representativeness. We
might expect an ongoing decline or flattening off in the proportion of publications
reporting positive associations (i.e., increases in risk) as more and increasingly
complex systems are addressed more robustly with increasing potential to address
confounding and interacting factors. Climate change is not expected to be a
universal driver of increasing disease risk and many disease systems may exhibit
overall declines in risk as changes in climatic factors could similarly drive
components of disease transmission systems beyond environmental optima
(Lafferty and Mordecai, 2016). Understanding this broader range of responses is
critical to tailor research and management efforts on disease systems and
populations.
There has been a clear and consistent increase in globally averaged VC since the
late 1970s. For Aedes aegypti, VC was an average of 9.4% higher in 2015 relative to
a 1950 baseline. Extrapolating the strong linear increase in VC for Aedes aegypti
since 1950 (R2 = 0.784) suggests that VC could increase by a further 1.6% by 2030
(i.e., ~11% overall increase relative to the 1950 baseline). This extrapolation is
based only on the observed increase in VC to date and does not take into account
actual projections of climate change from global circulation models.

1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability
1.7. Food security and undernutrition
1.7.1. Vulnerability to undernutrition
In an increasingly connected world, food security is equally a globalised concern.
The link between agricultural production, health and nutrition, and climate is
complex. Thus identifying a single climate and under-nutrition indicator to track,
requires compromises and an understanding that only certain aspects of this
relationship can be addressed. This methods section explores the logic and
rationale behind the specific indicator selected to track climate, food insecurity,
and health. In doing so, a number of additional potential indicators are discussed,
to contextualise the chosen indicator.
First a rapid review of the literature was undertaken to explore indicators of food
security, under-nutrition, and climate, and the pathways under which climate
change affects under-nutrition. This creates the narrative behind the chosen
indicator and its evolution, and is used to identify the critical parameters that need
to be taken account of when choosing how to construct the indicator. Second,
informed by this review, relevant country-level data were collected that address
food production-related vulnerability and exposure to global warming. Third, an
indicator was constructed. Fourth, looking forward, a more nuanced indicator is
considered that will build on real time data that incorporates temperature in
addition to vulnerability and exposure.
Whilst the indicator explored here focuses on climate and under-nutrition, it is
recognised that food insecurity has long been closely linked to poverty (for
example, Reutlinger, 1985; Maxwell, 1996), whether low yields for farmers, low
purchasing power for consumers, or a high proportion of income spent on food.
23

Thus, irrespective of climate, there are many approaches to enhancing food
security and nutrition.
Literature and narrative
Food security has been defined by the FAO as "a situation that exists when all
people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe
and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an
active and healthy life" (FAO. 2002. The State of Food Insecurity in the World
2001. Rome). Thus food security requires there to be enough food, in the right
place, and for people to be able afford to purchase it. If an individual is not food
secure, implicitly they are at risk of under-nourishment and ill-health. Most of the
world's food insecure are located in African countries by proportion (27% undernourished) and South Asian countries by absolute numbers (300m undernourished) (www.fao.org).
At a global level, total food availability in any one year depends on stocks and
current year harvest. Governments and individuals hold grain reserves. Whereas
public storage has stabilising impact on food price volatility and therefore a
positive impact on food security, grain held by private sector corporations tends to
be for speculation (d'Amour, 2016) and thus plays a much smaller role with
respect to food security. Carry-over stocks of grain have been described by Lester
Brown, president of the Earth Policy Institute, as the most basic indicator of food
security. Thus the number of days' worth of grain held in storage can be
considered to provide one real time indicator of global food security. Globally,
over the past three decades, stocks have been falling, due variously to
liberalization of grain markets, the high costs of storage, and governments being
increasingly willing to rely on markets rather than storage in times of localized
shortages (Figure 1). Whilst this could suggest a reduction in global food security,
the accompanying increased trade in grains can substitute for storage, mitigating
the impacts of idiosyncratic food production stocks across space, whereas storage
mitigates across time.

reserves would feed the global population (source: Compiled by Earth Policy
Institute from United States Department of Agriculture, Production, Supply &
Distribution)
Lower-income countries are vulnerable to climate change, whether they highly
dependent on grain imports, or on domestic production, but in different ways. The
food system is increasingly globalised, and countries that are highly dependent on
food imports are particularly vulnerable to non-localised agricultural productivity
shocks that originate in other countries and are propagated through international
food markets (Ahmed et al., 2009; d'Amour et al., 2016), suggesting that increased
trade may not be able to fully substitute for reduced food stocks. This was clearly
demonstrated in the 2008 food crisis. Droughts in Australia affecting the wheat
harvest triggered speculation, hording, and several countries introducing export
restrictions, which all combined to drive up the price of staples and increase food
insecurity (Headey and Fan, 2008), resulting in an extreme spike in the price of
rice, and even triggering food riots in Haiti. Indeed, "cereals imports dependency
ratio" is a key FAO food security indicator, reflecting the importance of the global
food system to individual country food security. Such systemic crises, in which
shocks that originate in one country affecting one specific crop trigger instability
and crisis in other countries, crops, or sectors, occur with low probability but have
a high impact on food security and under-nutrition. They are not the focus here, in
part because the pathway from initial climate hazard in one location to
undernutrition in another is complex, tricky to predict, and highly mediated by
human systems, thus diluting the climate signal considerably.
In part in reaction to the 2008 food crisis, countries may increase their efforts to
be food self-sufficient. Yet perhaps paradoxically, some countries that increase
their dependence on domestic production rather than imports (i.e. an emphasis
on food security through self-sufficiency rather than increased ability to purchase
25

imported foods) will remain vulnerable to climate change, though under different
conditions. This is particularly so for countries located in latitudes where greater
temperature increases are predicted, and where yields of key staples have been
found to be particularly sensitive to temperature increases. Greater variability in
climate in regions where there are already high levels of under-nourishment has
been recognized as a consequence of global warming and a key issue for undernourishment (Schmidhuber and Tubiello, 2007) due to instability in food
production (Bruinsma, 2003). Disentangling the impact of climate can be tricky as
farming practices and technologies are also changing over time.
Candidates for indicator selection
Given the complex links between climate, food production, food security and
under-nutrition, several options for a suitable indicator were considered. For each
of these potential options commonalities exist. The first is a focus on countries and
regions where there are already high levels of under-nutrition, thus their
populations are particularly vulnerable to negative food shocks. The second is a
focus on those countries that are most reliant on domestic production, and thus
most likely to be directly harmed by location-specific climate hazards. Though
yields will be affected differentially depending on the particular crop and location,
there is clear evidence from global studies covering over 20 years of research, that
crop yields are more negatively affected across most tropical areas than at higher
latitudes, and typically countries with a current high hunger levels will experience
the highest yield declines due to climate change (Wheeler and von Braun, 2013).
The third focus is on locations where climate change is predicted to have a
particularly negative impact on yields. The IPCC reports with medium to high
confidence that increasing global temperatures will have an overall negative
impact on key staple yields, particularly for wheat and maize, whilst the impacts
on rice and soybean are smaller. The impacts are not evenly spread across the
globe. Higher latitude countries typically are currently benefiting from increasing
temperatures, with yields in some more temperate countries predicted to increase
in response to climate change. At lower temperature increases, positive feedbacks
have been identified for spring wheat and soybean, which have been predicted to
improve globally due to CO2 fertilisation effects. Increasing CO2 concentrations
enhance water use efficiency and yields but can be accompanied by elevated
levels of O3 that can harm yields. Overall, increases in temperature up to 3
degrees Celsius may enhance average global crop yields (Deryng et al., 2014).
Thus globally, shifts north and CO2 fertilisation may increase food security in
higher latitudes, and mitigate against loss of yield elsewhere at the level of the
global food system.
Given the decision to focus on countries that are currently experiencing high levels
of under-nutrition, that are particularly dependent on domestic production of
staple foods, and that are in locations where global warming will have a negative
impact on yields, several potential indicators were considered that link to
temperature, drought, and vulnerability.
Temperature, climate, and under-nutrition
26

Overall crop yields for staples (excluding rice for which no overall change is
predicted) are predicted to decline on average by 8% by the 2050s in South Asia (16% maize, -11% sorghum) and Africa (-17% wheat, -5% maize, -15% sorghum, 10% millet), currently the most food insecure regions (Wheeler and von Braun,
2013), as a result of increasing temperatures. Recognising the well documented
linkages between temperature and yield loss, one option considered was to
monitor temperature. Such a temperature-oriented indicator would provide a
strong climate signal, but weaker food availability and nutrition signal; is highly
data intensive, with the required data being time, location, and crop and variety
specific; and with important interactions between temperature and precipitation
(Jones and Thornton, 2003). For example, the effects of extreme temperature or
precipitation events within any particular growing season can have
disproportionately large impacts on final yields. Daytime warming has been found
particularly harmful to maize in African countries whereas night time warming is
particularly harmful for rice (Lobell et al., 2011).
Drought, climate, and under-nutrition
The second option considered was to monitor the number of households affected
by droughts, particularly those in countries already experiencing under-nutrition.
Climatic hazards, in the form of droughts, and to a lesser extent floods, have been
identified as causing localised and relatively sudden onset of extreme food
insecurity (Devereux, 2007) and accompanying health problems in vulnerable
communities that are highly dependent on agriculture. Such climate hazards are
predicted to increase as a consequence of global warming (Easterling et al., 2000),
and are particularly tricky to adapt to in the shorter and longer term. One of the
most comprehensive databases of negative harvest shocks caused by drought can
be found on reliefweb.org. Reliefweb tracks "disasters" that can be categorized
using various search terms. Searching for "drought" within the database allows
one to count the number of "drought" events that have resulted in a sufficiently
severe localised weather-induced harvest failure to cause significant increases in
hunger in the country where the drought occurred. For example, in 2016, Sri Lanka
drought led to the loss of two consecutive harvest losses that resulted in 900,000
people being severely food insecure and requiring immediate support to mitigate
the impact (Reliefweb.org). However, isolating the climate warming signal from
cyclical processes such as El Nino events, given the relatively short time series for
which data are available, is not possible and so this option is not pursued.
Yield, climate, and under-nutrition
There is considerable evidence that climate change will have a negative impact on
yields in lower latitudes, suggesting the possibility of an indicator that links to
realised yields in countries already experiencing high levels of under-nutrition.
Average yield data can be obtained from FAOSTAT for the key staple grains for
each country, and divergences from regional and global trends calculated.
However, even measuring yield differentials rather than absolute yields, given the
myriad of adaptation opportunities in the short to medium term that can be
adopted to prevent yields from falling, the climate-yield reduction signal is
27

weakened and thus too the climate health signal. Thus this option is therefore not
pursued.
Vulnerability, climate, and under-nutrition
The fourth option is to focus on vulnerability and exposure of populations in
locations where the literature is confident that temperature increases will affect
yields negatively. Two key dimensions are considered: reliance on domestic
production in lower-latitude countries most likely to be affected negatively by
climate change; and existing prevalence of under-nourishment. Countries with low
cereal import dependence ratios (high domestic production dependence) are
countries most vulnerable to localised weather shocks. This is the option that is
followed, and detailed in the section below, though it is recognized that as
presented, the climate-health signal remains weak. The indicator currently
combines data on vulnerability, as proxied by current levels of under-nutrition,
with exposure, as proxied by dependence of the population on locally produced
climate-sensitive crops.
Data
The FAO dataset reveals 5 countries with "very high" (>35%) levels of undernourishment; 15 countries with "high" (>25%) levels; and 18 countries with
"moderately high" (>15%) levels (http://www.fao.org/hunger/en/). Details are
provided in Table 1 for current under-nourishment prevalence. These countries
were then categorised according to the extent to which they are dependent on
domestic production, the key cause of their levels of under-nourishment, and their
vulnerability to climate-related falls in yield, based on location. At a more
aggregated level, five regions with under-nourishment prevalence rates of over
15% stand out. These are Southern Africa (excluding South Africa), Middle Africa,
Eastern Africa, Southern Asia, and Western Africa.
Regional details
Countries in southern Africa are highly dependent on food production in the
region. Therefore, though individually some countries have a low "domestic
production" indicator (for example, Swaziland, 26.8%), the regional "domestic
production" indictor is 91%, implying that the region only imports 9% of its food
requirements. Thus any localised drought or general fall in production affects the
region broadly, though these countries are less vulnerable to the low-probability
high-impact systemic crises precipitated by harvest shocks in different parts of the
globe. Reflecting the risk of high dependence on local food production, in 2003,
14.5 million people were reported to be at risk of starving in Malawi,
Mozambique, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe, precipitated by a twoyear drought in the region. Compounding this high dependence on domestic
production is a high dependence on individual crops. For example, Zambia has an
88% maize dependency, and Mozambique 64%. Crop simulations moreover
suggest maize yields in this region are highly sensitive to climate change. South
African maize yields are predicted to fall between -8%, -25%, and -42% for high,
medium, and low-productivity outcomes; with equivalent numbers for Malawi,
Mozambique, and Zambia of 2%, -10%, and -22% (Hertel et al., 2010; Schlenker
28

and Lovell, 2010).
Given these data, southern Africa is a key region to monitor exposure and
vulnerability as reflected in current undernutrition and reliance on domestic
production. Figure 1 demonstrates clearly that countries in southern Africa remain
persistently food insecure, and vulnerable to localised climate hazards.

Caveats
The chosen indicator focuses on the extent to which populations already
experiencing moderate to high levels of under-nutrition are vulnerable to localized
climate shocks that will compromise their health further. At present, the climate
hazard itself has not been incorporated directly, though it is indirectly
acknowledged through the choice of locations where climate change is predicted,
with confidence, to have a large and negative impact on yields, and where
populations are highly dependent on local production.
Ultimately this indicator will aim to combine critical temperatures that are known
to reduce maize yields in lower latitudes, with vulnerability as measured by
existing levels of under-nutrition, and local exposure as manifested in regional
dependence on maize. The data will be initially collected for the particular case of
southern Africa. This exercise will be repeated for the other key regions, and the
total population-vulnerability-exposure-weighted indicator presented.
The next iteration aims to produce the full suite of indicators addressed above.
Our selection of indicator is designed to address food insecurity in the context of
the direct impact of climate change on crop production. We do however recognise
that this is one element of food security and under-nutrition, and that poverty and
30

conflict have been found to be the key drivers of hunger (Misselhorn, 2005;
Margulis, 2013).

Methods

Given the importance of temperature, the aim is to incorporate temperature into
the indicator from next year, with the focus on lower-latitude areas which are
highly dependent on maize. This approach will be piloted using data for southern
Africa, for which maize is the dominant staple, the region is highly dependent on
local production, and climate change is predicted to result in high crop losses. Key
climate-oriented parameters for yield include heat stress at anthesis, and
accumulated thermal time over the growing season. For example, in African
countries, each degree day spent above 30 C during the growing season has been
shown to reduce final yield by 1% under optimal rain-fed conditions, and by
1.7% under drought conditions (Lobell et al., 2011). These findings emphasise the
importance also of precipitation. For example, water deficits during the two
critical days of tasselling or pollination have been found to result in yield losses of
up to 22% (Hall et al., 1971). Exactly which temperatures should be tracked, and
where, will be addressed in detail during the following year.

1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability
1.7. Vulnerability of food systems and under-nutrition
1.7.2. Marine primary productivity
Eleven marine fishery locations which are important in terms of projected impacts and
vulnerabilities associated with climate change were selected as determined by FAO (10)
(Fig. S1). Moreover, since a mini case study on the impact of changing marine primary
productivity on commercial fish catch and human health in the Persian Gulf is
presented herein, therefore, Persian Gulf (i.e., location 12) was also included among
the locations under investigation. February and August, representing cold and warm
periods, were considered for data acquisition. The databanks used for extracting the
data related to the A-biotic and Biotic indexes are tabulated in Table S1.

Caveats

As presented in Table S1, there exist some spatial and temporal limitations. More
specifically, some of the databases do not present a clear data trend while some other
databases only include recently-collected data and there is a lack of log-term data
required to interpret the variations in some index groups.
Future
It would be ideal to observe and monitor the A-biotic index group defined under the
Form of
Marine Primary Productivity for a period of 3-5 years at the locations of important
Indicator
fishing sites and sensitive marine costal ecosystems especially coral reefs (Fig. S1).
These could be found in the databases introduced herein (Table S1). Simultaneously,
Biotic index group parameters including density and abundance of important
commercial fish stocks (i.e., biomass of commercial fish stocks) and their respective
ichthyoplankton community shall also be assessed during the same time period and at
the same locations. It is also suggested to investigate the diversity and density of
phytoplankton community at the same locations and over similar time frame too. Such
findings could assist in assessing the human health-related unfavourable consequences
of climate change through jeopardizing marine primary production or in another word,
marine-based food security and nutrition. Moreover, the resultant implications could
serve as guidelines for the policy makers and the authorities of the marine environment
departments to strive to engage NGOs and local communities to contribute to
conservation, management, and sustainable utilization of the marine resources and
ecosystems. Finally, in locations where commercial fish catch has been negatively
affected leading to decreased fish consumption, necessary measures should be taken in
order to induce public awareness regarding the associated negative health impacts
while trying to change the pattern of consumption in favour of other available marine
products.

have deteriorated between 2009 and 2016 (12), and the occurrence of Alert 2 has
significantly increased. For instance, in February 2016, the incidence of Alert 1 in the
Great Barrier Reef compared with February 2009 confirms the severity of its bleaching
status (Figure S3).

values that are at least 1oC. A DHW value of one is equivalent to one week of HotSpot
at 1oC and a DHW of two is equivalent to two weeks of HotSpot at 1oC or one week of
HotSpot at 2oC. The Bleaching HotSpot is a special type of SST anomaly showing the
difference between the nighttime SST and the maximum monthly mean (MMM) SST
climatology. The HotSpot data contain only the positive values for identifying potential
thermal stress conducive to coral bleaching."

Food Security and Fish Stocks in the Persian Gulf
One basin in which fish stocks are an important source of food is the Persian Gulf. Fish
stocks have been declining in the Persian Gulf since the 1970s, with food security
concerns arising for the populations here dependent on fish for food.86 Human
activities, including industrial activity (including petroleum production that exacerbates
climate change when later burned), dredging and land reclamation are influencing fish
stocks here.87 Furthermore, recent studies of fishing show that actual fish catch
quantities in this region are up to six times higher than the reported quantities given to
the UN, and therefore likely to be at unsustainable levels.88 These factors are
compounding to increase the pressure on fish stocks and reduce marine populations,
which many people in the area are dependent on as a primary source of food.
For fish populations already under pressure from human activities, climate change
36

presents a further challenge to fish stocks in this region by altering the ecosystems in
which they live. Thus, the ability of fish populations to withstand and recover from
direct human impacts is compromised and threatens the future maintenance and even
survival of fish populations in the Persian Gulf. This in turn has implications for human
health. Food security in the southern Persian Gulf is already a concern and fish
consumption is an important source of protein, accounting for up to 10% of the
population's protein consumption. Although innovations in aquaculture have helped
address some food security concerns inland, marine fish populations are still declining
and so food insecurity is still problematic for coastal communities in the Persian Gulf.89
Considering existing declines in marine fish populations and food security concerns in
the Persian Gulf, it is important to understand the implications of climate change in this
region, for these current risks could be further exacerbated by ecosystem changes
associated with a changing climate. Changes to SST and SSS, key proxies for measuring
the influence of climate change on fish stocks, have been found to have been
negatively impacting the coral reefs in the Persian Gulf, which fish populations are
dependent upon for their survival; for example, there were mass coral bleaching events
in the Persian Gulf in 1996 and 1998, which caused a decline in fish.87 SST has risen
since 2013, but also exceeded the coral bleaching threshold of 33C in the summer
months across both regions throughout the period 2013 to 2017 (see Appendix 2 Figure
S4).90 Rising SST and associated coral stress is likely to have contributed to lower fish
populations and associated decreases in the total catch of major commercial fish
species in the Iranian waters in the Persian Gulf, including tiger tooth croaker (Otolithes
ruber), threadfin (Polynemus spp.), and silver pomfret (Pampus argenteus).
Bushehr Province, the main Iranian fish catching site, has experienced a decrease in the
total catch of the major commercial fish species, leading to a sharp decline in annual
fish consumption per capita, from 46.8 kg in 2009 to 24.7 kg in 2016 (see Appendix 2
Figure S5).91 This decline is most likely a combination of human stressores, including
climate change and overfishing, but nonetheless the consequences for human health
are clear - reduced fish stocks increases food insecurity and risks undernutrition in the
region, as protein from fish becomes increasingly unavailable.

Group

Methods

1. Climate Change Impacts, Exposures and Vulnerability
1.8. Migration and population displacement
The presumed link between climate change and migration is now firmly embedded in
academic and public consciences. Yet critical voices continue to highlight both the lack
of evidence linking climate change directly to migration through linear causality and
the multitude of factors which influence any connections between the two. These
criticisms do not deny interactions between climate change and migration, nor the
possibility of future occurrences of large-scale migration linked to climate change. They
simply point out the truisms from migration research which are often bypassed that:
1. Migration is and always has been part of humanity.
2. Many factors, including climate-related, influence and have always influenced
human migration and non-migration decisions.
3. Where people are forced to migrate or not to migrate when they would prefer
otherwise, in many circumstances, it is lack of support mechanisms to deal with
environmental changes, rather than the environmental changes themselves, which
are the root cause of the migration.

37

Point 3 is not about removing environmental influences. When houses fall off eroding
cliffs in California or lava starts flowing through settlements, little option exists but to
migrate, since few support mechanisms exist which would prevent the environmental
changes. The key for this indicator is determining when climate change is the only
environmental change for which support mechanisms might be needed. For instance,
the Californian cliffs have always been prone to erosion, even if climate change
influences the rates. Similarly, any influences which climate change is having or might
have on volcanic activity (McGuire, 2010) do not change the fact that the settlements
were vulnerable to lava flows anyway.
Nonetheless, Table 1 provides key ways which are not covered in this indicator in
which climate change might be a factor in people being forced to migrate. Each factor
in Table 1 has listed a root cause and a possible intervention mechanism which has the
potential for precluding the forced migration or making the migration somewhat
forced and somewhat not forced. As such, being a factor does not mean being the
cause (and an intervention might also cause further problems). Consequently, this
indicator highlights the phrasing `due to climate change only' to understand where
forced migration is truly occurring due to climate change with no other possibilities--
and to avoid climate change being used as a scapegoat because it is easier to blame
climate change than to tackle the real causes of the migration.

In terms of migration due to only climate change impacts, where intervention
mechanisms still exist but the success possibility is low, the main factors are likely to
be:
38

1. Sea-level rise, with three sources (Table 2): (i) slow melting of ice (glaciers, ice
sheets, and permafrost) leading to centimetres of sea-level rise over years and
undermining of traditional ice-based livelihoods; (ii) thermal expansion of water
bodies leading to metres of sea-level rise over decades, and (iii) ice sheet collapse
(Greenland and Antarctica) possibly leading to tens of metres of sea-level rise but
likely over centuries.
2. Changing Arctic ice conditions which cause coastal erosion--sometimes metres per
year--because lack of sea ice leads to wave, storm, and current action on
coastlines.
3. Ocean acidification which could lead to shingle beach erosion or, coupled with
elevated sea-surface temperatures, could lead to major coral mortality through
bleaching which would expose coastlines to the full oceanic power of waves,
storms, and currents without a protective reef.
It is important to be cautious regarding attribution of witnessed changes and
attribution of migration to climate change. Yet what is observed now does not
necessarily indicate the only future possibilities. People might later need to migrate
due to climate change only, such as if accelerated sea-level rise occurs or if places
around the Arctic Ocean become ice free. Therefore, a hierarchy evolves:
1. People in locations migrating now due to climate change only.
2. People in locations which might possibly need to migrate due to climate change
only, most likely due to thermal expansion, lack of sea ice, or ocean acidification
(possibly coupled with other climate change impacts), because these factors tend to
be localised (thermal expansion is global, but as noted in the caveats, displays
regional and local variations). Melting land ice might contribute to this category
through additions to sea-level rise and destabilisation of land and infrastructure as
permafrost melts.
3. People in locations which might possibly to need to migrate due to climate change
only, if ice sheet collapse occurs, because this factor would be a major step change
in global conditions, with regional and local variations, but with a global baseline.
The people in these three sets of locations can be quantified by the population in
them, leading to the indicator being the number of migrants and the number of
communities (as distinct values) migrating only due to climate change according to the
three categories. Only material from peer-reviewed literature is considered.
The robustness of each category is:
1. The number of people in locations migrating now due to climate change only has
high robustness. Nonetheless, new evidence could remove locations from this
category. Around 2010, it became evident that the sea was encroaching so
extensively onto the atoll of Takuu, PNG that migration would likely be inevitable.
While some coastal management had exacerbated the situation, the main
explanation based on available data--although not published in peer-reviewed
literature--appeared to be sea-level rise associated with climate change. Mann et
al.'s (2016) analysis agreed that sea-level rise is measurable around the atoll, but
not that the shoreline changes are due to sea-level rise. Consequently, had this
indicator been developed in 2015 including Takuu, then Takuu would have been
removed in 2016. This situation is a further argument for focusing on peer-reviewed
literature rather than on non-peer reviewed reports of local observations.
2. The number of people in locations who might possibly need to migrate due to
climate change only has medium robustness. Due to lead-time available for this
indicator, strong possibilities exist for taking measures to prevent inevitable
39

migration. In most locations, the need for such measures has been known over the
past few decades with little action resulting. The current political climate is also not
amenable to large-scale action for some time. Consequently, action is feasible to
prevent migration, but does not seem likely before thermal expansion's impacts
become apparent.
3. The number of people in locations who might possibly need to migrate due to ice
sheet collapse has low robustness. Uncertainties are high while manifestation of
ice sheet collapse on the century scale means that numerous other factors could
influence possibilities for, preparation for, and reactions to migration related to ice
sheet collapse.

Caveats from the literature regarding sea-level rise estimates:
(a) Sea-level rise will not be the same everywhere, with significant regional variations
from the global mean (Carson et al. 2016; Clarke et al. 2016).
(b) The rate of sea-level rise is expected to accelerate in coming years (Fasllo et al.
2016; Watson 2016).
41

(c) Sea-level rise is 0.71  0.20 mm/y slower than expected because the climate is
driving increasing water storage on land (Reager et al., 2016).
(d) Sea level might have natural, multi-decadal oscillations (Serazin et al., 2016).
People from many locations are assumed to be migrating due to the possibilities given
as being climate change only, but analysis shows that the assumptions are not always
supported (Table 3). In fact, no outcome is certain. Even for coral reefs, Perry et al.
(2015) postulate that coral growth under some scenarios could keep up with sea-level
rise and other ecosystem changes. Corals' ability to flourish under rapid sea-level
changes was demonstrated empirically in the Solomon Islands by Saunders et al. (2016)
after sudden tectonic subsidence. Similarly, mangroves so far are demonstrating
robustness to sea-level changes while nevertheless being damaged by human activity
(Woodroffe et al. 2010).
In summary, a linear cause-effect assumption is made of:
climate change (impacts) migration health impacts
Each step has nuances, subtleties, and provisos.
For the first step, migration due to climate change (impacts) only is hard to discern
because migration has always happened throughout human history for multiple
reasons, some climate- and environment- related; some not linked at all to climate or
environmental factors; and most often due to a combination of factors. Many
assumptions behind migration potentially linked to climate change are hard to prove as
being climate change only or are challenging to differentiate from many other
environmental factors, such as specific natural hazards or changes to food, water,
and/or livelihood conditions which manifest for multiple reasons.
For the second step, migration itself, no matter how or why migration occurs, does not
necessarily induce specific health outcomes. Migrant and host health could be
improved, worsened, or not affected, depending on how the migration is handled.

Future
Form of
Indicator

Consequently, the main caveats for this indicator is that no linear cause-effect
sequence happens, mainly because the outcomes from a situation depends much more
on how a situation is dealt with than on climate change or migration per se.
Two main prospects exist for this indicator's future. The first is observational. As
estimates and observations of sea-level rise, ocean acidification, sea ice, and coastal
erosion continue, the indicator's thresholds might change. The second is how the
indicator is constructed. Consideration could be given to how managing migration
affects health in order to overcome a principal caveat. Irrespective, this caveat can
never be fully overcome because health impacts can be managed, if we choose to do
so, irrespective of climate change or migration scenarios or realities.
In later iterations of this indicator, descriptions can be provided of locations which
have switched categories, been removed entirely, or been added as new. As these
iterations approach 2030, the tables given for each indicator are likely to expand
substantially because the number of studies is expanding immensely on (i) observed
climate change impacts with confirmed attribution, (ii) projecting such impacts into the
future; and (iii) migration linked to climate change. Consequently, the potential
impacts of climate change on migration are likely to become much clearer towards
2030, including possible case studies where such migration has occurred. Caution is
still needed regarding numerous cases where attribution is stated with confidence, but
the link upon closer examination is not robust. While the indicator here is presented in
42

a highly focused and rigid manner, in order to keep it scientifically precise and robust,
expanding knowledge and observations might permit the indicator in 2030 to be much
more comprehensive and less narrow without losing robustness.

n

Given the complexity of the observational science and the challenges articulated by the
caveats, the ideal form of this indicator given adequate time and resource would be a
map of all potential migration location origins under different climate change
scenarios, animated over time to 2100. Although climate change projections are
published for the next 10,000 years (Clarke et al., 2016), social and technological
changes will be immense over such time scales, making it difficult to provide any
confidence for suggestions regarding how and where people will live and be
responding to environmental stimuli long into the future. If people choose to settle
other planets, solar systems, or galaxies over the next several millennia in order to
escape a dying Earth--as much science fiction (not peer reviewed) has postulated--
would they be climate (change) migrants? Such questions are beyond the scope of
Lancet Countdown. Consequently, to achieve this proposed map with scientific value, it
should not go beyond 2100 and at least one dedicated post-doctoral researcher would
be needed, preferably with a GIS and migration specialty because the number of
caveats, provisos, uncertainties, and attribution challenges would lead to multiple
layers and indicators on a map.
Locations possibly needing to migrate due to climate change only
The proviso `possibly' in this title refers to technical solutions being developed to help
the people stay in or near their current locations, irrespective of the climate change
factors mentioned. These schemes include artificial settlements floating above or built
directly on the current locations (Yamamoto et al., 2014), whether above an island
being submerged, an eroding coastline, or destabilised permafrost. Financing for these
technical proposals has so far been absent and does not seem likely in the near future,
plus technical challenges remain.
Nonetheless, they are possibilities and it is difficult to project the social and political
make-up of the world over the coming decades. The range of possibilities covers
shifting the trillions of dollars per year in military spending and fossil fuel subsidies to
tackling climate change all the way through to abandoning anyone affected by climate
change through refusing to permit them entry into other countries. The most likely
outcomes are somewhere in between such extremes. Consequently, the migration of
these territories remains `possibly' rather than `definitely'.
Additionally, defining `migrating' for this category is not straightforward. Does it mean
moving house, street, municipality, island, or country? Would it include moving 5 m, 50
m, 500 m, or 5 km? For example Pingelap atoll in the Federated States of Micronesia
has significant area above 15 m above sea level but all land is within 300 m of the
coast. If the people of Pingelap move their houses or move to different houses due to
sea-level rise, is that migration, because they are still living in effectively the same
location? If so, then a street-by-street census would be needed of Pingelap and every
other coastline in the world to determine exactly who would need to migrate, due to
regional and local variations in how sea-level rise manifests.
Consequently, a country rather than community level is presented (Table 4),
identifying the countries which might (not definitely) not be able to remain as
countries under thermal expansion. Apart from those people already migrating due to
43

climate change, this indicator yields four countries totalling a population of 584,000
people possibly needing to migrate due to thermal expansion. All four are small island
developing states (SIDS), but this is coincidental; all countries have been considered.

As a guess, the countries in Table 4 would need to migrate between 2040 and 2050.
This statement is a guess, because the decision to migrate will most likely be political
strongly influenced by specific extreme events rather than a strategic analysis of
possible futures and outcomes from those futures. This statement is made on the basis
of history and how societies have typically dealt with disasters and creeping
environmental changes.
As well, other countries could rapidly be added to Table 4. If coral reefs around Fiji or
Seychelles experience high mortality, then near-coastal areas could potentially
experience rapid erosion. Two provisos preclude large numbers of people in each
country, or significant parts thereof, from being forced to migrate. First, while far from
an ideal approach, extensive coastal engineering (which both countries already
implement) could forestay major coastal erosion. Second, plenty of land is available in
those countries which could theoretically take migrants--although with practical
problems regarding access, ownership, and heritage protection--and few people
would necessarily need to migrate far in theory, leading to the problem of defining
`migration' mentioned above. If land tenure or ecosystem protection precludes settling
in areas, is the root cause of migration farther afield climate change or local human
decisions regarding land?
All these factors emphasise the `possibly' word in this indicator's title. They also
highlight that this indicator's value is a minimum, but many more possibilities for
migrants exist under this category--most notably erosion linked to sea ice
disappearance.
Locations which might possibly need to migrate only due to climate change, if ice sheet
collapse occurs
In the coming decades, the numbers of people migrating due to ice sheet collapse is
likely to be near zero. The reason is that the collapse process itself followed by ice melt
and sea-level rise takes a minimum of decades and possibly up to centuries. As we
move from the decade scale to the century scale, it is impossible to project social and
technological developments. It is too simplistic and it would be indefensible to just
calculate the number of people living within a certain elevation above sea level--
especially since over the coming decades, these population numbers will change.
Nonetheless, some websites host data on population in coastal zones such as Columbia
University
http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu
and
the
World
Bank
http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.POP.EL5M.ZS but these are not part of the

http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/natlinfo/indicators/methodology_sheets/oceans_seas
_coasts/pop_coastal_areas.pdf into which the World Bank and Columbia University
data input, but again, it is not published in the peer-reviewed literature. Instead, peerreviewed publications provide the following analyses:
* In 1990, 450 million people lived within 20 km coast and below 20 m above sea level
(Small and Nicholls, 2003). The provided plots permit higher resolution estimates to
be obtained with reasonable precision, but accuracy is questionable.
* In 1994, 1.88 billion people (33.5% of the global population) lived below 100 m above
sea level (Cohen and Small, 1998), which was the highest vertical resolution
investigated.
* In 2000, 634 million (10% of the global population), of whom 360 million are urban,
lived below 10 m above sea level (McGranahan et al., 2007), which was the highest
vertical resolution investigated.
* With 2000 as a baseline, the population living below 10 m above sea level and
connected to the ocean will change from 638 million to, depending on the societal
scenario chosen, 1,005-1,091 million by 2050 and 830-1,184 million by 2100 (Merkins
et al., 2016).
* With 2000 as a baseline, the population living below 10 m above sea level on
contiguous land which borders a major body of water will change from 702.167
million to, depending on the societal scenario chosen, 492.74-1,145.946 million by
2100 (Jones and O'Neill, 2016).
* The number of people living below 5 m above sea level is calculated to be 290 million
(5.4%) in 1990, 380 million (5.6%) in 2010, and 460 million (5.5%) in 2030 (Kummu et
al. 2016).
* For 2000-2006, 67.1-153.1 million people live below 1 m above sea level; 308.1-391.4
million people live below 5 m above sea level; and 557.1-709.1 million people live
below 10 m above sea level (values are also available for below 2, 3, and 4 m above
sea level) depending on the models used (Lichter et al. 2011). This paper also
provides a review of similar literature to date, which plenty of further estimates of
the coastal population.
Consequently, this indicator yields zero extra people migrating due to ice sheet
collapse by 2100; that is, no one would need to migrate who is not already migrating.
After 2100 and in ensuing centuries--without appropriate action--based on the above
literature, as an order of magnitude, perhaps over one billion people +/- 50% might
need to migrate due to ice sheet collapse. This estimate is based on ice sheet collapse
only; as noted above, has low robustness because it is mainly guesswork with large
errors; and has no relation to the estimates of `climate migrants' and `climate change
refugees' which have been debunked by Gemenne (2011) and Hartmann (2010).
Instead, it simply states that if ice sheets collapse and in the absence of major social
and technological changes (an unlikely situation by 2100), then in the decades and
centuries after 2100, over one billion people +/- 50% might need to migrate due to
climate change only.

Methods

2: Adaptation Planning and Resilience for Health
2.1 National adaptation plans for health
In May 2008, the 193 Member States of WHO passed a World Health
Assembly (WHA) Resolution 61.19, calling for stronger action to
address the health risks associated with climate change both through
adaptation and mitigation responses. In addition, the WHO work plan
on Climate Change and Health EB136/16 calls for promotion and
development of tools for more systematic provision of countryspecific information and monitoring of progress. As part of the
fulfilment of this mandate, WHO is actively engaged in the United
Nations framework Convention on Climate Change and together,
WHO and the UNFCCC collaborated on the development of climate
and health country profiles to provide ministers of health and health
decision-makers with national estimates of the climate hazards,
health impacts, potential health co-benefits of mitigation actions and
status of national policy response in their countries.
The collection of data for this exercise includes a biennial national
survey, entitled the "WHO Climate and Health Country Survey",
which is sent to all WHO member states and is completed by ministry
of health focal points. Results from the country survey together with

the WHO Climate and Health Country Profiles form the basis of
WHO's global monitoring of national progress on climate and health
action.
The data presented in this report reflect the responses of 40
countries that participated in the 2015 baseline WHO Climate and
Health Country Survey.
Validation of the 2015 country reported data was undertaken as part
of the development and review of the WHO UNFCCC Climate and
Health Country Profiles. Key climate and health stakeholders
including the ministry of health and other related government bodies
were invited to review country specific findings. The validated data
presented in this report are for 40 countries, including; Algeria,
Bangladesh, Bhutan, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia,
China, Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji, France, Germany, Ghana,
Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Jordan, Kenya, Lao People's

WHO Climate and Health Country Survey
The survey sample may not be representative of all countries as this
survey was voluntary, and the baseline sample tended to include
countries that had active climate and health projects or countries
that were working directly with WHO on climate and health projects.
As such the overall results may tend to be positively biased but still
provide valuable insights into the status of national policy response
for participating countries from all WHO regions and representing a
diverse range of low, middle and high income nations with varying
population sizes, climatic and geographic characteristics and different
vulnerabilities to the impacts of climate change.
The WHO Climate and Health Country Survey will be conducted
biennially and will aim to gather data from all WHO member States,
with the specific goal of doubling the number of survey respondents
to 80 participating member states in the next iteration of the survey
(2017).

Based on this data two indicators can be developed. The first is a global cities based
indicator of government areas that have undertaken a climate change risk or

vulnerability of health infrastructure to climate change.
CDP data cities
This is a sample survey of 449 public results, are self-reported. As such, the results
are not representative and are not necessarily reliable, owing to their being based on
self-reporting cities.
In future, this indicator will aim to expand the number of cities included in the survey
and to have a more regionally representative sample. Also, the quality of the climate
change risk assessments and implementation rate of any associated plans would be
important to analyse.

2.3 Detection, preparedness, and response to health emergencies
Under the International Health Regulations (IHR (2005)) all States Parties are

to the World Health Assembly annually on the implementation of IHR (2005). In
order to facilitate this process, WHO developed an IHR Monitoring questionnaire 2,
interpreting the Core Capacity Requirements in Annex 1 of IHR (2005) into 20
indicators for 13 capacities. Since 2010, this self-reporting IHR monitoring
questionnaire is sent annually to National IHR Focal Points (NFPs) for data collection.
It contains a checklist of 20 indicators specifically developed for monitoring the
development and implementation of 13 IHR capacities. The method of estimation
calculates the proportion/percentage of attributes (a set of specific elements or
functions which reflect the level of performance or achievement of a specific
indicator) reported to be in place in a country.
The core capacities to implement the International Health Regulations (2005) have
been established by a technical group of experts, as those capacities required to
detect, assess, notify and report events, and to respond to public health risks and
emergencies of national and international concern. To assess the development and
strengthening of core capacities, a set of components are measured for each of the
core capacities, by considering a set of one to three indicators that measure the
status and progress in developing and strengthening the IHR core capacities. Each
indicator is assessed by using a group of specific elements referred to as `attributes'
that represents a complex set of activities or elements required to carry out this
component. As it is difficult to measure these indicators with a simple question that
requires one `yes' or `no' answer, one to three questions are derived from each
attribute, and these are administered through a questionnaire. The status of
performance for an indicator, component and core capacity is determined by the
presence of attributes. If a country does not indicate a particular attribute as absent
or present, it is counted as absent for scoring purposes. The annual questionnaire has
been conducted since 2010 with a response rate of 72% in 2012, 66% in 2016, and
99% of countries reporting at least once since 2010. Annual reporting results are
complemented by after action reviews, simulation exercises, and joint external
evaluation (JEE).
International Health Regulations (2005) Annual Reporting
This indicator does not show the implementation status of IHR core capacities for all
countries - it only reports on those countries who reported.
In future, this indicator would hope to consider additional data sources beyond the
IHR Reporting Questionnaires and expand the number of countries included in the
results, to strengthen the global picture of the available human resources to prepare,
respond and adapt to climate-related health impacts.
Closer alignment will be sought with the monitoring of SDG 3D, "Strengthen the
capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk
reduction and management of national and global health risks". Indicator 3.D.1 is
also measured by: "International Health Regulations (IHR) capacity and health
emergency preparedness."
The indicator may be expanded to include more detailed information provided
through the complementary IHR joint external evaluation instruments; or the
monitoring systems for the Sendai Framework 3, including data from WHO's reports
on country capacities for health emergency and disaster risk management, which
may in the future provide a complementary system to track health outcomes, effects
on health services and the community and national capacities to manage the health
risks of climate related emergencies and disasters. Furthermore, this indicator could

3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits
3.1: Carbon intensity of the energy system
Technical definition is the tonnes of CO emitted for each unit (TJ) of
primary energy supplied.
The rationale for the indicator choice is that carbon intensity of the energy
system will provide information on the level of fossil fuel use, which have
associated air pollution impacts. Higher intensity values indicate a more
fossil dominated system, and one that is likely to have a higher coal share.
As countries pursue climate mitigation goals, the carbon intensity is likely
to reduce with benefits for air pollution.
The indicator is calculated based on total CO2 emissions from fossil fuel
combustion divided by Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES). TPES reflects
the total amount of primary energy used in a specific country, accounting
for the flow of energy imports and exports.

Data

Caveats

The data are available for most countries of the world, for the period 19712013.
This indicator is based on based on the energy balances from the
International Energy Agency. The source reference is:

The indicator does not provide information on the share of different fossil
fuels, their use in different sectors, and the absolute levels of usage. These
are all important elements in understanding the air pollution emissions,

and their impacts. Therefore, additional indicators (3.2 & 3.3) provide
additional complimentary information.
This indicator will need to be updated to provide the data for the most
recent years, which have seen important shifts in the use of fossil fuels,
particularly coal.
3. Mitigation Actions and Health Co-Benefits
3.2. Coal phase-out.
Two indicators are used here; i) Total primary coal supply by region /
country (in EJ units), and ii) Share of electricity generation from coal (% of
total generation from coal).
These indicators are important for enable a tracking of change in coal
consumption at a regional and country level. Due to the level of coal used
for power generation, a second indicator tracks the contribution to
electricity generation from coal power plants in selected countries. As
countries pursue climate mitigation goals, the use of coal is likely to reduce
with benefits for air pollution.
The indicator on primary energy coal supply is an aggregation of all coal
types used across all sectors (from the IEA energy balances). The indicator
on the share of electricity generation from coal is estimated based on
electricity generated from coal plant as a percentage of total electricity
generated.

Data

The data are available for most countries of the world, for the period 19712013. Only the period from 1990 has been used, due to data gaps for
selected countries prior to 1990. Countries with large levels of coal use (as
a share of generation, or in absolute terms), have been selected.
This indicator is based on based on the energy balances from the
International Energy Agency. The source reference is:

These indicators provides a proxy for air quality emissions associated with
the combustion of coal. Further work is required to convert coal use by
sector and type into emissions of different air quality pollutants.
In the future, this indicator set could be developed to also estimate the
actual air pollutant emissions associated with coal use. This will require
sectoral use, coal type (both of which are available) and appropriate
emission factors.
As per 3.1, this indicator will need to be updated to provide the data for
the most recent years, which have seen important shifts in the use of coal.

3.3. Zero-carbon emission electricity.
Two indicators are used here, and presented in two ways; i) Total low
carbon electricity generation, in absolute terms (TWh) and as a % share of
total electricity generated (to include nuclear, and all renewables), and ii)
Total renewable generation (excluding hydro), in TWh, and as a % share of
total electricity generated.
The increase in the use of low carbon and renewable energy for electricity
generation will push other fossil fuels, such as coal, out of the mix over
time, resulting in an improvement in air quality, with benefits to health.
The renewables (excluding hydro) indicator has been used to allow for the
tracking of rapidly emergent renewable technologies. For both indicators,
generation, rather than capacity, has been chosen as a metric as the
electricity generated from these technologies is what actually displaces
fossil-based generation. Countries with large levels of low carbon
generation (as shares, or in absolute terms), or with higher fossil
dependency, have been selected.
The data are again taken from the IEA energy balances. The absolute level
indicators are total gross electricity generated aggregated from the
relevant technology types. The share indicators are estimated as the low
carbon or renewable generation as a % of total generation.

Data

The data are available for most countries of the world, for the period 19712013. Only the period from 1990 has been used, due to data gaps for
selected countries prior to 1990.
This indicator is based on based on the energy balances from the

population reporting that any cooking, heating or lighting, expressed as
percentage.
"Clean" is defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel
recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in
the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household
fuel combustion."
[Above definition from SDG Metadata]

Data

The indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO.
Estimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban and rural
population for a given year are obtained separately using a multilevel
model (Bonjour et al., 2013)[1]. This is done at the country level.
Estimates of fuel use are derived from WHO household survey data from
~800 nationally representative survey and censuses, including
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement
Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health
Survey (WHS), and others.
For cooking fuels, coverage of 157 countries is available through the WHO
Global Household Energy Database.
For lighting fuels, the WHO database includes data for 76 countries. For
heating fuels, the WHO database includes data for 16 countries. Time
series:

Caveats

Future Form of
Indicator

From 1980 to 2014
The indicator is based on the main type of fuel and technology used for
cooking as cooking occupies the largest share of overall household energy
needs.
However, this will not reflect household fuel use activities when multiple
fuels are used through the day or year. There is also a lack of data on the
type of fuel and technologies used for home heating and lighting.
An ideal indicator going forward be further details on the fuel mix used by
households for different demands (heating, cooling, cooking, hot water,
lighting and other plug loads) for a range of income groupings within the
country. The pressures of interest are the GHG and air pollution emissions
that contribute to climate change and health outcomes, but also the
increased access to energy use, which has broader socio-economic
benefits.

Methods

This indicator measures urban background annual average concentration

from monitoring stations located in urban background, residential,
commercial, and mixed areas.
Data

Data on annual average concentration of fine particulate (PM2.5) air
pollution in urban areas was compiled from the latest version of the
WHO's Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database (2016 update).
The database assembled air pollution data from public data sources
including national/subnational reports and websites, regional networks,
agencies (e.g. UN), and academic publications.
The database contains estimated annual mean PM10 and PM2.5
concentrations in almost 3,000 cities in 103 countries covering the period
2008 to 2015.
The cities included in this indicator are 143 cities from the Sustainable
Healthy Urban Environments (SHUE) database for which there was an air
pollution estimate in the WHO data. SHUE is an initiative, funded by the
Wellcome Trust, to support policy development in areas relating to
environmental and health challenges and opportunities in cities. It aims to
test the feasibility and methods of assembling data about the
characteristics of a globally distributed sample of cities, and the
populations within them, for comparative analyses, and to use such data to
assess how policies may contribute to sustainable urban development and
human health.
Data on city-level GDP for SHUE cities were compiled from various sources,
including the Brookings Institute, Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD), and World Bank. Where city-level data was
unavailable, regional or national data was used.

This indicator focuses specifically on the links between the energy
sector and primary air pollution production, with data, analysis and
projections in the report including energy production, transformation
and use (i.e. the entire energy value chain, from extraction to final use).
This coverage includes both combustion and non-combustion
emissions (e.g. process emissions in industry, non-tailpipe emissions in
transport)
Data are broadly only specific to countries/regions (United States, Latin
America, European Union, Middle East Africa, Russia, China, India,
Southeast Asia)
Updating of the data outputs is sporadic - the IEA publication was a
"special report" and not a routine publication.

Data are not specifically a measure of the health co-benefits of climate
action (see below).
Future development
of indicator

An ideal indicator would directly map sources of primary air pollution to
exposures and attributable health impacts on a country-level or more
granularly. Furthermore, it would disaggregate air pollution sources by
type (e.g. coal-fired power plant, cars) and include sources outside of the
energy sector. In turn, it would be able to quantify the co-impacts on air
quality and human health directly resulting from climate change mitigation
efforts both in and outside of the energy sector.

Indicator

3.5 Exposure to ambient air pollution

Sub-Indicator

3.5.3 Premature mortality from ambient air pollution

Methods

This indicator quantifies contributions of individual source sectors to
ambient PM2.5 exposure and its health impacts.

Data

Estimates of sectoral source contributions to annual mean exposure to
ambient PM2.5 were calculated using the GAINS model (Amann et al.,
2011), which combines bottom-up emission calculations with atmospheric
chemistry and dispersion coefficients. Atmospheric transfer coefficients
are based on full year simulations with the EMEP Chemistry Transport
Model (Simpson et al. 2012) at 0.5x0.5 resolution using meteorology of
2015 and include a downscaling to capture sub-grid urban concentration
gradients. Calculated ambient PM2.5 concentrations have been validated
against in-situ observations from the latest version of the WHO's Urban
Ambient Air Pollution Database (2016 update), and other sources where
available (e.g. Chinese statistical yearbook).
Premature deaths from total ambient PM2.5 are calculated using the
methodology of the WHO (2016) assessment on the burden of disease
from ambient air pollution, which relies on integrated exposure response
relationships (IERs) developed within the Global Burden of Disease 2013
59

study (Forouzanfar et al., 2015). Disease and age specific baseline mortality
rates are taken from the GBD Results database
(http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool).
Attribution of estimated premature deaths from AAP to polluting sectors
was done proportional to the contributions of individual sectors to
population-weighted mean PM2.5 in each country.
Caveats

*
*

The indicator relies on model calculations which are currently
available for a limited set of countries (Europe, South Asia, East Asia)
uncertainty in the shape of integrated exposure-response
relationships (IERs) make the quantification of health burden
inherently uncertain

The non-linearity of the IERs used complicates the translation between the
mortality burden attributed to an individual source, which is calculated
proportional to the source contribution to ambient PM2.5, and the effect of
mitigating this source. While a reduction of emissions would lead to a
(roughly) proportional reduction of ambient PM2.5, this would not result in
a proportional reduction of the health burden. In highly polluted
environments, the health benefits of a marginal reduction of emissions
would be disproportionately smaller than the relative change in
concentrations.
Future development
of indicator

An ideal indicator would provide a marker of benefits for air quality and/or
health that are directly attributable to climate change mitigation action,
which requires scenario analysis. Going beyond a sectoral split, a more
explicit quantification of effects of fossil-fuel versus non-fossil fuel based
activities should be undertaken.
The spatial coverage should be expanded to global coverage, and other
health indicators than premature deaths should be included for a more
complete assessment of the health burden, particularly Years of Life Lost
(YLLs) and Years Lived with Disability (YLDs).

This indicator does not explicitly quantify the impact associated with
transitioning to transport fuels that are less polluting, though it does
provide trends that can be used as a proxy. It also cannot, at this time, be
disaggregated to the urban level.
An ideal indicator would capture the direct health impacts of the use of
transport fuels, with country- and urban-level specificity within the global
coverage. In turn, the co-benefits of transitioning to less-polluting fuels
would be quantified directly in terms of reduced exposures to air pollution
and their corresponding health impact.

This indicator provides information on sustainable travel uptake using
available data on the proportion of all journeys in world cities made by
private transport, public transport, walking and cycling. Both single year
estimates of modal share and trends in modal share have a number of
62

caveats.
Data on modal share in cities:
*

*

*

The data presented in this indicator include the most recent data
available for a particular city. Transport surveys in different cities
and countries have different methods, which may limit
comparability. Transport surveys also tend to undercount short
trips (particularly those made by foot), with the amount of bias
likely to vary between surveys.
Data on modal share classifies journeys by the main mode of
travel. The main mode of travel is typically the mode that covers
the most distance. This way of classifying journeys misses some
sustainable travel that takes place as part of longer journeys with
multiple stages. For instance, driving to a public transport station
near the edge of the city and continuing the journey by public
transport.
Data does not take into account distance travelled

Data on trends in modal share has the additional caveat:
The methodology of transport surveys changes over time, which may limit
comparability even within one city.
Future development
of indicator

The data currently included in this indicator come from an initial scoping of
available data. An ideal indicator would include data from a systematic
search of travel data in all selected cities and countries. This may involve
contacting survey teams in different countries to provide estimates or
access to the desired data.
To more fully capture sustainable uptake a future indicator could collate
data on the proportion of total distance travelled made by different modes
of transport. Other data on sustainable travel infrastructure, for instance,
the presence of cycle schemes would be useful.

3.8. Ruminant meat for human consumption

Methods

Total amount of ruminant meat available for consumption (kg/capita/year)
and proportion of energy available from ruminant meat for human
consumption (%) compared to all sources of energy, aggregated by WHO
region from country-specific data over 1990-2013.

Data

Data comes from UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Food
Balance Sheets. The country-specific data was compiled by the statistics
division of the FAO from the national supply and utilization accounts of
primary foods and processed commodities, adding food imports,
subtracting food exports, food fed to animals, and waste/losses (assumed
as 10%), adjusting for changes in food stocks, and dividing country
population (mostly mid-year population estimates).

Caveats

All sources of data have some notable limitations. Estimates from each
country use different calculation methods and include different elements,
limiting comparability. In the UK, there have been changes in the method of
63

estimating emissions over time.
Although we used the amount and proportion of energy from ruminant
meat as a proxy indicator for food groups with some of the highest levels of
GHG emissions, it is important to note that emissions are also high for
other food groups, especially from other meat and dairy products. The
graphs below show the proportion of energy available from animal
products and the proportion of protein available from animal products. The
proportion of energy available from animal products is highest in the
Americas, where trends suggest a slight increase, and Europe, where trends
suggest a slight decrease. Proportions are notably low in South East Asia.
Trends suggest proportion of energy from animal products is increasing
most rapidly in the Western Pacific with slower increases apparent in the
Eastern Mediterranean and South East Asia. The proportion of protein
avaialbe from animal products follows similar trends to the proportion of
energy from animal products: highest in the Americas and Europe, lowest
in South East Asia, and growing most rapidly in the Western Pacific.
These measures on animal product availability may be useful for tracking
progress on shifting away from animal intensive products to more a more
plant based diets. However, since the evidence relating consumption of
non-red meat and dairy products to adverse health outcomes is currently
less clear than for consumption of red meat, we did not include any
measure of animal product availability in the core indicators.

64

Future development
of indicator

An ideal method for tracking progress would use a set of indicators
reflecting climate and health progress at each level of the DPSEEA
framework. For the development of such indicators, considerable effort is
required in terms of systematic data collection (e.g. emission and actual
food intake data) and methodological developments for context-sensitive
data collection, monitoring, and definition of targets for sustainable food
production and consumption, particularly in terms of GHG-intensity and
health impact.

3.9. Healthcare sector emissions

Methods

This indicator collects data on the MtCO2e attributable to the health care
sector from published reports.

Data source

Data from the UK comes from published reports from the Sustainable
Development Unit (NHS). Estimates of GHG emissions include emissions
from building energy use, travel to and from sites, and goods and services
purchased from the health care sector.
Data from the US comes from an article by Eckelman & Sherman (2016)
[3]. Estimates are modelled using data on health care expenditures.
Data from Australia comes from a published report from the Department
of Health in Victoria. Estimates take into account GHG associated with
products and food purchased by one municipality (Southern Health),
waste, and transportation. To extrapolate to the whole Victorian Health
system estimates from Southern Health were scaled up to all of Victoria
using separations (as a measure of activity) and floor area.

Caveats

All sources of data have some notable limitations. Estimates from each
country use different calculation methods and include different elements,
limiting comparability. In the UK, there have been changes in the method
of estimating emissions over time. Finally, the indicator does not adjust for
65

the size (or changes in the size) of the health care system.
The future (ideal)
indicators

A future set of indicators would reflect country-wide GHG emissions of
health care systems with denominators of the system size and volume of
health care service provision. Indicators should be available at each level of
policy and managerial decision-making to inform choices and facilitate
selection of policies and organizational operations with lowest GHG
emission levels.
Additionally, efficiency of health care system performance in relation to
climate change can be evaluated by modelling global health risks
attributed to the GHG emissions of each health care system as a
proportion of their contribution to the health of the population. Mitigation
strategies could be designed in collaboration with relevant sectors, such as
the insurance sector or health care commissioners and providers.

4.1. Investments in Zero-Carbon Energy and Energy Efficiency
The data for this indicator are sourced from the annual IEA World Energy
Investment publication. Four categories of investment are defined:
Renewables & Nuclear - investment in all renewable and nuclear electricity
generation, and renewable transport and heating (including biofuels and
solar thermal heating)
Energy Efficiency - See below.
Electricity Networks - investment in electricity transmission and
distribution infrastructure.
Fossil Fuels - including oil, gas and coal, upstream mining, drilling and
pipeline infrastructure, and coal, gas and oil power and other energy
generation capacity.
For most sectors, `investment' is defined as overnight capital expenditures
on new assets. For some sectors, such as power generation, this investment
is attributed to the year in which a new plant or the upgrade of an existing
one becomes operational. For other sources, such as upstream oil and gas
and LNG projects, where sufficient data are available, investment reflects
the capital spending incurred over time as production from a new source
ramps up to maintain output from an existing asset. For energy efficiency,
`investment' is defined as incremental spending by companies,
governments and individuals to acquire equipment that consumes less
energy than that which they would otherwise have bought.
Other areas of expenditure, including operation and maintenance, research
and development, financing costs, mergers and acquisitions or public
markets transactions, are not included. Investment estimates are derived
from IEA data for energy demand, supply and trade, and estimates of unit
capacity costs, For more information, see IEA (2016 i,2017 ii).
Here, `renewables and nuclear' includes investment in all renewable and
nuclear electricity generation capacity, and renewable transport and
heating (including biofuels and solar thermal heating). `Electricity networks'
includes investment in electricity transmission and distribution
infrastructure. Investment in fossil fuels includes upstream mining, drilling
and pipeline infrastructure for oil, gas and coal, and power and other
energy generation capacity for the use of these fuels. For these categories,
investment' is defined as overnight capital expenditures on new assets. For
energy efficiency, `investment' is defined as incremental spending by
companies, governments and individuals to acquire equipment that
consumes less energy than that which they would otherwise have bought.

4.3. Funds Divested from Fossil Fuels
The data for this indicator are collected and provided by 350.org. iii They
represent the total assets (or assets under management, AUM) for
institutions that have publicly committed to divest in 2016 (for which data is
available), with non-US$ values converted using the market exchange rate
when the commitment was made, and thus do not directly represent the
actual sums divested from fossil fuel companies. A company is committed
to `divestment' if it falls into any of the following five categories:
- `Fossil Free' - An institution or corporation that does not have any
investments (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual funds
containing shares, corporate bonds) in fossil fuel companies (coal, oil,
natural gas) and committed to avoid any fossil fuel investments in the
future
- `Full' - An institution or corporation that made a binding commitment to
divest (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual funds containing
72

shares, corporate bonds) from any fossil fuel company (coal, oil, natural
gas).
- `Partial' - An institution or corporation that made a binding
commitment to divest across asset classes from some fossil fuel companies
(coal, oil, natural gas), or to divest from all fossil fuel companies (coal, oil,
natural gas), but only in specific asset classes (e.g. direct investments,
domestic equity).
- `Coal and Tar Sands' - An institution or corporation that made a binding
commitment to divest (direct ownership, shares, commingled mutual funds
containing shares, corporate bonds) from any coal and tar sands companies.

Due to confidentiality issue, the full dataset is not available for publication.
However, interested readers may visit the 350.org website for further
information. I
See `Methods'.
The ideal future form of this indicator would have two elements. The first
element would track the value of institutional investments in fossil fuels
assets, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of their total portfolios.
This would also allow for tracking of associated funds that are moved out of
fossil fuels, but are not explicitly advertised as `divesting'. However, such
data is unlikely to be available. As such, an indicator that aligns with the
data compiled by Bouvet, L and Kirjanas, P. (2017) iv will be investigated.
The second element of this indicator would more explicitly track the value
of funds divested from fossil fuels by healthcare institutions. The data
provided for the indicator in this paper may be improved upon through, for
example, the issuance of annual surveys either as part of other data
collection efforts from healthcare institutions, or independently. The
feasibility of each option will be investigated for future publications.
Just 17 organisations recorded as committed to divestment above are `forprofit' corporations (however, these account for $3.16 trillion (58%) of the
total asset value presented above). Pension funds and other institutional
investors (for example, insurance companies), which in 2013 held assets
under management worth $93 trillion in the OECD alone (larger than the
sum of global economic output in that year - $76.8 trillion), also account for
a small proportion of the organisations committed to divestment (12% at
the end of 2016).232,233 Institutional investors are substantial investors in
fossil fuel companies, due to the historically sizable, yet stable returns
generated.
Policy makers are increasingly keen to encourage (or require) institutional
investors to properly assess and disclose their exposure to climate-related
risk. In December 2015, the Financial Stability Board established the `Task
Force on Climate-Related Finance Disclosures', with the aim of developing
financial risk assessment and disclosure approaches related to the physical,
liability and transition risks associated with climate change. In June 2017,
the Task Force published their final report on recommendations to achieve
this objective.234,235 In January 2017, the European Union (EU) introduced
73

the recast IORP (`Institutions for occupational retirement provision')
Directive, which states that IORPs (pension funds) `...as part of their risk
management system... should include...risks related to climate
change...[and] to the depreciation of assets due to regulatory change
(`stranded assets').236

4.4. Economic Losses due to Climate-Related Events
Munch Re NatCatSERVICE provided the data for this indicator. The NatCatSERVICE
is a global database of natural catastrophe (`nat cat') data. Munich Re has been
systematically recording information on natural catastrophe loss events from
around the world since 1994. This has developed into one of the world's most
comprehensive databases for information on natural catastrophe loss events. Data
suitable for systematic and analytical evaluation on a worldwide scale are available
from 1980 onwards. For this paper, a base year of 1990 was chosen in order to
align with the base year against which GHG emission reduction targets are
commonly set.
NatCatSERVICE collect a range of information for around 1,200 events each year.
For this paper, aside from descriptive and locational information, only data on
direct economic loss (physical/tangible losses, expressed in US$2016), insured
losses (all paid-out insured physical/tangible losses) and fatalities are used. Please
refer to the online NatCatSERVICE Methodology document, which may be found
online
(http://natcatservice.munichre.com/assets/pdf/NatCatSERVICE_Methodology.pdf).
The Table below illustrates the `peril classification' provided by NatCatSERVICE.
Perils classified as Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological have been
included in the analysis. Geophysical perils are excluded, due to their general

Each natural catastrophe event recorded is assigned a direct economic loss, and
where applicable, an insured loss, expressed in nominal US$ values. Where these
are available, data are taken from official institutions, but where not, estimates are
calculated. The process for estimation calculation depends on what data is
available. For example, if loss estimates from insurance market data is available,
this data may be combined with data on insurance penetration and other eventspecific information to estimate total economic losses. If only low-quality
information is available, such as a description of the number of homes damaged or
destroyed, assumptions on value and costs are made.
Loss values are presented in US$, or if initially expressed in local currency,
converted to US$ using the market exchange rates at the end of the month when
the event occurred. Values are converted to US$2016 using country-specific
Consume Price Indices (CPI).
Once the data was received from the NatCatSERVICE, further analysis was
undertaken. Firstly, each country was assigned to its income group as defined by
the World Bank. Secondly, to allow `intensity' calculations as illustrated in Figure 2,
economic losses (insured and uninsured) were divided by annual GDP values for
each income grouping, sourced from the World Bank Database and deflated to
US$2016 using data sourced from the US Department of Commerce Bureau of
Economic Analysis. v 2016 data for GDP is estimated by multiplying the 2015 value
by the average annual the growth rate from the previous 5 years. Fatality data
were divided by the relevant annual population of each income grouping, also
sourced from the World Bank Database (with 2016 data estimated using same
approach as for GDP). Values presented in the paper text are rounded to the
nearest 0.05.

See `Method'.
An ideal form of this indicator would allow attribution of fatalities and economic
losses to events induced by climate change. However, such attribution is unlikely to
be feasible over the course of the Lancet Countdown. As such, it is not envisaged
that this indicator will significantly alter.

4. Economics and Finance
4.5. Employment in Low-Carbon and High-Carbon Sectors
The data for this indicator is sourced from IRENA (2017) vi (renewables) and
IBISWorld (2016 vii; 2017 viii) (fossil fuel extraction). Bioenergy includes liquid
biofuels, solid biomass and biogas. `Other technologies' includes
geothermal energy, small hydropower, concentrated solar power, municipal
and industrial waste, and ocean energy. Fossil fuel extraction values include
direct employment, whereas renewable energy jobs include direct and
indirect employment (e.g. equipment manufacturing).

The data for this indictor is sourced from IRENA (renewables) and IBIS
World (fossil fuel extraction). 25,26, 27 Bioenergy includes liquid biofuels,
soil biomass and biogas. `Other technologies' includes geothermal energy,
small hydropower, concentrated solar power, municipal and industrial
waste, and ocean energy. Fossil fuel extraction values include direct
employment, whereas renewable energy jobs include direct and indirect
employment (e.g. equipment manufacturing).
Fossil fuel extraction values include direct employment, whereas renewable
energy jobs include direct and indirect employment (e.g. equipment
manufacturing).
An ideal future form of this indicator would track both direct and indirect
employment from the renewables and fossil fuel extraction industries,
along with the geographical distribution in their change over time. This
would allow for an assessment of substitution. However, at present such
data is unavailable, and impractical to collect for the purposes of the Lancet
Countdown alone.
4. Economics and Finance
4.6. Fossil Fuel Subsidies
The data for this indicator are taken from the International Energy Agency
(IEA), and is calculated using the price-gap approach, for 42 mostly nonOECD countries (see data below). The `price-gap' approach is the most
commonly applied methodology for quantifying consumption subsidies. It
compares average end-user prices paid by consumers with reference prices
that correspond to the full cost of supply. The price gap is the amount by
which an end-use price falls short of the reference price and its existence
indicates the presence of a subsidy. Prices are converted to US2016 using
data sourced from the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic
Analysis.v To view the original data, a full description of the price-gap
approach and the data employed to calculate it, please see IEA (2017) ix

The data for this indicator is provided by the IEA, and calculated using the
price-gap approach, for 42 mostly non-OECD countries (see Appendix 5 for
further details). Fossil fuel production subsidies and consumption subsidies
for most OECD countries are not included, due to the lack of consistent
data. However, the vast majority of fossil fuel subsidies are consumer
subsidies in non-OECD countries. In 2014, consumer subsidies in OECD
countries were worth less than 14% of the non-OECD value, with producer
subsidies worth around 4%.248 As such, the indicator presented provides a
broad overview of global trends in fossil fuel subsidies.
An ideal future form of this indicator would have two key elements. The
first element would be the consistent inclusion of production and
consumption subsidies for all countries, available on an annual basis. The
second element would be the use of this data, along with that of carbon
pricing data (see Indicator 4.9), to create a since `net carbon price'
indicator. The future practicality of this indicator will depend on the
availability of data at the appropriate level of granularity.

Methods

The World Bank provides the data for this indicator, through the interactive `Carbon
Pricing Dashboard'. x Prices for 2016 and 2017 are those as of 1st August 2016 and 1st
April 2017, respectively. For 2017, the indicator includes only instruments that had
been introduced by 1st April 2017. Baseline-and-credit systems are excluded from the
analysis. GHG coverage data is presented as a proportion of 2012 global
anthropogenic GHG emissions (53, 937 MTCO2e) as calculated by EDGAR (Emissions
Database for Global Atmospheric Research) xi. Monetary values are presented in US$,
in current prices.

Instrument coverage of GHG emissions, in both absolute and proportional term, are
based on total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2012 - the last year in which
consistent data was available. `Baseline and Credit' instruments are not included due
to a lack of price data. Some instruments experience an overlap in coverage. For
example, the UK Carbon Price Floor applies to the power sector in the UK, which is
also subject to carbon pricing under the EU ETS. Other instruments experience only
partial overlap. As such, total emissions coverage is likely to be overestimated (ceteris
paribus), although this effect is likely to be minor. The price used to calculate the
weighted average prices are the prevailing prices on a single day. The prices for many
instruments (particularly ETS instruments) are likely to alter of the course of a year,
however the effect on the final value is likely to be minor. Prices are presented in
current values.

Indicator 4.8. Use of Carbon Pricing Revenues
Methods Data on revenue generated is provided by the World Bank's interactive `Carbon Pricing
Dashboard'.Error! Bookmark not defined. Data for the division into the four categories of
revenue expenditure are provided largely by Carl and Fedor (2016), supplemented by
external sources (as described below).
The method of revenue expenditure classification is also adapted from Carl and Fedor
(2016) xii. Definitions and assumptions regarding the categories as applied in this paper
are as follows:
Climate Change Mitigation - revenues are explicitly allocated to activities or
infrastructure that seeks to reduce, or enable the reduction, of greenhouse gas
emissions, from any source, within or outside of the sectors or jurisdiction in which
the carbon price is applied.
Climate Change Adaptation - as above, but for adaptation activities or infrastructure.
Environmental Tax Reform (ETR) - revenues are explicitly returned to some broad
86

portion of the population through individual or business tax rate cuts, tax eliminations,
or rebates in order to achieve broad revenue neutrality. Revenue returned to directly
compensate for the cost of GHG emissions (through free permit allocation or targeted
assistance for energy-intensive, trade-exposed firms) are not included).
General Funds - revenues are explicitly used for purposes other than those described
above, or the use of revenues is unspecified or information is unavailable.
Only revenue that may be considered government income is included. For example,
revenue generated by sale of permits issued to utilities under the Californian cap and
trade instrument, which much then be used to finance discounts on household energy
bills through `carbon credits', are not considered, as this revenue does not pass
through the State government. Instruments for which price data is not available,
either due to the type of instrument or simply lack of data, are not included.
Other assumptions as applied to individual instruments are described below.

allocated to health-related measures. The availability of such data, or the possibility to
collect it, will be investigated for future publications.

4.9 Spending on adaptation for health and health-related activities
The `Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change' dataset measures spending
on economic activities related to adaptation and resilience to climate change. It
was developed by data research firm kMatrix in partnership with numerous
stakeholders, and includes the key adaptation measures identified by the IPCC.
This classification of adaptation activities was originally developed from
attempts by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to
88

measure adaptation in 2009/2010. The definition of adaptation activities was
extended through collaboration with the Greater London Authority in 2014. In
2017, the definition of adaptation and resilience activities has been updated
through a project with Climate-KIC, which has added several new industrial
sectors as well as significantly expanding the activities under health and
healthcare.
The methodology used for data acquisition and analysis is based on a system
called as `profiling', which was originally developed at Harvard Business School
to track and analyse technical and industrial change. This is the basis for building
taxonomies of economic activities and value chains, which can then be
populated with estimates of key economic metrics like sales value and
employment by triangulating transactional and operational business data to
estimate economic values. This methodology is particularly valuable in areas
where government statistics and standard industry classifications are not
available. When measuring an industry or sector, the new taxonomy is
populated from the bottom up, searching for evidence for the ideal definition
and including only economic activities where sufficient evidence is available.
For each transaction listed in the adaptation economy data, a minimum of seven
separate sources must independently record the transaction for it to be
confirmed and included in our database. Triangulating data from multiple
sources permits large volumes of unsorted, fragmented data of different types
from different sources to be processed to arrive at more accurate estimates of
transactional value that would not be possible using a single source. For the
adaptation economy, data are produced to a confidence level of around 80%.
Accessing and analysing multiple types of data is also key to identifying the
`purpose' behind an economic activity, which is key for accurately assigning
economic activities to the adaptation dataset.
Developing the new definition of adaptation and resilience to climate change
involved the top-down taxonomy of the entire make and mend' economy, and
then adaptation and resilience in all forms. Then these categories were filtered
to isolate economic activities that can be strictly identified as being relevant to
adaptation and resilience to climate change. The taxonomy of A&RCC is drawn
from 11 sectors of the economy at-large: Agriculture & Forestry, Built
Environment, Disaster-Preparedness, Energy, Health, ICT, Natural Environment,
Professional Services, Transport, Waste and Water.
From across the entire adaptation and resilience to climate change dataset, it
was seen that there are a number of activities across different sectors that are
`health-related', outside of the strictly-defined healthcare sector. Part of the
design of the indicator therefore required the definition of those activities from
the other 10 sectors of the A&RCC data that can be clearly related to health, and
thus should be included in a definition of `health-related' adaptation spending.
An initial exploration of the A&RCC dataset had yielded a `three-tier' approach
for the categorization of health-related adaptation activities;
1) adaptation activities with direct, important health impacts, that clearly and
directly protect health in substantial ways, or address major contributors to
89

burdens of disease
2) those with less direct or more minor health impacts, that indirectly benefit
human health, or prevent minor impacts of burdens of disease
3) activities that primarily protect infrastructure and investment, those with no
health impact or an impact on human health that is too circuitous or indirect.
A robust interim approach was adopted for this year's Lancet Countdown. A
'health-related' definition of activities that would be assigned to `category 1' of
the proposed categorisation was used, consisting the activities of the
Healthcare/Health Sector, Disaster Preparedness and Agriculture adaptation
activities from the kMatrix dataset. Although these may be revised in future
research to define the full health-related adaptation definition, it was
determined with a fairly high degree of certainty that there would be very little
that is currently measured in these three sectors that would not be included the
`most direct impacts' category of our categorisation.
Further detail can be found in `Future Form of Indicator' on the future
development of the indicator. A methodology is already under development to
define a full health-related adaptation definition across the entire A&RCC
dataset. Researchers from University College London, kMatrix and the University
of Washington will collaborate on leading a consultation exercise on the creation
of the full health-related adaptation definition in order to provide this as input
to the next iteration of the Lancet Countdown.
Comparison Data
Population and nominal GDP data from 2015 and 2016 from the IMF's World
Economic Outlook (April 2017) were used to estimate 2015/2016 Financial Year
values for population and nominal GDP. Categorization of countries into the
regions defined by the WHO's regional classification was conducted using
metadata from the WHO.
Geographical Coverage

Data

The indicator has global coverage for 226 countries and territories. Data has not
been reported for all 226 countries and territories as the accompanying
comparison data is not available for all, therefore the data reports a subset of
countries for whom adaptation spending data, GDP estimates and population
estimates are available, which totals over 180 countries. Spending data was
available for 226 countries and territories, but due to missing data (principally
population and GDP data) for 46 of these, we report on 180 countries.
Data Sources:
Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change dataset: kMatrix Ltd, in partnership
with University College London
Population and nominal GDP data: IMF World Economic Outlook
Data on national population and GDP for FY 2015-16 were taken from the
90

International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook (April 2017 update)
(www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/01/weodata/index.aspx).

Caveats

Regional classification: World Health Organization
Due to the nature of the methodology, transactions are only measured where
there is an economic `footprint', i.e. where there is transactional/financial data
available to be measured. Therefore, public sector spending with economic
`footprint' (government spending on salaries, for example), cannot be measured.
It also not possible to directly identify what percentage of measured spending is
public versus private. Values are not currently adjusted for inflation. Values of
sales generated are not directly comparable with values derived from national
statistics.
The reference period is financial year 2015/16 (including annual growth in %).
Unfortunately, it was not possible to process all of the historical data to provide
trend data back to 2010/11 in time for the 2017 report deadline, but it is highly
likely that this will be available in the future. This is, however, partly because
significant effort was devoted to extended and updating the definitions of
adaptation activities, which should make for a more comprehensive dataset
(20% of the value in the new dataset represents new activities, so it is a
significant step change).
The `health-related adaptation' measure is based on Health, Agriculture and
Disaster Preparedness for this year's report, but in future years it will also
include health activities from a wider spread of the economy, as well as have
another `tier' of measurement.

Future Form of
Indicator

Given differences in data collection methods between transactional
triangulation and GDP, comparisons as a percentage of GDP should be treated as
indicative. GDP (nominal) data was used and transactional data, in this case, has
not been adjusted for differences in purchasing power parity, and this should be
considered when consulting the data.
There will be three major developments in the future form of the indicator.
The first will be the development of the `three-tier' definition of;
1) adaptation activities with direct, important health impacts
2) those with less direct or more minor health impacts
3) those with no health impact or too tenuous a health impact.
Further details of how this will be developed are available in the `Methods'
section of this appendix.
Secondly, in the future it will possible to present historical data for the indicator
(back to 2010/2011), in order to provide trend data on change in spend over
time. It would also be ideal to provide a comparison of health sector and healthrelated adaptation spend as a percentage of overall transactional spend in the
health sector. As noted above, in future reports it should be possible to include
historical trend data, along with an annual update to the latest available data. It
91

may also be possible within this time frame (2018+), depending on funding, to
develop the full health sector model for measurement as previously discussed.
Finally, in future iterations, it will be possible to provide an indicator of
adaptation spending as a percentage of the overall health sector spend and
health-related spend as a percentage of the entire economy (represented by 24
industries), compiled using transactional data. This should be available within
the next few years.

4.10 Health adaptation funding from global climate financing mechanisms
This indicator used the Climate Funds Update (CFU
http://www.climatefundsupdate.org) 20data on total gross flows of all
multilaterally governed funds focused on climate change since 2003. The data
also includes funds from bilateral organisations, but excludes funding from
bilateral to multinational organisations, to avoid double counting of funds. For
this indicator, the CFU data selected was for adaptation only and the
"approved funding" figure was used to calculate adaptation funding. To
calculate the adaptation funding that has been allocated to health, the
following sectors were selected: "basic health", "health" and "health,
general". Although it is recognised that other adaptation measures can have
important health co-benefits, drawing out how effectively adaptation projects
benefitted and accounted for health is complex and developing a consistent
methodology for doing so would require more resource. Therefore, only those
projects earmarked specifically as health were included in the analysis here.
Climate Funds Update
Some of the data was incomplete and so those adaptation projects that did
not have the year noted could not be included, as it would then not be
possible to accurately show the annual funding for adaptation and health
adaptation, or changes in funding over time. To counter this, project
documents were searched for and, where available, the project approval date
updated in the CFU data. However, this was not possible for all projects.
Furthermore, these results show funding through global climate financing
mechanisms only and do not show the additional funding support given to
these adaptation projects (for example, from UN agencies or national
governments). The funding mechanisms included in the CFU data are shown in
Web Table 1. Climate funding from Canada, the US, Japan and Denmark is not
included in the CFU data; as such the figures presented here are likely to be
underestimates. Additionally, the data presented in Figure 1 is not cumulative.
Although most projects run for more than one year, there was insufficient
information in the CFU data detailing the allocated spending for each project
year and so only the total approved adaptation funding in each given year was
shown.
In future, this indicator could show all funding streams that fund adaptation
generally and health adaptation specifically. The contributions of different
funding streams could then be analysed and new funding streams (such as
national governments) shown.

January 2007 through December 2016.
We assemble the data by accessing archives through the Lexis Nexis, Proquest and

selected through a decision processes involving weighting of four main factors: (1)
geographical diversity (favouring a greater geographical range), (2) circulation

There are some cautions with these findings. With this extensive Boolean string,
there may be some returns that do not centrally address climate change and
health together. For example, the search term "temperature" often generates a
hit, but articles may be addressing a fever related to some illness, rather than
climate change or global warming. As another example, there may be some
overlap between articles discussing climate change legislation and health care
legislation without meaningfully linking climate change and health. Also, in
working with newspapers, rather than, for example, UN
communications/documents, a narrower or more tailored approach might more
effectively reduce the possibilities for false positives in the dataset. However, for
consistency with the other groups and collaborators in the Lancet Countdown
project, we have agreed to carry out the searches with the established terms
above and we therefore are committed to the search results and trends
generated.
In future, more newspaper will be included in the analysis, with improved
representation of different regions. Further details on how health and climate
change is reported on will also be sought, including the demonstration of how
marginal health is to the wider coverage of/debates about climate change. There
will also be an effort to match the newspaper included in 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 to allow
for better comparison and analysis of newspaper reporting on health and climate
change.

5. Public and Political Engagement
5.1. Media coverage of health and climate change
5.1.2. In-depth analysis of newspaper coverage on health and climate change
The analysis used online databases, holding both printed and online versions of Le
Monde and FAZ, and was conducted in two stages. Potential articles related to health
and climate change were captured through an initial search, a more detailed keyword
search within each text then identified articles linking health and climate change. This
second stage also collected information on the framing of health and climate change
(for instance, as an environmental or economic issue), potential policy responses and
co-benefits. The tracking analysis relied on a consistent set of search terms for the
two newspapers, but this may have introduced a linguistic bias. Furthermore, only
two newspapers were analysed, so the findings cannot be used to indicate the
broader nature of newspaper coverage on health and climate change.
The methodology of our analysis is based on and has been developed by the 4CHealth research group, set up by the Centre Virchow-Villerme in Paris and Berlin, to
analyse how the health-climate nexus was addressed in the media. We used a
96

detailed strategy to search the online database of the French newspaper Le Monde
and the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). Specific inclusion
and exclusion criteria were applied in order to capture the most relevant literature in
the timeframe chosen.
The search was conducted in two stages, the first one with broad term aiming to
capture most articles on the subject. The second stage consisted in a keyword search
within text to collect only the articles linking climate change and health.
To filter the valuable articles in the online data bases we have a two-stage-process.
In the first step, we have applied a quantitative approach by choosing keywords
which would specify the topic "climate change and health" in order to exclude the
unrelated articles. Therefore we looked for the most obvious keywords "climate
change" and "health" and climate-change-related as well as health-related keywords.
These keywords have been deductively defined, meaning, while reading the articles
we have noticed the reoccurrence of particular climate-change-related or healthrelated terms, which have then been added to our keyword group. In practice we
have searched for the following keywords in Le Monde and the FAZ (see Table 1).

Table 1 : Keywords and Boolean operator ; stage 1 ; stage 2
As the Table indicates, the first stage keyword search for the FAZ was more
elaborated than the one for Le Monde. This was due to the fact that the online data
base of the FAZ showed only a small number of articles that included "health" as a
health-related term. By adding more health-related keywords to the list, it allowed
us to have a greater total number of relevant articles to progress to the secondstage-process. Articles were only accepted for the second-stage-process if they
included a health-related and a climate-change-related term.
For the second stage of the analysis, a qualitative screening of the articles was
undertaken to categorize them according to a predefined grid.
-

-

Context: This category distinguishes whether the article was about an
international summit (COP, G8, etc.), the publication of a study/scientific
report (IPCC, lancet commission) or an extreme weather event (flooding, heat
waves).
Recommendations: we identified whether the dominant recommendation (if
there was one) was about mitigation, adaptation, or co-benefits.
Tone: we have categorized the tone of the article into four classes: neutral,
positive, mixed and negative.

Articles mentioning health impacts were a small proportion of the total of articles

smaller in FAZ: 67 articles mention the linkages between climate change and health
of 5757.
The climate-health nexus is addressed purely as an environmental issue in France,
while it is more likely to be treated as an economic and/or social issue in Germany
(see box below).

Another difference between Le Monde and FAZ was the solutions that were
recommended to address the health impacts of climate change: while Le Monde
focused on the adaptation strategies to deploy, FAZ put more emphasis on the
mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The co-benefits that public health policies
can represent for mitigation, however, are barely mentioned in either of the papers.

The databases are online databases from Le Monde and the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung. We used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods (see
methods above). Articles were searched in the online search databases using
specific search syntax. Articles were then screened, identified and categorised
according to specified criteria (type of article, studied health impact, geographical
focus, etc).
This analysis considers only a narrow range of search terms, which can induce a
strong linguistic bias. French articles addressing health will almost always mention
the term `sante' (`health' in French), whereas the German equivalent `Gesundheit' is
less often mentioned in articles addressing public health. In order to provide a
similar basis for comparison, we had to use the same protocol to analyse articles in
both Le Monde and FAZ, but we need to be aware that some terms (`health' in
particular) were more frequently used in a language than in the other.
In the future, we aim to compare and contrast our analysis of coverage in Le Monde
and FAZ with other newspapers, such as The Guardian or The New York Times, in
order to account for perspectives of other older industrialised countries, and with
newspapers from developing countries, where the health impacts of climate change
are most marked. Our longer- term goal is a series of international newspapers
analyses. The analysis will include both the global North and the global South.

5. Public and Political Engagement
5.2. Health and climate change in scientific journals
We tracked the use of climate-related terms and their co-occurrence with health terms
using a bibliometric search in both PubMed and Web of Science databases.
The search terms were the following and adapted according to the database:
Climate change related terms
Health related terms
Climate Change
Health
Global warming
Disease
Climate variability
- Non-Communicable
Greenhouse effect
- NCD
GHGE
- Communicable
Epidemiology
Lifestyle

Mental disorders
This list of search terms were found to be exhaustive and appropriate for scientific
databases. A more detailed search syntax, including the diseases of poverty used by
indicator 5.3 was not necessary as with the use of medical subject headings (MeSHTerms) for instance in PubMed those diseases are covered through the MeSH Term
"Communicable diseases". Different search syntaxes were applied and the final number
of overall publications did not show to vary significantly underlining that the search
strategy was robust and able to capture most relevant articles.
Titles and abstracts of identified papers for relevance to the topic were screened three
times. The results were then merged using the Endnote reference manager software and
duplicates removed. Conflicts were resolved within the research team and a final
selection of articles was prepared for analysis. The stepwise process of the selection of
articles is presented in the flow chart below.

102

Numbers indicate the article count retained at each step of the process. With the
applied search terms more than 8000 scientific articles on climate change and health
were identified for the period of 2007-2016. After the screening process only 4% (27 of
2282) were retained and found to be relevant. Indeed, a majority just mentioned
climate change in the abstract and did not focus on the link between climate change and
health. Other articles explored ecological health or animal health but not human health
and were therefore excluded. A minority of papers were excluded as these were book
chapters or conference proceedings referenced in both databases.
After the screening process, data were extracted, categorized and coded to allow for
statistical analysis of the results.
Geographically, the majority of publications address the impact of climate change and
health in Europe and the Americas (Figure S5.1 below). This is particularly concerning
given that countries in the Global South will bear the greatest health burden.

Figure S5.1

103

Figure S5.2 shows the proportion of scientific papers published between 2007 and 2016
per world region. The distribution varied significantly; from 84 for the Eastern
Mediterranean Region to almost 700 articles with a European focus. Indeed, more than
half of identified papers focused on Europe and the Americas. The Eastern
Mediterranean Region was less represented followed by papers focussing on the African
continent.

104

Data

Caveats

Figure S5.2 shows the distribution of publications on health and climate change by the
location of the study (using WHO world regions). For almost all regions, a first peak of
scientific publications is observed in 2008-2009. While some regions showed a
subsequent decline in publications (in 2010-2011), this was not a global trend (the
number of studies focussed on South-East Asia as well as on the Western Pacific Region
was on the rise). Big trends or peaks for regions such as Africa or Eastern
Mediterranean region could not be observed due to their low publication volume.
Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied in order to capture the most
relevant literature. Only peer-reviewed scientific articles on climate change and
population health in English were included. This means that all articles including original
quantitative and qualitative studies, reviews, editorials, viewpoints or comments are
covered in this indicator. Also, no restriction with respect to country or population was
applied. Through the screening process, articles that mentioned climate-related or
health-related terms in titles or abstracts but did not have a specific focus on, or direct
link between, climate change and health were excluded.
This indicator only used two databases, which may be a limitation. However, both
databases are complementary and cover together the majority of the scientific
publications in the area of climate change and human health. Grey literature is not
captured in the indicator and may bias the results. Also the restriction to publications in
English language only may be a caveat. Finally, the quality of identified scientific
publications was not assessed, and analysis was conducted using the title and abstract of
articles due to the restrictions in locating full texts for the large volume of articles
included.
With respect to caveats, the trends identified in scientific engagement (Figure 5.2) may
be influenced by the search terms used in the review. As far as possible, used common
search terms were used across the three indicators in this chapter, enabling comparisons
to be drawn across engagement in health and climate change in the media, the scientific
community and in the political sphere. Furthermore, the review was restricted to
English-language journals.
Other caveats for this indicator include the narrow range of search terms, which
excludes reference to many of indirect links between health and climate change. Several

UNGD statements in the dataset refer to such indirect connections, such as effects of
climate change on water and agriculture, but these are not included. Therefore, the
results present a conservative estimate of high-level political engagement with the
intersecting issues of health and climate change. Future Lancet Countdown reports will
consider political engagement with these indirect links, as well as providing additional
forms of analysis. For the regional analysis (Figure 5.4), note should be taken of variation
in the number of countries per region.
The indicator aims to provide an overview of existing scientific publications in the area of
climate change and health. For the 2017 report, it provides an overview of trends across
the last decade. Going forward, it will monitor future trends.
The search syntax can be used each year to track the number of scientific articles on
climate change and health. In the future, each identified scientific publication will be
categorized according to different criteria (geographical focus, type of article, health
outcome, type of climate change measurement, etc.) in order to provide a more in depth
analysis of research trends and foci. Other dimensions, such as the country location and
institutional affiliation of authors, cross-country collaboration and citations could also be
analysed.

5. Public and Political Engagement
5.3. Health and climate change in the United Nations General Assembly
The dataset on UNGD statements used contains all country speeches made in the
UNGD between 1970 and 2016. Here, the frequency of references to health and
climate change in annual UNGD statements was considered between 2007 and
2016. Overall, 1,928 high level statements were examined. The keywords used are
based on a) health-related terms and b) climate change-related terms.
The search terms for (a) heath are:
"malaria", "diarrhoea", "infection", "disease", "pneumonia", "epidemic",
"pandemic", "public_health", "health_care", "epidemiology", "healthcare",
"health", "mortality", "morbidity", "nutrition", "illness", "infectious", "ncd",
"non-communicable_disease", "noncommunicable_disease",
"communicable_disease", "air_pollution", "nutrition", "malnutrition",
"mental_disorder", "stunting".

The search terms for (b) climate change are:
"climate_change", "global_warming", "green_house", "temperature",
"extreme_weather", "global_environmental_change", "climate_variability",
"greenhouse", "low_carbon", "ghge", "renewable_energy",
"carbon_emission", "co2_emission", "climate_pollutant".

In order to produce an indicator of engagement with the intersection of climate
106

change and health, we focused on whether any of the health related terms
appeared immediately before or after any climate change terms in the GD
statements. This was based on a search of the 10 words before and after a
reference to a climate change related term.
Data

To produce this indicator, we draw on a new dataset of GD statements: the United
Nations General Debate corpus, in which the annual GD statements have been preprocessed and prepared for use in quantitative text analysis. 4 The dataset contains
all of the country speeches made in the UN General Debate between 1970 and
2016.

Caveats

This analysis here is based on a narrow range of search terms, which excludes
reference to many of indirect links between climate change and health. A number
of GD statements in this time period refer to such indirect connections, such as the
effects of climate change on water and agriculture - however, these are not
included here. Therefore, the results present a somewhat conservative estimate of
high level political engagement with the intersection of climate change and health.
Future work in this area will consider engagement with these indirect links, as well
as providing additional forms of analysis.

Future
Form of
Indicator

In the future, we plan on looking more closely at the references to indirect links
between climate change and health. For example, what are the main ways in which
governments view climate change impacting on health? We will consider whether
this changes over time based on awareness of the multiple ways in which climate
change and health are connected.
We will also look to expand this indicator by considering private sector engagement
with climate change and health. Specifically, for next iteration of the indicator we
will examine annual corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports
("Triple Bottom Line Reports") of major international corporations. Using these
report, we will perform similar searches (engagement with health, climate change,
and intersection of the two) based on these reports.

Additional
Results

We present some additional findings and breakdowns in this section.
Figure S5.3 below shows the level of political engagement with climate change and
health separately, rather than engagement with the intersection of climate change
and health. Again, this is measured by the references to the key search terms
associated with climate change and health in General Debate speeches. The figure
shows that in general there is a higher level of engagement with climate change
than health. It also shows a decline in engagement with climate change in the
General Debate following COP 15 in Copenhagen in 2009. However, in recent years
this has increased around the Paris Agreement. Engagement with health has
generally been quite low in the General Debate. However, there is a large increase
in the salience of global health from 2012 onwards, which coincides with the
transition from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the Sustainable

Figure S5.4 above displays a word cloud of terms linked to the intersection of
climate change and health. In other words, it shows the main topics that are raised
in GD statements (2007-2016) when governments discuss the linkages between
climate change and health. The figure shows that in addition to topics that are
directly linked to climate change and health, issues such as food, global disasters,
poverty, and security are also referred to. The word cloud also shows that
Copenhagen and Paris were key issues raised in the discussions of the intersection
of climate change and health between 2007 and 2016.
Figure S5.5 below displays a word cloud for health. In other words, it shows the
topics that governments refer to in General Debate statements when discussing
health. It is important to note that climate change features as a prominent topic.
Therefore, this suggests that when discussing health in the General Debate,
governments tend to emphasise the role of climate change.

Figure S5.6 below shows a word cloud for climate change. It is worth noting that
`health' does not feature, suggesting that when governments discuss climate
change in the General Debate, they tend to emphasize other issues, such as security
and development, much more than specifically referring to the health implications
of climate change.

110

There references to the linkages between climate change and health in the GD
statements tend to vary considerably. For example, Denmark's address in 2014
made a more general reference to "...climate change causing great risks to human
health, global food security and economic development..." Other statements focus
on more specific linkages. For example, Angola's statement in 2016 highlights the
importance of the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and links greenhouse
gas emissions and climate change to "...the deterioration and shortening of cycles of
drought and heavy rainfall, which pose a risk to agriculture...", and goes on to state
that "...such effects also increase the incidence of various epidemic diseases".

Background

Public and political engagement
Engagement with health and climate change in corporate social
responsibility and sustainability reports
In order to produce a measure of corporate engagement with the
intersection of climate change and health using corporate social
responsibility (CSR) and sustainability reports of major public
international companies. We will focus on whether any key health
related terms appeared immediately before or after any key climate
change terms in the CSR and sustainability reports. This is based on a
search of the 10 words before and after a reference to a climate
change related term.
To produce this indicator, we will collect the CSR and sustainability
reports that cover economic, environmental, social, and governance
performance of major public international companies. These reports
are designed to show internal and external stakeholders
organisational commitment to sustainable development. As a primary
data source we will focus on the collection of reports available
through the United Nations Global Compact. 5 Corporations that sign
up to the UN Global Compact have to report annually on their
progress on the various principles of the Global Compact, which
include a strong focus on environmental and social responsibility. The
aim of these reports is to create greater accountability by enabling
stakeholders to judge the performance of corporations that have
signed up. Therefore, these reports provide an important source of
information on how corporations on the extent to which corporations
engage with the linkages between climate change and health.
Furthermore, these reports are comparable across corporations from
a wide range of developed and developing countries, as well as from
different sectors. 6
The degree of data coverage is unclear and likely to be slightly
uneven given voluntary nature of producing such reports and making
them publicly available.
Public and political engagement
Inclusion of health and climate change within medical and public
health curricula
Health professionals have a key role in promoting climate change and
health to the public and politics. As a trusted and respected
knowledge source, health professionals can advocate these issues to
their patients and help building community resilience (1, 2). They can
use their unique health expertise and community understanding to
effectively influence environmental policy (1, 3, 4). The WHO Second
Global Conference Health & Climate thus called for health
professionals to take on a role of leadership and advocacy on these

issues (4). Yet, several studies report that they are impeded by a lack
of education on these topics (5, 6). The inclusion of health & climate
change in health professionals training is therefore essential. This
proposed indicator will aim at describing the state of health & climate
change education within medical and public health curricula.
The scope of the proposed indicator is limited to medical education
before specialization, and to master degree programs of public,
global, or international health. The data are collected through a
survey questionnaire, informed by a literature review and advice
from selected experts. The questions concern the inclusion of courses
on climate change, their design and their integration in the
curriculum. The results are analysed using descriptive statistics. The
analysis will include a regional comparison using the WHO region
grouping.
The survey used to collect data was sent to the member institutions
of three international networks: the M8 alliance, the World
Federation of Academic Institutions for Global Health (WFAIGH) and
the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME). Responses from
11 public health master degree programs and 25 medical schools are
already available.
* The already available responses may not be representative of the
global state of climate change and health education worldwide:
they represent a small number of programs, from 4 of the 6 WHO
regions, and several from the same country.
* The proposed indicator is limited to medical schools and public /
global / international health masters. Ideally, it should reflect the
climate change & health education of all health professionals.
* Given the slow rate to which curricula change, it may not be
relevant to update this proposed indicator each year.
