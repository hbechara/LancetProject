The report represents the \n\xcb\x9cndings and consensus of 35 leading academic insti-\ntutions and UN agencies from every continent. Each \nyear, the methods and data that underpin the \nLancet Countdown\xe2\x84\xa2s indicators are further developed and \n\nimproved, with updates described at each stage of this \n\nreport. The collaboration draws on the world-class expertise of climate scientists; ecologists; mathemati-\ncians; engineers; energy, food, and transport experts; \n\neconomists; social and political scientists; public health \nprofessionals; and doctors, to generate the quality and \n\ndiversity of data required.The science of climate change describes a range of \npossible futures, which are largely dependent on the \n\ndegree of action or inaction in the face of a warming \n\nworld. The policies implemented will have far-reaching \ne\xcb\x9aects in determining these eventualities, with the indicators tracked here monitoring both the present-day \ne\xcb\x9aects of climate change, as well as the worldwide response. Understanding these decisions as a choice \n\nbetween one of two pathways\xc5\xa0one that continues with \n\nthe business as usual response and one that redirects to a \n\nfuture that remains \xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x80\x9awell below 2\xc2\xb0C\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x84\xa2\xc5\xa0helps to bring the \n\nimportance of recognising the e\xcb\x9aects of climate change \n\nand the necessary response to the forefront.Evidence provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change, the International Energy Agency, and \n\nthe US National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n\nclari\xcb\x9ces the degree and magnitude of climate change \n\nexperienced today and contextualises these two pathways.The impacts of climate change on human health\nThe world has observed a 1\xc2\xb0C temperature rise above \n\npre-industrial levels, with feedback cycles and polar \nampli\xcb\x9ccation resulting in a rise as high as 3\xc2\xb0C in north \nwestern Canada.\n1,2 Eight of the ten hottest years on record \nhave occurred in the past decade.3 Such rapid change \nis primarily driven by the combustion of fossil fuels, \n\nconsumed at a rate of 171 000 kg of coal, 116 000 000 L of \ngas, and 186 000 L of oil per s.4\xc5\x926 Progress in mitigating this \nthreat is intermittent at best, with carbon dioxide \n\nemissions continuing to rise in 2018.\n7 Importantly, many \nof the indicators contained in this report suggest the world \n\nis following this \xef\xac\x81business as usual\xef\xac\x82 pathway.\nThe carbon intensity of the energy system has remained \nunchanged since 1990 (indicator 3.1.1), and from 2016 to \n\n2018, total primary energy supply from coal increased \n\nby 1\xc2\xb77%, reversing a previously recorded downward trend \n\n(indicator 3.1.2). Correspondingly, the health\n-care sector is \nresponsible for about 4\xc2\xb76% of global emissions, a value \nwhich is steadily rising across most major eco nomies \n(indicator 3.6). Global fossil fuel consumption subsidies \n\nincreased by 50% over the past 3 years, reaching a peak of almost US$430 billion in 2018 (indicator 4.4.1).A child born today will experience a world that is more \nthan four degrees warmer than the pre-industrial average, \nwith climate change impacting human health from infancy and adolescence to adulthood and old age. Across \n\nthe world, children are among the worst a\xcb\x9aected by \n\nclimate change. Downward trends in global yield poten-\ntial for all major crops tracked since 1960 threaten \n\nfood production and food security, with infants often the \n\nworst a\xcb\x9aected by the potentially permanent e\xcb\x9aects of \n\nundernutrition (indicator 1.5.1). Children are among the \n\nmost susceptible to diarrhoeal disease and experience the \n\nmost severe e\xcb\x9aects of dengue fever. Trends in climate \n\nsuitability for disease transmission are particularly \n\nconcerning, with nine of the ten most suitable years for \n\nthe transmission of dengue fever on record occurring \n\nsince 2000 (indicator 1.4.1). Similarly, since an early \n\n1980s baseline, the number of days suitable for \nVibrio\n (a pathogen responsible for part of the burden of \n\ndiarrhoeal disease) has doubled, and global suitability \nLancet \n2019; 394: 1836\xc5\x9278Published Online November 13, 2019 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32596-6See Editorial page 1780*Co-chairsInstitute for Global Health\n (N Watts MA, Prof I Kelman PhD, \nA McGushin MSc), Institute for Sustainable Resources\n (C Dalin PhD, P Drummond MSc, \nProf P Ekins PhD), Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (Prof M Davies PhD, \nJ Taylor PhD)\n, Department of Geography (L Georgeson PhD, \nProf M Maslin PhD), Energy Institute (I Hamilton PhD, \nProf T Oreszczyn PhD, \nS Pye PhD)\n, Institute for Human Health and Performance\n (Prof H Montgomery MD), and Office of the Vice Provost \nfor Research\n (Prof A Costello FMedSci)\n, University College London, \nLondon, UK; Center on Global \nEnergy Policy School of \nInternational and Public Affairs, Columbia University, \nNew York City, NY, USA \n(M Lott PhD); Air Quality and \nGreenhouse Gases Programme, \nInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, \nLaxenburg, Austria \n(M Amann PhD, \nG Kiesewetter PhD)\n; Department of Meteorology\n (Prof N W Arnell PhD) \nand School of Agriculture, Policy, \nand Development\n (Prof E Robinson PhD) \nUniversity of Reading, Reading, \nUK; Brighton and Sussex Medical School (S Ayeb-Karlsson PhD)\n and School of Global Studies \n(Prof D Kniveton PhD)\n, University of Sussex, Brighton, \nwww.thelancet.com \n  Vol 394   November 16, 2019\n   1837UK; Centre on Climate Change \nand Planetary Health \n(K Belesova PhD, R Lowe PhD) \n\nand Department of Public \n\nHealth, Environments, \nand Society (J Milner PhD, \n\nProf P Wilkinson FRCP)\n, London \nSchool of Hygiene & Tropical \n\nMedicine, London, UK; \n\nCooperative Institute for \n\nResearch in Environmental \n\nSciences and Environmental \nStudies (Prof M Boykoff PhD) \n\nand Center for Science and \n\nTechnology Policy Research\n \n(O Pearman MEM) \nUniversity of \n\nColorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, \n\nUSA; Department of Public \n\nHealth and Clinical Medicine \n\n(M O Sewe PhD, \n\nProf J Rockl\xc3\xb6v PhD) \nand \nDepartment of Epidemiology \n\nand Global Health\n \n(Prof P Byass PhD, \n\nM Nilsson PhD), Ume\xc3\xa5 \nUniversity, Ume\xc3\xa5, Sweden; \n\nDepartment of Earth System \n\nScience, Tsinghua University, \n\nBeijing, China (Prof W Cai PhD, \nProf P Gong PhD)\n; Department \nof Public Health and the \n\nEnvironment \n(D Campbell-Lendrum DPhil, \n\nT Neville MSc) and Global \nMalaria Programme \n(L Fernandez Montoya MSc)\n, \nWHO, Geneva, Switzerland;\n \nSchool of Psychology, Cardiff \n\nUniversity, Cardiff, UK\n \n(S Capstick PhD, P Haggar PhD)\n; \nInstitute for Environmental \nSciences, University of Geneva, \n\nGeneva, Switzerland \n(J Chambers PhD)\n; Department \nof Environmental Studies, \nUniversity of New England, \n\nBiddeford, ME, USA \n\n(M Daly PhD); School of \n\nGovernment, University of \n\nBirmingham, Birmingham, UK\n \n(N Dasandi PhD); Yale Climate \n\nChange and Health Initiative \n\n(Prof R Dubrow PhD) and \nDepartment of Anesthesiology\n \n(J Sherman MD)\n; Yale University, \n\nNew Haven, CT, USA; \n\nDepartment of Global Health \n\n(Prof K L Ebi PhD) and Centre for \n\nHealth and the Global \n\nEnvironment (J Hess PhD)\n; \nUniversity of Washington, \n\nWashington, DC, USA; \n\nDepartment of Civil and \n\nEnvironmental Engineering, \nNortheastern University, \n\nBoston, MA, USA \n\n(M Eckelman PhD)\n; Department \nof Fish and Wildlife \n\nConservation, Virginia \nPolytechnic Institute and State \n\nUniversity, Blacksburg, VA, USA\n for coastal Vibrio cholerae\n has increased by 9\xc2\xb79% \n(indicator 1.4.1).Through adolescence and beyond, air pollution\xc5\xa0principally driven by fossil fuels, and exacerbated by \n\nclimate change\xc5\xa0damages the heart, lungs, and every \n\nother vital organ. These e\xcb\x9aects accumulate over time, \n\nand into adulthood, with global deaths attributable to \n\nambient \xcb\x9cne particulate matter (PM2\xc2\xb75) remaining at \n2\xc2\xb79 million in 2016 (indicator 3.3.2) and total global air \n\npollution deaths reaching 7 million.8Later in life, families and livelihoods are put at risk \nfrom increases in the frequency and severity of extreme \n\nweather conditions, with women among the most \n\nvulnerable across a range of social and cultural contexts. \n\nGlobally, 77% of countries experienced an increase in \n\ndaily population exposure to wild\xcb\x9cres from 2001\xc5\x9214 to \n\n2015\xc5\x9218 (indicator 1.2.1). India and China sustained the \n\nlargest increases, with an increase of over 21 million \n\nexposures in India and 17 million exposures in China \n\nover this time period. In low-income countries, almost \nall economic losses from extreme weather events are uninsured, placing a particularly high burden on \n\nindividuals and households (indicator 4.1). Temperature \n\nrise and heatwaves are increasingly limiting the labour \n\ncapacity of various populations. In 2018, 133\xc2\xb76 billion \n\npotential work hours were lost globally, 45 billion more \n\nthan the 2000 baseline, and southern areas of the USA \n\nlost 15\xc5\x9220% of potential daylight work hours during the \n\nhottest month of 2018 (indicator 1.1.4).Populations aged 65 years and older are particularly \nvulnerable to the health e\xcb\x9aects of climate change, and \n\nespecially to extremes of heat. From 1990 to 2018, \n\npopulations in every region have become more vul-\n\nnerable to heat and heatwaves, with Europe and the \n\nEastern Mediterranean remaining the most vulnerable \n\n(indicator 1.1.1). In 2018, these vulnerable popu lations \nexperienced 220 million \nheatwave exposures globally, \nbreaking the previous record of 209 million set in 2015 \n\n(indicator 1.1.3). Already faced with the challenge of an \n\nageing population, Japan had 32 million heat\n wave \nexposures a\xcb\x9aecting people aged 65 years and older in 2018, \n\nthe equivalent of almost every person in this age group \nexperiencing a heatwave. Finally, although di\xcb\x9bcult to \n\nquantify, the downstream\n risks of climate change, such as \nmigration, poverty exacerbation, violent con\xcb\x9dict, and \n\nmental illness, a\xcb\x9aect people of all ages and all nationalities.A business as usual trajectory will result in a funda-mentally altered world, with the indicators described \n\nproviding a glimpse of the implications of this pathway. \n\nThe life of every child born today will be profoundly \n\na\xcb\x9aected by climate change. Without accelerated inter-\n\nvention, this new era will come to de\xcb\x9cne the health of \n\npeople at every stage of their lives.Responding to climate change for health\nThe Paris Agreement has set a target of \xef\xac\x81holding the \n\nincrease in the global average temperature to well below \n2\xc2\xb0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing e\xcb\x9aorts to \nlimit the temperature increase to 1\xc2\xb75\xc2\xb0C.\xef\xac\x82 In a world that matches this ambition, a child born today would see the \n\nphase-out of all coal in the UK and Canada by their sixth\n and 11th birthday; they would see France ban the sale of \n\npetrol and diesel cars by their 21st birthday; and they would \n\nbe 31 years old by the time the world reaches net-zero in \n2050, with the UK\xe2\x84\xa2s recent commitment to reach this goal one of many to come. The changes seen in this alternate \n\npathway could result in cleaner air, safer cities, and more \n\nnutritious food, coupled with renewed investment in \n\nhealth systems and vital infrastructure. This second path\xc5\xa0\nwhich limits the global average temperature rise to \xef\xac\x81well \n\nbelow 2\xc2\xb0C\xef\xac\x82\xc5\xa0is possible, and would transform the health \n\nof a child born today for the better, right the way through \n\ntheir life.Considering the evidence available in the 2019 indicators, \nsuch a transition could be beginning to unfold. Despite a \n\nsmall increase in coal use in 2018, in key countries such as \n\nChina, it continued to decrease as a share of electricity \n\ngeneration (indicator 3.1.2). Correspondingly, renewables \n\naccounted for 45% of global growth in power generation \n\ncapacity that year, and low\n-carbon electricity reached a \nhigh of 32% of global electricity in 2016 (indicator 3.1.3). \nGlobal per capita use of electric vehicles increased by \n\n20\xc2\xb76% between 2015 and 2016, and now represents \n\n1\xc2\xb78% of China\xe2\x84\xa2s total transportation fuel use (indicator 3.4). \n\nImprovements in air pollution seen in Europe from 2015 \n\nto 2016, could result in a reduction of Years of Life Lost  \n\n(YLL) worth \xe2\x80\xa25\xc2\xb72 billion annually, if this reduction \n\nremained constant across a lifetime (indicator 4.2). In \n\nseveral cases, the economic savings from a healthier and \n\nmore productive workforce, with fewer health-care \nexpenses, will cover the initial investment costs of these interventions. Similarly, cities and health systems are \n\nbecoming more resilient to the e\xcb\x9aects of climate change; \n\nabout 50% of countries and 69% of cities surveyed reported \n\ne\xcb\x9aorts to conduct national health adaptation plans or \n\nclimate change risk asses\n sments (indicators 2.1.1, \n2.1.2, \nand 2.1.3). These plans are now being implemented, with \n\nthe number of countries providing climate services to the \n\nhealth sector increasing from 55 in 2018 to 70 in 2019 \n\n(indicator 2.2) and 109 countries reporting medium to \n\nhigh implementation of a national health emergency \n\nframe work (indicator 2.3.1). Growing demand is coupled \nwith a steady increase in health adaptation spending, \nwhich represents 5% (\xc2\xa313 billion) of total adaptation \n\nfunding in 2018 and has increased by 11\xc2\xb78% over the past \n\n12 months (indicator 2.4). This increase is in part funded \n\nby growing revenues from carbon pricing mechanisms, \n\nwith a 30% increase to US$43 billion in funds raised \n\nbetween 2017 and 2018 (indicator 4.4.3).However, current progress is inadequate, and despite the \nbeginnings of the transition described, the indicators \n\npublished in the Lancet Countdown\xe2\x84\xa2s 2019 report are \nsuggestive of a world struggling to cope with warming that \n\nis occurring faster than governments are able, or willing to \n1838 www.thelancet.com \n  Vol 394   November 16, 2019\n  (L E Escobar PhD); Department of Health Sciences, University \nof York, York, UK \n(Prof H Graham PhD)\n; The Integrated Development, \nHealth and Environment Unit, \nUniversidad Peruana Cayetano \nHeredia, Lima, Peru \n(S Hartinger PhD); Health and Environment International Trust, Nelson, New Zealand\n (Prof T Kjellstrom PhD)\n; Nelson \nMarlborough Institute of \nTechnology, Nelson, \nNew Zealand (B Lemke PhD)\n; Rollins School of Public Health, \nEmory University, Atlanta, GA, \nUSA (Prof Y Liu PhD)\n; The Centre \nfor Environment, Fisheries and \nAquaculture Science, Dorset, UK \n(Prof J Martinez-Urtaza PhD)\n; History and Society Division, \nBabson College, Wellesley, MA, \nUSA (L McAllister PhD); Data \nScience Lab, Hertie School, \nBerlin, Germany \n(Prof S Jankin Mikhaylov PhD, \nProf S Munzert PhD); Preventive \nMedicine and Public Health \nResearch Center, Iran University \nof Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran\n (Prof M Moradi-Lakeh MD)\n; European Centre for \nEnvironment and Human \nHealth (K Morrissey PhD) and \nMedical School (D Pencheon BM) \nUniversity of Exeter, Exeter, UK; \nFaculty of Medicine, School of \nPublic Health, Imperial College \nLondon, London, UK \n(K Murray PhD)\n; Iranian Fisheries \nScience Research Institute, \nAgricultural Research, \nEducation, and Extension \nOrganisation, Tehran, Iran \n(F Owfi PhD, M Rabbaniha PhD)\n; School of Medicine, Griffith \nUniversity, Brisbane, QLD, \nAustralia \n(D Phung PhD); School \nof Biological Sciences, \nUniversity of Aberdeen, \nAberdeen, UK (R Quinn PhD)\n; Scientific Assessment Section, \nEuropean Centre for Disease \nPrevention and Control, Solna, \nSweden \n(Prof J C Semenza PhD)\n; WHO-WMO Joint Climate and \nHealth Office, Geneva, \nSwitzerland (J Shumake-Guillemot DrPh)\n; Faculty of Plantation and \nAgrotechnology, Universiti \nTeknologi MARA, Shah Alam, \nMalaysia \n(M Tabatabaei PhD)\n; and Physical Oceanography \nDivision, Atlantic \nOceanographic and \nMeteorological Laboratory, \nNational Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, \nMiami, FL, USA\n (J Trinanes PhD)\nrespond. Opportunities are being missed, with the Green \nClimate Fund yet to receive projects speci\xcb\x9ccally focused on \n\nimproving climate-related public health, despite the fact \nthat in other forums, leaders of small island developing states are recognising the links between health and climate \n\nchange (indicator 5.3). In response, the generation that \n\nwill be most a\xcb\x9aected by climate change has led a wave of \n\nschool strikes across the world.Bold new approaches to policy making, research, and \nbusiness are needed in order to change course. An \n\nunprecedented challenge demands an unprecedented \n\nresponse, and it will take the work of the 7\xc2\xb75 billion people \n\ncurrently alive to ensure that the health of a child born \n\ntoday is not de\xcb\x9cned by a changing climate.IntroductionHuman wellbeing, and the stability of local communities, \n\nhealth systems, and governments, all depend on how they \n\ninterface with the changing global climate.9,10 Across \nthe world, an average temperature increase of 1\xc2\xb0C from a \n\npre-industrial baseline1,2 has already resulted in extreme \nclimatic and environmental changes, with severe storms \n\nand \xcb\x9doods, prolonged heatwaves and droughts, new \n\nand emerging infectious diseases,11\xc5\x9213 and compounding \nthreats to food security. Left unabated, climate change will \n\nde\xcb\x9cne the health pro\xcb\x9cle of current and future generations, \n\nwill challenge already overwhelmed health systems, and \n\nundermine progress towards the UN Sustainable \n\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) and universal health coverage \n\n(UHC).14,15The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC)\xe2\x84\xa2s 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1\xc2\xb75\xc2\xb0C \n\nemphasises the scale of the response required: global \n\nannual emissions must halve by 2030 and reach net-zero \nby 2050 to limit warming to 1\xc2\xb75\xc2\xb0C, while recognising that no amount of climate change is considered safe.2 Placing \nhealth at the centre of this transition will yield enormous \n\ndividends for the public and the economy, with cleaner \n\nair, safer cities, and healthier diets. Analysis focused on \n\none of these path ways\xc5\xa0cleaner air through more \nsustainable transport and power generation systems\xc5\xa0\nsuggests that the economic gains from the health bene\xcb\x9cts \n\nof meeting the Paris Agreement substantially outweigh \nthe cost of any intervention by a ratio of 1\xc2\xb745 to 2\xc2\xb745, \n\nresulting in trillions of dollars of savings worldwide.16 When the health bene\xcb\x9cts of any increase in physical \n\nactivity that results from modal shift are taken into \n\naccount, the economic gains increase signi\xcb\x9ccantly.\n17 These analyses complement an assessment from outside \n\nthe health sector, which estimates that a robust response \n\nto climate change could yield more than US$26 trillion \n\nand 65 million new low-carbon jobs by 2030, compared \nwith a business as usual scenario.18Monitoring this transition from threat to opportunity \nand demonstrating the bene\xcb\x9cts of realising the Paris \n\nAgreement is precisely why the Lancet Countdown on \n\nhealth and climate change was formed. As an international, \nindependent research collaboration, the partner ship \nbrings together 35 academic institutions and UN agencies \n\nfrom every continent. The indicators and report presented here represent the work and consensus of climate \n\nscientists; geographers; engineers; energy, food and \n\ntransport experts; economists; social and political \n\nscientists; public health professionals; and doctors.The 41 indicators of the 2019 report span \xcb\x9cve domains: \nclimate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; \n\nadaptation planning and resilience for health; mitigation \n\nactions and their health co-bene\xcb\x9cts; economics and \n\xcb\x9cnance; and public and political engagement (panel 1).Strengthening a global monitoring system for health and \nclimate changeThis collaboration builds on three decades of work around the world, which has sought to understand and \nassess the scienti\xcb\x9cc pathways that link climate change to \n\npublic health.13 In 2016, The Lancet Countdown launched \na global consultation process, actively seeking input from \nexperts and policy makers on which aspects of these \npathways could and should be tracked as part of a global \nmonitoring process. A large number of indicators were \ninitially considered, and then narrowed down into the \n\xcb\x9cve indicator domains and published, along with a \n\nrequest for further input.19 The \xcb\x9cnal set of indicators were selected on the basis of the presence of credible \nscienti\xcb\x9cc links to climate change and to public health; \nthe presence of reliable and regularly updated data, \navailable across temporal and geographic scales; and the \nimportance of this information to policy makers.20Overcoming the data and capacity limitations inherent \nin this \xcb\x9celd, and remaining adaptable to a rapidly evolving \n\nscienti\xcb\x9cc landscape has required a commitment to an \n\nopen and iterative approach. This has meant that the \n\nanalysis provided in each subsequent annual report \n\nreplaces analyses from previous years, with methods and \n\ndatasets being continuously improved and updated. In \n\nevery case, a full description of these changes is provided \n\nin the appendix, which is intended as an essential \n\ncompanion to the main report, rather than a more \n\ntraditional addendum.The 2019 report presents 12 months of work re\xcb\x9cning the \nmetrics and analysis. In addition to updating each indicator \n\nwith the information collated over the course of 1 year, \n\nthree key developments have occurred.Firstly, methodologies and datasets have been strength-\nened for indicators that capture heat and heatwaves; \n\nlabour capacity loss; the lethality of weather\n-related \ndisasters; terrestrial food security and under nutrition; \nhealth adap tation planning and vulnerability asses sments; \nair pollution mortality in cities; household fuel use for \n\ncooking; and qualitative validation of engage\n ment from \nthe media and national governments in health and climate \nchange.Secondly, the geographical and temporal coverage has \nbeen expanded for indicators that capture marine food \nwww.thelancet.com \n  Vol 394   November 16, 2019\n   1839security; national adaptation planning for health; health \nvulnerability assessments; climate information services for \n\nhealth; the carbon intensity of the energy system; access to \n\nclean energy; and Chinese media engagement in health \n\nand climate change.Finally, new indicators were constructed that capture \nexposure to wild\xcb\x9cres; the transmission suitability for \nV cholerae; the bene\xcb\x9cts and harms of air conditioning; \n\nemissions from livestock and crop production; global \nhealth-care system emissions; economic cost of air pollution; and individual online engagement in health \nand climate change.Ongoing research aims to establish indicators for \nconcepts that are inherently di\xcb\x9bcult to quantify, such \nas the mental health e\xcb\x9aects of climate change. Three \n\nindicators included in previous years\xc5\xa0covering migra-\ntion, global health adaptation funding, and academic \nengagement in health and climate change\xc5\xa0are not \n\npresented in the 2019 report, as further work is being done \n\nto improve their methods and to ensure that they are able \n\nto be sustainably reproduced in the future.

Over 220 million additional exposures to \n\nheatwaves (with each exposure de\xcb\x9cned as one person aged \n\n65 years or older exposed to one heatwave) occurred in \n\n2018, compared with a 1986\xc5\x922005 climatological baseline, \n\nhigher than ever previously tracked (indicator 1.1.3). This \n\noccurred at a time when demo\n graphic vulnerability to \nthese extremes continued to increase across every region (indicator 1.1.1), and the warming experienced by \n\nhuman populations reached four times that of the global \n\naverage temperature rise (indicator 1.1.2). Around the \n\nworld, resultant losses in labour capacity were reported, \n\nwith several southern states in the USA losing as much \n\nas 15\xc5\x9220% of daylight capacity (for workers in construc-\n\ntion and agriculture; indicator 1.1.4). The e\xcb\x9aects of this \n\nwarming extended to other extremes, with 152 countries \n\nexperiencing a marked increase in the daily popu-\nlation exposures to wild\xcb\x9cres compared with baseline \n\n(indicator 1.2.1). Regarding infectious diseases, 2018 was \n\nranked second on record as having the most suitable \n\nconditions for the transmission of diarrhoeal disease and \n\nwound infections from Vibrio\n bacteria, and 9 of the past \n\n10 most suitable years for the transmission of dengue fever \n\nhave occurred since 2000 (indicator 1.4.1). The distribution \n\nof exposure and e\xcb\x9aect is not equal, with several indicators \n\nreporting greater changes in low-income settings than in \nhigh-income settings\xc5\xa0for example, in parts of Africa, \nSouth-East Asia, and the Western P\naci\xcb\x9cc (indicator 4.1).Despite these worsening e\xcb\x9aects, the carbon intensity of \nthe global energy system has remained \xcb\x9dat since 1990 \n\n(indicator 3.1.1) and use of clean fuels for household \n\nservices is stagnating (indicator 3.2). Perhaps of greatest \n\nconcern is that total primary energy supply from coal \n\nincreased by 1\xc2\xb77% from 2016 to 2018, reversing a previously \n\nobserved downward trend (indicator 3.1.2), and carbon \n\ndioxide (CO2) emissions from the energy sector, far from \nfalling, rose by 2\xc2\xb76% from 2016 to 2018 (indicator 3.1.1). \n\nGlobal fossil fuel subsidies rose to US$427 billion in \n\n2018\xc5\xa0a 33% rise from 2017 (indicator 4.4.1)\xc5\xa0and emis-\nsions associated with health care now represent 4\xc2\xb76% of \n\nglobal emissions, rising across most major economies \n\n(indicator 3.6). Fossil fuel use continues to contribute to \n\nambient air pollution, which resulted in 2\xc2\xb79 million \n\npremature deaths globally in 2016 (indicator 3.3.2).Although these emerging health impacts and the lack \nof a coordinated global response portray a bleak picture, \n\nthey also mask important promising trends. Several \n\nencouraging trends continue, such as reductions in \n\ninvestment in new coal capacity and a fall in coal as a share \n\nof total electricity generation (indicators 4.3.1 and 3.1.2). \n\nRenewable energy accounted for 45% of total growth in \n\n2018 (indicator 3.1.3), and low-carbon electricity repre-sented an impressive 32% share of total global electricity \n\ngeneration in 2016 (indicator 3.1.3). The reduction in air \npollution recorded in Europe from 2015 to 2016, if \n\nmaintained across a lifetime, could result in an annual \nreduction in YLL valued at \xe2\x80\xa25\xc2\xb72 billion (indicator 4.2). \n\nThese changes are reinforced by new commitments from \n\nthe UK21 and France\n22 to reach net zero by 2050, with other \ncountries soon expected to follow.\nNotably, the world is beginning to adapt, with 50% of \ncountries and 69% of cities surveyed reporting the \n\ncompletion or undertaking of a climate change risk \n\nassessment or adaptation plan (indicators 2.1.2 and 2.1.3). \n\nIncreasingly, these plans are being implemented, with \n\n70 countries providing meteorological services targeted \n\ntowards the health sector in 2019 and 109 countries \n\nachieving medium to high implementation of a national \n\nhealth emergency framework (indicators 2.2 and 2.3.1).In the health sector, the UK\xe2\x84\xa2s Royal College of General \nPractitioners and Faculty of Public Health divested \n\ntheir fossil fuel investments in 2018, joining many uni-\nversities, non-governmental organisations, and pension \nfunds from across the world (indicator 4.3.4). Alongside this, new analysis suggests a growing and more \n\nsophisticated recognition of the health bene\xcb\x9cts of the \n\nresponse to climate change in the media (indicator 5.1).Many of the trends identi\xcb\x9ced in the 2019 \nLancet Countdown report are deeply concerning. Greenhouse\n-gas emissions continue to rise. Nevertheless, the \n\ncontinued expansion of renewable energy, increased \ninvestment in health system adaptation, improvements in \n\nsustainable transport, and growth in public engage ment \nsuggests ongoing reasons for cautious optimism. At a\n time when the UN Framework Convention on Climate \n\nChange is preparing to review commitments under the \n\nParis Agreement in 2020, accelerated ambition and action \n\nis required in order to meet the world commitment to \n\nremaining \xef\xac\x81well below 2\xc2\xb0C\xef\xac\x82.23Section 1: climate change impacts, exposures, \nand vulnerabilitiesClimate change and human health are interconnected in \na myriad of complex ways.13 Building on the \nLancet Countdown\xe2\x84\xa2s previous work, section 1 of the 2019 report \n\ncontinues to track quantitative metrics along pathways of \n\npopulation vulnerability, exposure, and health outcomes \n\nthat are indicative of the cost to human health of climate \n\nchange, and thus of the urgent need to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. The impacts tracked here in turn motivate \n\nand guide climate change adaptation (section 2) and \n\nmitigation (section 3) interventions.Changes in warming and weather events are not evenly distributed across the globe, and some populations, \n\nincluding children, the elderly, and outdoor workers, are \n\nmore vulnerable than others. E\xcb\x9aorts to track the unequal \n\ne\xcb\x9aects of climate change are re\xcb\x9dected through indicators \n\nthat focus on particularly vulnerable populations, and \n\nlow-income and middle-income countries expe riencing \nthe worst of these e\xcb\x9aects.Although it is certainly true that the e\xcb\x9aects of climate \nchange vary by geographical location and that these e\xcb\x9aects \nwill not always be negative, any so-called positive e\xcb\x9aects \nwww.thelancet.com \n  Vol 394   November 16, 2019\n   1841are often short\n-term in nature, and quickly outweighed by \nother exposures. One such example is seen in Australia, \nwhere any bene\xcb\x9ct that might have been gained from CO2 fertilisation is both small and largely outweighed by \ngreater climate variation, with crop yields now stalling as \n\nharvests are increasingly a\xcb\x9aected by more frequent \n\ndrought.24 Even disregarding the negative e\xcb\x9aects of \ntemperature change, any CO2 fertilisation bene\xcb\x9cts are \nlikely to be short-term, as rising CO2 concentrations will \nnegatively a\xcb\x9aect grain quality.\n25\xc5\x9228For 2019, a new metric tracking exposure to wild\xcb\x9cres has \nbeen added (indicator 1.2.1), as has an expansion of climate \n\nsuitability of infectious diseases (indicator 1.4.1), to now \n\ninclude V cholerae transmission risk. These indi cators \nportray a world which is rapidly warming, where environ-\nmental and social systems are \nalready being exposed to the \ne\xcb\x9aects of climate change, which are subsequently a\xcb\x9aecting \n\nhuman health.Indicator 1.1: health and heatThe most immediate and direct impact of a changing \n\nglobal climate on human health is seen in the steady \n\nincrease in global average temperature, and the increased \n\nfrequency, intensity, and duration of extremes of heat. \n\nThe pathophysiological consequences of heat exposure \n\nin humans are well documented and under stood, and \ninclude heat stress and heat stroke, acute kidney injury,\n exacerbation of congestive heart failure,29 and increased \nrisk of interpersonal,30 and collective violence.31 In par-\nticular, during periods of extreme heat, young children \n\nhave a greater risk of electrolyte imbalance, fever, \n\nrespiratory disease, and kidney disease.32 Four indicators \nthat are related to heat are discussed here, tracking the \n\nvulnerabilities, exposures, and labour implications of a \n\nwarming world.Indicator \xcb\x9b.\xcb\x9b.\xcb\x9b: vulnerability to extremes of heat\xc5\xa0headline \n\xcb\x9anding: vulnerability to extremes of heat continues to rise \n\namong older populations in every region of the world, with the \n\nWestern Paci\xcb\x9ac, South-East Asia and African regions all seeing \n\nan increase in vulnerability of more than \xcb\x9b\xcb\x9d% since \xcb\x9b\xcb\x99\xcb\x99\xcb\x9d\nCertain populations are more vulnerable to the health \ne\xcb\x9aects of heat than others. Older populations are \nparticularly vulnerable, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as diabetes and cardiovascular, \n\nrespiratory, and renal disease).33 Outdoor workers, while younger and healthier overall, are also vulnerable due to \nheightened exposure to heat and sunlight. This indicator \npresents a heat vulnerability index which ranges from \n\n0 to 100 and includes the proportion of the population \nolder than age 65 years, prevalence of chronic diseases, \n\nand proportion of the population living in urban areas, \nwith the data and methods unchanged from previous \nyears (appendix p 1).Populations older than age 65 years, in all regions \nof the world, are becoming increasingly vulnerable. \nHowever, the highest increase in vulnerability\n from 1990 to 2017 has been seen in the Western Paci\xcb\x9cc \n\n(33\xc2\xb71% to 36\xc2\xb76%) and African (28\xc2\xb74% to 31\xc2\xb72%) regions. \n\nOverall, Europe remains the most vulnerable region to \nheat exposure (followed closely by the Eastern Mediter-\n\nranean region), due to its ageing population, high rates \nof urbanisation, and high prevalence of cardiovas cular and respiratory diseases, and diabetes.Indicator \xcb\x9b.\xcb\x9b.\xcb\x86: health and exposure to warming\xc5\xa0headline \n\xcb\x9anding: human populations are concentrated in the areas most \nexposed to warming, experiencing a mean summer temperature \n\nchange that is four times higher than the global average\nThis indicator compares the population-weighted summer temperature change from a 1986\xc5\x922005 baseline with the global average summer temperature change \nover the same period, using weather data from the \nEuropean Centre for Medium\n-Range W\neather Forecasts,\n34 ERA-Interim project and population data from the NASA Socioeconomic \nData and Applications Center (SEDAC) \nGridded Population of the World (GPWv4).\n35 Full details, \nalong with an explanation of improvements for the \n\n2019 report, which uses higher resolution climate and \npopulation data (0\xc2\xb75\xc2\xb0C grid instead of 0\xc2\xb775\xc2\xb0C grid) are \n\nprovided (appendix p 3).The population-weighted temperatures continue to \ngrow at a substantially faster pace than the global average, increasing the human health risk.

The increase in \n\nheatwave exposure events (220 million, which is 11 million \n\nmore than the 2015 record) was due to a series of heat-\nwaves across India (45 million additional exposures); \n\nacross central and northern Europe (31 million additional \n\nexposures in the EU); and across northeast Asia, where \n\nheatwaves a\xcb\x9aected Japan, the Korean peninsula, and \n\nNorthern China. 32 million exposures a\xcb\x9aected people \n1842 www.thelancet.com \n  Vol 394   November 16, 2019\n  older than age 65 years in Japan alone, the equivalent of \nalmost every person in this age group experi encing e\xcb\x9aects \nof a heatwave in 2018.38Indicat\xc5\xa0headline \xcb\x9anding: \nhigher temperatures continue to a\xcb\x9cect people\xe2\x84\xa2s ability to work. \n\nential work hours were lost \n\ndue to rising temperatures, compared with in the year \xcb\x86\xcb\x9d\xcb\x9d\xcb\x9d\nGeneral work productivity and ability to work are a\xcb\x9aected \nby temperature and humidity, which are both captured in \n\nthe Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) measurement. \n\nLabour productivity loss estimates for every degree \n\nincrease of WBGT beyond 24\xc2\xb0C range from 0\xc2\xb78% to 5%.39 Reduced labour productivity is often the \xcb\x9crst symptom of \n\nthe health e\xcb\x9aects of heat, and, if not addressed, could \n\nlead to more severe health e\xcb\x9aects, such as heat exhaustion \n\nand heat stroke.This indicator emphasises the important impact of \nclimate change on labour capacity in vulnerable popu-\nlations.40 It assigns work-fraction loss functions to di\xcb\x9aerent \nactivity sectors (service, manufacturing, and agriculture), \n\nlinking WBGT with the power (metabolic rate) typically \nexpended by a worker within each of these three sectors. This is then coupled with the proportion of the population \n\nworking within each of these three sectors to calculate \n\npotential work hours lost (WHL) by country. This indicator \n\nhas been improved to include the e\xcb\x9aect of sunlight \n\non the potential WHL by calculating the increase in \n\nWBGT using solar radiation data available from the ERA \n\ndata base (appendix pp 5\xc5\x926).35,41,42The global atmospheric temperature and humidity in \n2018 were slightly more favourable for work than in 2017, \n\nbut the upward trend of potential WHL since 2000 remains \n\nclear (\xcb\x9cgure 2). In 2018, 133\xc2\xb76 billion potential work hours \n\nwere lost; 45 billion hours more than in 2000.Additionally, a map is presented of the equivalent \npotential annual full-time work lost in the sun and the \nshade (\xcb\x9cgure 3). Of note, for 300 Watts (W) work in the \nshade (typical for manufacturing), over 10% potential \n\ndaily work hours were lost in densely populated regions \n\nsuch as south Asia. For 400 W work in the sun (typical \n\nfor agriculture and construction), even workers in the \n\nsouthern parts of the USA (below a latitude of 34\xc2\xb0N, with \n\nAlabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and \n\nTexas particularly a\xcb\x9aected), lost 15\xc5\x9220% of potential \n\ndaylight work hours in the hottest month of 2018.Indicator 1.2: health and extreme weather events\nIndicator \xcb\x9b.\xcb\x86.\xcb\x9b: wild\xcb\x9arries \n\nsaw an increase in annual daily population exposure to wild\xcb\x9ares \n\ned with India alone \n\nexperiencing an increase of \xcb\x86\xcb\x9b million annual daily exposures. \n\nThis increase not only poses a threat to public health, but also \n\nresults in major economic and social burdens in both high-income \n\nand low-income countries\nThe health e\xcb\x9aects of wild\xcb\x9cres range from direct thermal \ninjuries and death, to the exacerbation of acute and chronic \n\nrespiratory symptoms due to exposure to wild\xcb\x9cre smoke.43 Additionally, the global economic burden per person \n\na\xcb\x9aected by wild\xcb\x9cres is more than twice that of earthquakes \n\nand 48 times higher than that of \xcb\x9doods, although the global \n\nnumber of events and number of people a\xcb\x9aected by \xcb\x9doods \n\nare much higher than for wild\xcb\x9cres.44 Furthermore, climatic \nchanges, including increasing temperature and earlier \n\nsnowmelt, contribute to hotter, drier conditions, which \n\nincrease the risk of wild\xcb\x9cres.

At the same time, Africa has experienced a statistically \n\nsigni\xcb\x9acant increase in the number of people a\xcb\x9cected by these \n\ntypes of disasters\nThis indicator tracks the number of occurrences of \nweather-related disasters, the number of people a\xcb\x9aected, \nand the lethality of these events. These are formulated as a function of the hazard (magnitude and frequency) and the \n\nvulnerability and exposure of populations at risk, using \n\ndata from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology \n\nof Disasters.48 For the 2019 report, disasters have been \nseparated into two categories: \xcb\x9dood\n-related and \nstorm-related disasters; and heatwave, extreme temperature, and \n\ndrought-related disasters. Details of these methods and \ndata are summarised (appendix pp 10\xc5\x9213).For heatwaves, extreme temperature, and drought-related disasters, no statistically signi\xcb\x9ccant global trend \n\nwas identi\xcb\x9ced. \nOne explanation for this could be the \ngeographically local nature of such events. However, in the \n\ncase of \xcb\x9doods and storms, a statistically signi\xcb\x9ccant trend in \n\noccurrence was identi\xcb\x9ced individually across Africa, Asia, \n\nand the Americas. A statistically signi\xcb\x9ccant increase in \n\nthe number of people a\xcb\x9aected by \xcb\x9doods and storms in \n\nAfrica was also noted, although no statistically signi\xcb\x9ccant \n\nincrease in the lethality of these events was identi\xcb\x9ced.The relative stability of the lethality and number of \npeople a\xcb\x9aected by these disasters could possibly be linked \n\nto improved disaster preparedness (including improved \n\nearly warning systems) as well as increased investments \n\nin health-care services, and is discussed further in \nsection 2.49\xc5\x9251 Importantly, work from the 2015 \nLancet Commission shows that a business as usual trajectory is \nFigure \xcb\x9d:\n Map showing the average annual number of days people were exposed to wild\xcb\x9cres in 2018\nPerson-days exposed to \nwild\xcb\x9cre in 20180\n1\xc5\x9210\n11\xc5\x92100\n101\xc5\x921000\n1001\xc5\x9210 00010 001\xc5\x92100 000100 001\xc5\x921 000 0001 000 001\xc5\x9210 000 000www.thelancet.com \n  Vol 394   November 16, 2019\n   1845expected to result in an additional 2 billion \xcb\x9dood-exposure \nevents per year by 2090, which will likely overwhelm \nhealth systems and public infra structure.13Indicator 1.3: global health trends in climate-sensitive \ndiseases\nHeadline \xcb\x9anding: although mortality due to diarrhoeal diseases, \n\nmalnutrition, and malaria is improving, mortality due to dengue \n\nis rising in the regions most a\xcb\x9cected by these diseases\nAs described in the preceding indicators, climate change a\xcb\x9aects a wide range of disease processes. Corresponding \n\nhealth outcomes result from a complex interaction \n\nbetween the direct and indirect e\xcb\x9aects of climate change \n\nand social dynamics, such as population demographics, \neconomic development, and access to health services.13 This indicator provides a macro view of these interactions, \nusing GBD data to track mortality from diseases that are \nsensitive to climate change.52 Mortality due to earthquake \nand volcano events has been removed from the GBD \nforces of nature category for estimates of weather-related events.Global trends in climate-sensitive disease mortality from \n1990 to 2017 are shown, with all-cause mortality presented \nas a reference (\xcb\x9cgure 5). Death from diarrhoeal diseases and protein-energy malnutrition has declined considerably \nover this period in regions most a\xcb\x9aected (Africa, South-East Asia, and Eastern Mediterranean). Similarly\n, a marked \ndecrease in mortality from malaria since 2000 has been \n\nobserved in Africa. Socioeconomic development, improved \n\naccess to health care, and major global health initi atives in \nsanitation and hygiene, and vector control, have all \n\ncontributed to these improve ments in health outcomes.13,53 However, mortality from dengue fever continues to rise, \n\nparticularly in South\n-East Asia.Indicator 1.4: climate-sensitive infectious diseases\nIndicate suitability for infectious disease \n\ntransmission\xc5\xa0headline \xcb\x9anding: suitability for disease \n\ntransmission has increased for dengue, malaria, \nV cholerae and \nother pathogenic Vibrio species.

Suitability \n\nfor transmission of mosquito-borne infectious diseases is a\xcb\x9aected by factors including temperature, humidity \nand precipitation. For dengue, vectorial capacity\n, which expresses the average daily rate of subsequent cases in a \nsusceptible population resulting from one infected case, \nis calculated using a formula including the vector to \n\nhuman transmission probability per bite, the human \ninfectious period, the average vector biting rate, the \nextrinsic incubation period, and the daily survival \nperiod.54 For malaria, the number of months suitable \nfor transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and P vivax malaria parasites is calculated on the basis of tem-\nperature, precipitation, and humidity. Climate suitability \n\nfor these mosquito-borne diseases is averaged for the most recent \xcb\x9cve years for which data is available and \ncompared with a 1950s baseline.Vibrio \nspecies cause a range of human infections, including gastroenteritis, wound infections, septicaemia, \n\nand cholera. These bacteria are found in brackish marine \n\nwaters and cases of infections are in\xcb\x9duenced by sea \n\nsurface salinity, sea surface temperature, and chlorophyll \n\nA concentrations.55\xc5\x9257 Climate suitability for Vibrio \nspecies was estimated on the basis of sea surface salinity \n\nand sea surface temperature globally and focally for \n\ntwo regions (the Baltic and US northeast coastlines) \n\nwhere Vibrio \n(excluding V cholerae) infections are \nmost frequently observed. For pathogenic \nVibrio\n species \n\n(excluding V cholerae), an average of the 5 most recent \nyears for which data is available is compared with a \n\n1980s baseline, whereas the new V cholerae speci\xcb\x9cc \n\nanalysis compares data from the most recent 3 years \n\nwith a 2003\xc5\x9205 baseline (based on data availability). Full \ndetails on methods used are presented (appendix \n\npp 14\xc5\x9224).Climate suitability for transmission is rising for each \nof the pathogens studied. The second highest vectorial \n\ncapacity for both dengue vectors was recorded in 2017, \n\nwith the 2012\xc5\x9217 average 7\xc2\xb72% and 9\xc2\xb78% above baseline \n\nfor Aedes aegypti\n and Aedes albopictus\n, respectively \n(\xcb\x9cgure 6). This change emphasises the continued \nupward trend of climate suitability for transmission of \n\ndengue, with 9 of the 10 most suitable years occurring \n\nsince the year 2000. Malaria suitability continues to \n\nincrease in highland areas of Africa, with the 2012\xc5\x9217 \n\naverage 29\xc2\xb79% above baseline. The percentage of coastal \n\narea suitable for Vibrio\n infections from 2010 has \n\nincreased at northern latitudes (40\xc5\x9270\xc2\xb0 N) by 3\xc2\xb78%, \n\ncompared with the 1980s baseline, with 2018 the second \n\nmost suitable year on record (5% above the baseline; \n\n\xcb\x9cgure 7). The area of coastline suitable for Vibrio \nhas \nincreased by 31% in the Baltic coastline and 29% in the \n\nnortheastern coastline of the USA. Additionally, the \n\nnumber of days per year suitable for Vibrio\n in the Baltic reached 107 in 2018, which is double that of the early \n\n1980s baseline and the highest on record. Globally, \n\nenvironmental suitability for coastal V cholerae sensu lato has increased by 9\xc2\xb79%, driven by regional increases in \n\nAsia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and \n\nnorthern and western Africa.Indicatvulnerability to mosquito-borne diseases\xc5\xa0\nheadline \xcb\x9anding: climate change induced risk of \n\nmosquito-borne diseases could be o\xcb\x9cset by improvements in \n\npublic health systems.

They show worsening exposures \n\nand vulnerabilities along a range of temperature and \n\nprecipitation pathways, with reductions in crop yield \n\npotentials, and increases in vectorial capacity for a number \n\nof climate-sensitive diseases. These e\xcb\x9aects are felt most \nacutely by low-income and middle-income countries \nacross the world.Continued work on attribution remains an important consideration with regards to outcome. For example, \n\nmigration was addressed in earlier reports, in which \nquestions of attribution to climate change remained \nparticularly challenging.\n20,37 Irrespective of how climate \nchange migrants are counted,75 many factors contribute to health risks faced by migration. Resulting health \n\nimpacts depend on both pre-existing conditions (eg, mental health and nutritional status, desire to migrate, \nand existing health systems) along with interventions \n(eg, health-care access, provision \nof food and shelter, and \nchanging health-related resources).Similarly\n, in 2018, the links between climate change \nand mental health were presented.37 Mental health might \nbe negatively a\xcb\x9aected in various ways by heat waves, \nloss of property, and loss of livelihoods due to \xcb\x9doods,\n or climate-induced migra tion. However, although many\n varied links have been identi\xcb\x9ced between climate and \n\nmental health, they are highly socially and culturally \n\nmediated. Attempting to operationalise these linkages \n\nas a single-number indicator\xc5\xa0linking climate change \nand mental health outcomes\xc5\xa0remains elusive, yet \nquantifying these e\xcb\x9aects is of clear importance.76Section 2: adaptation, planning, and resilience for \nhealthAs knowledge of the health consequences of climate \nchange increases, so too does the urgent need to increase \n\ne\xcb\x9aorts to protect people from adverse e\xcb\x9aects, particularly \n\ngiven the slow progress of mitigation of these e\xcb\x9aects. \n\nHealth systems will be placed under increasing and \n\noverwhelming pressure, and adaptation to climate change \n\nis essential, even with the most ambitious mitigation \n\ne\xcb\x9aorts.58 An adaptation gap is apparent, emphasised in \nsome of the aforementioned impacts, and the rapid intro-\nduction of adaptation initiatives with better development \n\nstrategies and funding across all sectors is necessary to \nclose this divide. The health sector was selected as one of \n\nthe top three priority areas for adap tation in an analysis \nof Intended Nationally Determined C\nontributions \nprepared for the Paris Agreement.\n77By their very nature, adaptation and resilience measures \nare local and speci\xcb\x9cc to regional hazards and underlying \n\npopulation health needs. Identifying readily available \n\nglobal metrics, with adequate data and proximity to cli-\n\nmate change and to health adaptation, is particularly \n\nchallenging.78\xc5\x9280 Additionally, evaluating the success of any \nintervention is di\xcb\x9bcult, given that the goals of adaptation \n\nare inherently long-term, and no counterfactual is readily \navailable. Rising to this challenge, the work in this section has expanded, from the initial three indicators proposed \n\nin 2016,19 to the eight presented here. The structure of \nthese indicators, and this section, builds on the WHO \n\nOperational Framework for building climate resilient \n\nhealth systems,81 monitoring progress across the following \nselected domains: adaptation planning and assessment \n\n(indicators 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.1.3), adaptive information \n\nsystems (indicator 2.2), adaptation delivery and imple-\nmentation (indicators 2.3.1 and 2.3.2), and adaptation \n\n\xcb\x9cnancing (indicator 2.4.1).True to an iterative approach, many indicators have \nbeen further developed. For the indicators evaluating \n\nnational health adaptation planning and vulnerability \nmapping (indicators 2.1.1 and 2.1.2), the number of \ncountry respondents has increased from 40 to 101. \nAdditional information on implementation and govern-\n\nment funding is included alongside qualitative analysis, \n\nwhich was undertaken as part of the validation of the self-reported data. A \nnew indicator has been added, focusing \non air conditioning use as an adaptive measure to heat \nmortality (indicator 2.3.2). This is the \xcb\x9crst of a new suite \nof indicators under development, which monitor adap-\ntation to a speci\xcb\x9cc exposure pathway, complementing \n\nexisting work on health adaptation e\xcb\x9aorts.Several indicators in this section rely on self\n-reported \ndata in surveys of national and subnational governments to track health adaptation, with clear strengths and \n\nlimitations to this approach. Self\n-reported survey data is \nsubject to response and non-response error, with local\n veri\xcb\x9ccation di\xcb\x9bcult;\n79 however, the datasets here\xc5\xa0from \nthe WHO and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)\xc5\xa0\n\nprovide the best available information on national\n-level \nand city-level speci\xcb\x9cc health adaptation measures, globally.\n Further information on the validation techniques of the \n\nnational data is summarised (appendix pp 48\xc5\x9249).Indicator 2.1: adaptation planning and assessmentIndicator \xcb\x86.\xcb\x9b.\xcb\x9b: national adaptation plans for health\xc5\xa0headline \n\n\xcb\x9anding: recognition of the need for health adaptation to climate \n\nchange is widespread, and development planning is underway. \n\nIn \xcb\x86\xcb\x9d\xcb\x9b\xcb\x98, almost half of the countries surveyed declared that a \n\nnational health and climate change plan was in place\nOver the past decade, a steady increase in countries \nscaling up health adaptation projects to build climate \n1850 www.thelancet.com \n  Vol 394   November 16, 2019\n  resilience has been observed.82 This indicator, based on \ndata from the 2018 WHO Health and Climate Change \nCountry Survey,\n83 tracks the number of countries that \nhave a national health and climate change plan or \n\nstrategy, current levels of their implementation, and the \n\ncommitment of national health funds for achieving the \n\nhealth adaptation and mitigation priorities outlined \n\nby governments in these documents. Importantly, \n\nthe country response rate has more than doubled, \n\nwith 101 of the 194 Member States reporting in the \n\n2018 survey compared with 40 reporting in the \n\n2015 survey presented in earlier Lancet Countdown \nreports.20Global coverage of national adaptation plans for \nhealth is growing, with 51 of 101 countries now having a \n\nnational health and climate change plan in place. Just \n\nover half of these countries report at least a moderate \n\nlevel of implementation of their plans; however, chal-\n\nlenges to full implementation remain, with less \n\nthan 20% of countries reporting actions underway or \n\nplans in place to address most of their key priorities \n\n(\xcb\x9cgure 9). National funding for implementation of \nhealth and climate change plans was identi\xcb\x9ced as a \n\ncentral con straint with fewer than 4 in 10 countries \nreporting at least partial funding for the implementation \n\nof their main health adaptation and mitigation priorities.A further analysis of approximately 40 strategies or \nplans, collected as part of the survey, emphasises that \n\nthe comprehensiveness and scope of the national \n\nhealth and climate strategies or plans varied widely, \nwith only a small number of plans directly linked to the \n\nNational Adaptation Plan (NAP) process as part of the \n\nUN Framework Convention on Climate Change \n\n(UNFCCC). About 30% of the national health and \n\nclimate change plans were published more than 5 years \n\nago.

Unpublished data for household air conditioning \n\nuse, electricity consumption, and CO2 emissions was \nprovided by the International Energy Agency (IEA). \nThe prevented fraction,92 (the percent reduction in \nheatwave-related deaths due to a given proportion of \nthe population having household air con ditioning, \ncompared with a complete absence of household air \n\nconditioning) was calculated using a relative risk for heatwave-related mortality of 0\xc2\xb723 for having household \nair conditioning compared with not having household air conditioning,87 and the proportion of populations \nwith household air conditioning. The relative risk \n\nestimate used for these calculations is based on studies \n\nfocused on European and US populations, and further \n\nresearch is required to fully understand the e\xcb\x9aect \n\nmodi\xcb\x9ccation across di\xcb\x9aerent contexts.87 The air \npollution source attribution methods discussed in \n\nsection 3 (indicator 3.3.2) were used to calculate deaths \n\ndue to PM2\xc2\xb75 emissions from air conditioning.Between 2000 and 2016, the world\xe2\x84\xa2s air conditioning \nstock (residential and commercial) more than doubled \n\nto 1\xc2\xb762 billion units and the proportion of households \n\nwith air conditioning increased from 21% to about 30% \n\n(\xcb\x9cgure 10). In 2016, this proportion was 4% in India, \n14% in the EU, 58% in China, and more than 90% in \n\nthe USA and Japan. Correspondingly, the global pre\n vented \nfraction of heatwave-related mortality increased from 16% \nin 2000 to 23% in 2016, ranging from less than 10% in \nIndia, Indonesia, and South Africa to more than 66% in \n\nthe USA, Japan, and Korea. \nThese trends have also been associated with increased \nharms. In 2016, air conditioning accounted for 10% of \n\nglobal electricity consumption and 18\xc2\xb75% of electricity \n\nused in buildings.93 Under the IEA\xe2\x84\xa2s baseline scenario, \nthese \xcb\x9cgures will increase in 2050 to 16% and 30%, \n\nrespectively.\n93 Following the trend in the proportion of \nhouseholds with air conditioning, CO2 emissions from \nair conditioning use tripled from 0\xc2\xb735 gigatons in \n\n1990 to about 1\xc2\xb71 gigatons in 2016 (\xcb\x9cgure 10), and are \n\nprojected to rise to 2 gigatons in 2050 in the IEA\xe2\x84\xa2s \n\nbaseline scenario.93 In 2016, the number of premature \ndeaths due to PM2\xc2\xb75 exposure attributable to air \nconditioning was 2480 in India, 2662 in China, 1088 in \n\nthe EU, and 749 in the USA.Fortunately, various paths forward provide for \nadaptation against heat-related mortality for those who \nneed it, without the associated harms of greenhouse gases and PM2\xc2\xb75 emissions, excessive electricity demand, \nand undue contribution to the urban heat island e\xcb\x9aect. \n\nAir conditioning use could be reduced by promoting \n\nenergy e\xcb\x9bcient appliances and energy e\xcb\x9bcient building \n\ndesign through strong, enforced building codes.93 Traditional building designs in tropical and sub\n-tropical \nregions reduce thermal stresses by providing shade, thermal mass, insulation, and ventilation.93 Harms \nassociated with air conditioning can be greatly reduced \n\nby increasing its e\xcb\x9bciency,\n93 by generating electricity \nfrom non-fossil-fuel sources, and by implementing the \nKigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase-down hydro\xcb\x9duorocarbons.94(Figure 11 continues on next page)\nAdaptation to Resilience and Climate Change spending (\xc2\xa3 million)\n0300060009000AAfrican region2015\xc5\x92162016\xc5\x92172017\xc5\x9218Fiscal year\nRegion of the Americas\n2015\xc5\x92162016\xc5\x92172017\xc5\x9218Fiscal year\nEastern Mediterranean region2015\xc5\x92162016\xc5\x92172017\xc5\x9218Fiscal year\nEuropean region2015\xc5\x92162016\xc5\x92172017\xc5\x9218Fiscal year\nSouth-East Asia region\n2015\xc5\x92162016\xc5\x92172017\xc5\x9218Fiscal year\nWestern Paci\xcb\x9cc region2015\xc5\x92162016\xc5\x92172017\xc5\x9218Fiscal year\nHealthHealth-relatedwww.thelancet.com \n  Vol 394   November 16, 2019\n   1853Indicator 2.4: spending on adaptation for health and \nhealth-related activities\nHeadline \xcb\x9anding: in \xcb\x86\xcb\x9d\xcb\x9b\xcb\x98, global spending on health adaptation \n\nto climate change was estimated t \n\nadaptation spending, and health-related spending was estimated \n\nThese estimates represent increases in \n\nabsolute and relative terms over previous data\nA higher demand for health adaptation measures \nrequires increased adaptation funding.

This percentage increase is notably \n\nlarger than the change in total adaptation spending \n\ngenerally (an increase of 6\xc2\xb75% from 2016\xc5\x922017). At the \n\ncountry level, growth of health adaptation spending \n\nranged from 17\xc2\xb75% (UK) to 10% (Latvia); however, \n\nsmaller increases and less variation were recorded \n\nfor health-related values, from 11\xc2\xb71% (UK) to 6\xc2\xb78% \n(Kazakhstan). Impor tantly, health still represented a \nsmall proportion of the total adaptation spend, having grown from 4\xc2\xb76% in 2015\xc5\x9216 to 5\xc2\xb70% in 2017\xc5\x9218.Grouped by WHO Region, the highest per\n-capita \nspending for 2017\xc5\x9218 is in the Americas (\xc2\xa34\xc2\xb72 for health, \xc2\xa311\xc2\xb72 for health\n-related spending; \xcb\x9cgure 11). \nBy contrast, \nin the African, Eastern Mediterranean, and South\n-East \nAsian regions, per-capita health adaptation spending is \nless than \xc2\xa31.ConclusionAlthough many of the indicators presented in section 2 \n\nare moving in a positive direction, the pace of the \n\nadaptation response from the health community \n\nremains slow. The number of countries with national \n\nadaptation plans for health and the number of countries \n\nand cities that have assessed health risk and \n\nvulnerabilities has increased, along with the spending \n\non health adaptation.

This section will continue to expand in future years by \nmonitoring mitigation and health co-bene\xcb\x9cts in other important sectors, including industry, buildings, and \n\nland use.Overall, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels have risen by 2\xc2\xb76% from 2016 to 2018 (indicator 3.1.1). Concerningly, \n\nthe previous downward trend in coal supply has reversed, \nwith a 1\xc2\xb77% increase recorded in total primary energy \nsupply from 2016 to 2018 (indicator 3.1.2). However, \n\nmore encouragingly, growth in renewables continues \n\napace and comprised 45% of total growth in electricity \ngeneration. At present, modern renewables represent \n\n5\xc2\xb75% of global electricity generation (indicator 3.1.3), but \nare predicted to reach 30% by 2023.102 The implications of maintenance of both of these trends are important for air \npollution. A con tinued demand for fossil fuels and an increase in coal consumption have resulted in the \nnumber of deaths attributable to ambient air pollution \nremaining stagnant (2\xc2\xb79 million deaths in 2016; \nindicator 3.3.2).The transport sector \nis an equally entrenched emitter \nof greenhouse gases, with emissions and fuel use main-\ntaining a modest growth trajectory of 0\xc2\xb77% per capita \n\nCO2e in 2016. Although use of electric vehicles has \nincreased, they continue to represent a small proportion \n\nof the global vehicles worldwide. Yet, countries such as \n\nChina have positioned electric vehicles as the future of \n\ndriving with electricity in transport, with 21\xc2\xb74% growth in \n\nper capita usage from 2015 to 2016, rising from 1\xc2\xb75% to \n\n1\xc2\xb78% of total fuel use (indicator 3.4).Feeding the global population is a crucially important \naspect of health and wellbeing along with ensuring \n\neconomic stability and security. However, the agriculture \n\nand food sector are both energy and carbon intense and \n\nan important area for climate change mitigation. Global \n\nagricultural greenhouse\n-gas emissions \n(indicator 3.5) \nhave increased between 2000 and 2016 by 14% for \n\nlivestock and 10% for crops.As outlined in sections 1 and 2, the health sector is on the frontline of climate change and plays a vital role in \nany response. This sector is also a major contributor of \ngreenhouse-gas emissions (indicator 3\xc2\xb76), with global estimates as high as 4\xc2\xb76% of global emissions in 2016.Indicator 3.1: emissions from the energy system\nIndicator \xcb\x87\xc2\xb7\xcb\x9b.\xcb\x9b: carbon intensity of the energy system\xc5\xa0\n\nheadline \xcb\x9anding: in \xcb\x86\xcb\x9d\xcb\x9b\xcb\x98, the carbon intensity of the energy \n\nsystem remained unchanged from \xcb\x9b\xcb\x99\xcb\x99\xcb\x9d.

Energy use, particularly \n\nresidential combustion, is a major contributor to this \n\npollutionThe world is becoming increasingly urbanised, with \nalmost 70% urbanisation of the global population ex pected \nby 2050.130 Because of the increased popu lation and higher \nconcentrations of emissions, many cities have become hot spots of air pollution. Few cities world\n wide have achieved \nPM2\xc2\xb75 concentrations that are below the WHO guideline of \nan annual mean of 10 \xc2\xb5g/m\xc2\xb3, and many cities exceed this \n\nguideline amount several- fold.131 The highest measured \nconcentrations currently have been reported in south and \n\neast Asia, while data gaps exist in other world regions. The \n\nfact that these high PM\n2\xc2\xb75 concentrations have been further \nincreasing or stagnant in many regions of the developing \n\nworld is particularly concerning. A positive exception to \n\nthis trend is China, where many highly polluted cities have \n\nimproved air quality because of their ambitious emission \n\ncontrol e\xcb\x9aorts. Cities in Europe and the USA have seen \n\nslowly decreasing PM2\xc2\xb75 concentrations with e\xcb\x9aective \nimplementation of air pollution control legislation and \n\nregulation.This analysis estimates source contributions to ambient \nPM2\xc2\xb75 concentrations in urban areas outside Europe \n(more than 3500 cities with more than 100 000 inhabi-tants), with results aggregated to the WHO world \n\nregions\xc5\xa083% of these cities do not meet the WHO \n\nguide line regarding ambient PM2\xc2\xb75 concentrations.In most regions, residential combustion of solid fuels for cooking and heating was the dominant source of high \nPM2\xc2\xb75 concentrations in 2016.

In this setting, cooking \n\nis done with solid fuels (14\xc2\xb76%), kerosene (72\xc2\xb79%), or \n\nelectricity (12\xc2\xb75%). Most dwellings do not have space heating \n\n(84\xc2\xb76%), with the rest using solid fuel heaters from June to \n\nAugust. Houses without electricity use kerosene-burning \n\nkoroboi lamps for lighting for the whole year, and 8 h average \n\nambient outdoor pollution levels are around 67 \xc2\xb5g/m\xc2\xb3.\n118Indoor exposure and space heating estimates were estimated \n\non the basis of 2016 levels using EnergyPlus,\n119 calibrated to \nmonitored indoor levels in dwellings using di\xcb\x9derent fuel types \n\nand ventilation behaviours.\n120 Two scenarios were modelled, \ninvolving the following changes in exposure and heating \n\nenergy consumption.The \xcb\x9crst scenario modelled electri\xcb\x9ccation of all existing stoves, \nlamps, and heaters using the standard electrical network, which \n\nwas assumed to reduce outdoor pollution by 40% on the basis \n\nof the estimated contribution of residential combustion to \n\nannual mean air pollution in Nairobi from the GAINS model.\n121The second scenario modelled electri\xcb\x9ccation as in the \xcb\x9crst \n\nscenario, but with low energy lighting, and heater installation \nextended to all dwellings. Additionally, upgrades to dwelling \n\nenergy e\xcb\x9bciency and airtightness inline with local sustainable \n\ndesign guidelines were modelled.\n122Current mean 24-hour exposures in Viwandani are estimated \n\nto average 60 \xc2\xb5g/m\xc2\xb3 with the fuels producing an estimated \n\n425 kg of CO\n2e per household year. Electri\xcb\x9ccation was \nestimated to result in halving of both greenhouse-gas \n\nemissions and PM2\xc2\xb75 air pollution (and hence premature \ndeaths associated with PM\n2\xc2\xb75), with annual greenhouse-gas \nemissions reduced to 210 kg of CO\n2e per year and an annual \naverage PM\n2.5 concentration of 31 \xc2\xb5g/m\n3. For upgrades to the \nbuilding envelope and increased electric heating and lighting \n\ncoverage, the decrease in CO\n2e emissions was similar to that \nfor electri\xcb\x9ccation, but with a substantially greater reduction \n\nin PM2\xc2\xb75 concentrations down to an annual average of \n25 \xc2\xb5g/m3, and hence a reduction in premature deaths \nassociated with air pollution. However, these changes do not \n\nreduce indoor exposures to less than the WHO-recommended \n\nlimit of 10 \xc2\xb5g/m\xc2\xb3. Therefore, reduction of indoor PM\n2\xc2\xb75 to \nadequate and safe concentrations would also necessitate \n\nfurther substantial reductions in outdoor ambient levels or \n\nthe application of additional technologies such as air \xcb\x9cltration \n\nsystems.www.thelancet.com \n  Vol 394   November 16, 2019\n   1859Results for 2016 are similar to the estimates for 2015, \nwith an overall number of premature deaths attributable to ambient PM2\xc2\xb75 estimated at 2\xc2\xb79 million. The dominant contribution varies between and within world regions: in \nAfrica, household cooking primarily contributes to high \n\nPM2\xc2\xb75 concentrations; whereas in other regions, industry, \ntransport, electricity generation, and agriculture are the \nprimary contributors (\xcb\x9cgure 16\n). Small decreases in \n\nthe number of premature deaths have been observed in \n\nthe European region and the Western Paci\xcb\x9cc region \n\n(mainly from closing of coal power plants). Sustained \n\nimprove ments over the past 10 years have been recorded \nin these regions, presumably due to implementation of \n\nend-of-pipe emission controls on power plants (Western\n Paci\xcb\x9cc) and on other emission sectors in Europe. However, \n\nworld wide, more than 440 000 premature deaths are still \nestimated to be associated with coal burning.Indicator 3.4: sustainable and healthy transport\nHeadline \xcb\x9anding: global road transport fuel use increased by \n\nt-capita basis.

National-level studies for the USA,144 Canada,\n145 and Australia,\n146 have used environmentally-extended input-output (EEIO) \nmodelling to show that health-care sector emissions \ncontribute between 4% and 10% of total greenhouse-gas \nemis sions in these countries. EEIO models have been \nwidely used since the 1970s,147 and underpin consumption-based accounting of emissions done at national and global \n\nscales.148 An important advantage of using EEIO modelling \nis that health-care sector emissions are estimated on a life \ncycle basis, meaning that all emissions are accounted for, \nfrom the electricity use of health-care facilities, to the \nenergy to produce and transport medical equipment and pharmaceuticals.National\n-level studies cannot easily be compared because \nof di\xcb\x9aerences in how emission inventories, monetary \ninput-output tables, and health expenditure data are \ncollected in each country. Additionally, a proportion of \nhealth-care sector emissions in each country is imported \nfrom other countries as embodied carbon in traded commodities, thus requiring a global scope and the use of \n\nmulti-region input-output (MRIO) models that cover more \nthan one country. For this edition of The\n Lancet Countdown, a standardised, international measure of \n\nhealth-care sector greenhouse-gas emissions was created \nusing multiple MRIO models (EXIOBASE, WIOD; \xcb\x9cgure 19) that cover 40\xc5\x9247 countries and rest-of-world \nregions, in combination with WHO health expenditure \ndata for 187 countries, assigned to the MRIO model \n\ngeographic units.Variations in per\n-capita greenhouse-gas emissions \nassociated with health care as a function of time, a\xcb\x99uence, and the proportion of national economic output spent on \n\nhealth care are shown (\xcb\x9cgure 19). Per capita, US emissions \nare substantially higher than those of any other country \n\nand have risen steadily over the study period 2007\xc5\x9216, \n\nwith a 19% increase.

By contrast, health\n-care greenhouse-gas emis-sions in Greece showed a marked decrease (GR, \xc5\x9235%), \nprobably re\xcb\x9decting the economic hardships. Results using \nthe WIOD MRIO model show similar trends but slightly \nlower absolute greenhouse-gas emissions. The lowest \nper capita emissions modelled were for India (IN) and Indonesia (ID), which were less than 2\xc2\xb75% of values \n\nrecorded for the USA. Comparison of emissions per capita \n\nand Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita show a \n\nlevelling o\xcb\x9a trend for health-care emissions versus \na\xcb\x99uence, except for in the USA.Overall, health care was responsible for approximately 2250 metric tonnes of CO2e in 2016, or 4\xc2\xb76% of the global \ntotal emissions (excluding land use change). A parallel \n\nglobal analysis using a di\xcb\x9aerent MRIO model (EORA) \n\nmeasuring CO\n2 only (excluding other green\n house gases) \nfor 36 countries determined a health-care contribution of \n4\xc2\xb74% to the global total for the countries considered,\n149 corroborating the results presented here. Although global \n\nhealth-sector greenhouse-gas emissions are rising, e\xcb\x9aorts\n to reduce these have begun (panel 3).ConclusionThe indicators of section 3 present a mix of encouraging \n\nand concerning trends. Renewable electricity generation \n\ncontinues to grow, as does access to energy, and electric \n\nvehicle sales. However, the carbon intensity of the energy \n\nsystem remains unchanged, with coal supply increasing, \n\nreversing the 2014\xc5\x9216 downward trend, and a substantial \ne\xcb\x9aort is required to decarbonise the agricultural sector and \n\nthe health\n-care sector. \nIn summary, greenhouse\n-gas \nemissions continue to rise. Notably, the year 2020 is \nimportant for two reasons\xc5\xa0it is the year that the \n\nimplementation period of the Paris Agreement begins, \n\nand the year during which most studies suggest global \n\nemissions must peak to remain on the path to achieving \n\nthe 1\xc2\xb75\xc2\xb0C goal. To meet both commitments, a substantially \n\nstronger global response is urgently required, to reduce \n\ngreenhouse-gas emissions and minimise the future health \nrisks of climate change. The health sector has an important \nrole to play in achieving these goals, both by reducing its \n\nown emissions and working with policy makers to help \n\ndesign and implement measures that reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and maximise health co-bene\xcb\x9cts.Section 4: economics and \xcb\x9cnanceSection 4 examines the \xcb\x9cnancial and economic dimen-\n\nsions of the e\xcb\x9aects of climate change, and of mitigation \ne\xcb\x9aorts required to respond to these changes. Although \nmany indicators in this section could appear to be distant \nfrom human health, they are key to tracking the low-carbon transition that underpins current and future \ndeterminants of human \nhealth and wellbeing described \nin sections 1\xc5\x923.The projected economic cost of inaction to tackle climate change is enormous. For example, compared \n\nwith maintaining a 2\xc2\xb0C limit, the costs of 3\xc2\xb0C of warming \nare expected to reach US$4 trillion per year by 2100 \n(around 5% of total global GDP in 2018), and the \ntotal economic costs of a 4\xc2\xb0C rise are estimated at \nUS$17\xc2\xb75 trillion (over 20% of GDP in 2018).152Investment to mitigate climate change substantially reduces these risks and generates further economic \nbene\xcb\x9cts. For example, the UK\xe2\x84\xa2s independent Committee \n\non Climate Change calculated that achieving net-zero emissions in the UK in 2050, in line with the more \nambitious objective of the Paris Agreement, is likely to \n\nrequire investments of 1\xc5\x922% of the UK\xe2\x84\xa2s GDP in 2050. \nHowever, if the economic value of co\n-bene\xcb\x9cts to human health (and \nsavings to the NHS\xc5\xa0for example, from \nreduced air pollution), and the creation of low-carbon industrial opportunities are considered, the economic \nimplications are likely to be positive.153 Global economic bene\xcb\x9cts are likely to be maximised (and costs minimised) \nif strong policy action is taken as soon as possible to \naccelerate the low-carbon transition.The nine indicators in this section fall into four broad themes: economic \ncosts of climate change (indicator 4.1); \neconomic bene\xcb\x9cts of tackling climate change and air \npollution (indicator 4.2); investing in a low- carbon economy (indicators 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, and 4.3.4); and \npricing greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels (indicators 4.4.1, 4.4.2, and 4.4.3).The 2019 report adds an additional indicator tracking the economic \nvalue of change in mortality associated \nwith air pollution (indicator 4.2).Panel \xcb\x9b:\n Response of the health-care sector to climate change\nHealth systems are increasingly faced with the dual challenges of responding to the health \nimpacts of climate change and reducing the contribution of the health-care sector to \n\ngreenhouse-gas emissions. From 2013 to 2018, participants from health systems, health \n\ncentres, and hospitals, from 19 di\xcb\x9derent countries, and representing 9199 health centres \n\nand 1693 hospitals, have participated in the Health Care Climate Challenge. The Challenge \n\naddresses key areas including local climate change risk assessments, health adaptation plans, \n\nfossil fuel and renewable energy project investments, and works with government agencies \n\nto support greenhouse-gas emission reductions and health-care sector adaptation.A leader in climate action progress is Kaiser Permanente (KP), one of the largest not-for-\npro\xcb\x9ct health systems in the USA, serving 12\xc2\xb73 million members. Between 2008 and 2017, \n\nKP reduced its operational greenhouse-gas emissions by 29%, and increased its membership \n\nby 36%. As of early 2018, 36 KP facilities hosted onsite solar panels. KP is working to increase \n\nits purchasing of renewable electricity to 100% of total usage by 2020. Anaesthetic gases \n\naccount for 3% of KP\xe2\x84\xa2s greenhouse-gas emissions. Between 2014 and 2018, KP achieved a \n\n24% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions associated with its use of anaesthetic gases \n\nthrough progressive elimination of the drug Des\xcb\x9aurane.\n150The largest example of a health system taking steps to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions \n\nand other environmental e\xcb\x9dects comes in the form of the UK National Health Service \n\n(NHS). A national-level detailed analysis of government funded health care shows that \n\nthe NHS public health and social sector in England reduced its greenhouse-gas emissions \n(excluding chloro\xcb\x9auorocarbons) by 18\xc2\xb75% from 2007 to 2017, while clinical activity \n\nincreased by 27\xc2\xb75% over the same time period.\n151 E\xcb\x9dorts are also being made to reduce \nwater use, plastic waste, and air pollution from the NHS.\nwww.thelancet.com \n  Vol 394   November 16, 2019\n   1863Indicator 4.1: economic losses associated with \nclimate-related extreme events\n\nHeadline \xcb\x9anding: in \xcb\x86\xcb\x9d\xcb\x9b\xcb\x98, a total of \xcb\x98\xcb\x87\xcb\x9b climate-related \n\nextreme events resulted in overall global economic losses of \n\nwere in high-income \n\ncountries and insured, no measurable losses from events in \n\nlow-income countries were covered by insurance\nThe indicators in section 1 presented changes in exposures \nand resulting e\xcb\x9aects on health of climate\n-related extreme\n events (indicators 1.2.1, 1.2.2, and 1.2.3).

Each YLL is assigned a \n\nValue of a Life Year of \xe2\x80\xa250\n 000, which is the lower bound estimate as suggested by the EU Impact Assessment \nGuidelines.\n156 Further details regarding this indicator are \ndiscussed (appendix pp 90\xc5\x9293).As described under indicator 3.3.2, anthropogenic PM2\xc2\xb75 pollution decreased between 2015 and 2016 in Europe, \n\nlargely because of a reduction in emissions from the \n\npower sector. If the population of the EU in 2015 were \n\nexposed to anthropogenic PM2\xc2\xb75 emissions at the con-centrations recorded in 2016 (rather than the concentration \n\nrecorded in 2015) consistently to the year 2115, the total \n\nannual average economic value of the reduction in YLLs \n\nwould be about \xe2\x80\xa25\xc2\xb72 billion. However, even at the \n\nconcentrations of anthropogenic PM2\xc2\xb75 pollution recorded \nin 2016, the total annual average cost to the population of \n\n2015 would still be \xe2\x80\xa2129 billion, with the greatest costs \n\ngenerally found in countries with the largest populations. \n\nThe greatest projected average life lost per person due to \n\nhigh ambient PM2\xc2\xb75 concentrations is seen in Hungary, \nRomania, and Poland (at more than 8 months per person), \n\nwith an EU average of 5\xc2\xb77 months of life lost per person.For the \xcb\x9crst iteration of this indicator, calculation of \nannual YLLs attributable to PM2\xc2\xb75 exposure in a given year \nwas not possible. However, methodological re\xcb\x9cnements \n\nshould allow this metric to be reported in the 2020 report.Indicator 4.3: investing in a low-carbon economy\nIndicatestment in new coal capacity\xc5\xa0headline \n\n\xcb\x9anding: global investment in new coal-\xcb\x9ared electricity capacity \n\ndeclined again in \xcb\x86\xcb\x9d\xcb\x9b\xcb\x98, continuing the downward trend \n\nobserved since \xcb\x86\xcb\x9d\xcb\x9b\xcb\x9b\nIndicator 3.1.2 tracks progress on coal phase-out through \nthe total primary energy \nsupply of coal, while this indicator \ndiscusses the future of coal-\xcb\x9cred power generation \nthrough tracking investments in coal-\xcb\x9cred capacity.\nThe data source for this indicator (IEA) remains the same as in the 2017 Lancet Countdown report;\n20 however, \nthe methodology has altered and has been retrospectively applied to reanalyse all data presented. The revised \napproach considers ongoing capital spending, with \ninvestment in a new plant spread evenly from the year \nnew construction begins, to the year it becomes \noperational. Previously, data was presented as a so\n-called overnight investment, in which all capital spending on a \nnew plant is assigned to the year in which the plant \nbecame operational (appendix p 93). Data for 2006\xc5\x9217 \nusing the overnight method are presented for comparison \nwith the ongoing capital spending method (\xcb\x9cgure 21).Although TPES for coal increased in 2018 (indicator 3.1.2), investment in new coal-\xcb\x9cred electricity generating capa city \ncontinued the \ndownward trend observed since 2011. \nNotably, this decline was mostly due to reduced investment \n\nin the same countries that increased their coal TPES in \n\n2018 (China and India), providing hope for coal phase-out. \nThe number of total Final Investment Decisions (ie, the \ndecision to begin construction) declined by 30% in 2018, \n\nwith costs and construction times for new plants generally \n\nincreasing because of larger, more e\xcb\x9bcient, and complex \n\ndesigns, and the use of advanced pollution control systems, \n\nin response to concerns regarding air quality.\n157Indicatestments in low-carbon energy and energy \n\xc5\xa0headline \xcb\x9anding: trends in energy investments are \n\ncurrently heading in the wrong direction.\n In \xcb\x86\xcb\x9d\xcb\x9b\xcb\x98, investments in \nfossil fuels increased, whereas investments in low-carbon energy \n\ndecreased\nIndicator 4.3 monitors global investment in low\n-carbon \nenergy, energy e\xcb\x9bciency, fossil fuels, and electricity\n networks.

Similarly, values for hydro-\n\npower and other technologies for renewable energy \nemployment have been revised, following methodological \nchanges (appendix pp 95\xc5\x9296).In 2018, around 11 million people were employed either \ndirectly or indirectly in the global renewable energy \n\nindustry. This value represents a 4\xc2\xb72% increase from \n\n2016, with growth in \xcb\x9cve of the six renewable energy \n\ncategories.

Weighted\n-average prices in early 2019 were 13% higher than 2018 prices, driven in large part by an increasing price under the EU \nEmissions Trading \nScheme (EU ETS; the largest carbon \npricing instrument in the world, responsible for nearly \nhalf of the economic value of all instruments com-\nbined). However, the weighted average of these carbon \n\npricing instruments remains insu\xcb\x9bcient to remain \xef\xac\x81well \n\nbelow 2\xc2\xb0C\xef\xac\x82, which would require a carbon price of \n\nUS$40\xc5\x9280/tCO2e by 2020,168 and the revenue generated through carbon pricing (described in indicator 4.4.3) is \nfar less than the potential annual impacts of unmitigated \nclimate change on global GDP.152Further carbon pricing instruments are under consider-\nation (\xcb\x9cgure 25). With the addition of these instruments\xc5\xa0\n\nand in particular the Chinese national Emissions Trading \n\nScheme (ETS; replacing the existing subnational so-called \npilots), more than 20% of global anthropogenic green-\nhouse-gas emissions will be covered by carbon price.169Indicatuse of carbon pricing revenues\xc5\xa0headline \xcb\x9anding: \nrevenues from carbon pricing instruments increased by \n\nUS$\xcb\x9b\xcb\x9d billion betw, \n\ned to further climate change mitigation \n\nactivitiesAs the previous indicator outlined, adequately pricing \ncarbon is essential for mitigating greenhouse\n-gas emis-\nsions. How the revenue generated by these pricing instru ments is used will \nalso have important conse-\nquences. Four ways the revenue could be used include: \n\ninvestment in further mitigation; investment in \nadaptation; recycling for other purposes (such as \n\nenabling the reduction of other taxes or levies); and \ncontributing to other general government funds. This \nindicator tracks the total government revenue from \ncarbon pricing instruments and the area in which it will \nbe allocated.Data on revenue generated is provided on the WBG \nCarbon Pricing Dashboard,\n167 with revenue allocation information obtained from various sources. Only instru-\nments with revenue estimates and with revenue received \n\nby the administering authority before redistribution are \n\nconsidered. Further information regarding the metho-\n\ndology and various sources used to obtain information \n\non revenue allocation are presented (appendix pp 104\xc5\x92106).Government revenue generated from carbon pricing \ninstru ments in 2018 \ntotalled over US$43 billion; \na $10 billion increase from the $33 billion generated in \n\n2017. This change was driven by increasing prices of \n\nallowances sold at auction in the EU ETS; higher tax \n\nrates for instruments in Alberta, British Columbia, and \n\nFrance; and allowance sales in California and Quebec.\n169The revenue allocated to mitigation activities increased \nby about US$10 billion between 2017 and 2018, and \nrevenue allocated to revenue recycling and general funds \nalso increased (table 2). Revenue allocated to adaptation \n\nreduced substantially, from more than US$1\xc2\xb75 billion to \n\naround $250 million.ConclusionSection 4 has presented indicators on the economic \n\nimpacts of climate change, the \xcb\x9cnancial and economic \n\nunder pinnings of climate change mitigation, and the \neconomic value \nof the associated health bene\xcb\x9cts. \nThe results of these indicators suggest that the shift to a \n\nlow carbon global economy is slowing in various sectors, \n\nand previously promising trends emphasised in the \n\n2018 report have been reversed. Given the need to \n\ntransition the global economy to net-zero greenhouse-gas \nemissions by 2050 to limit warming to well below 2\xc2\xb0C, governments at all levels\xc5\xa0in collaboration with \n\nthe private sector and the population\xc5\xa0must take imme-\ndiate steps towards implementing strong, ambitious \n\npolicies and related actions to steer and rapidly accelerate \n\ntheir economies towards a low-carbon state. The health \nsector and health professionals can contribute through the removal of institutional investment in fossil fuels, \n\nassessments of the health economics of mitigation \n\nco-bene\xcb\x9cts, and by communicating the negative exter-\nnalities associated with the continued use of fossil fuels.Section 5: public and political engagementAs the previous sections have emphasised, climate change \n\nis human in both origins and e\xcb\x9aects. Its origins lie in the \n\nburning of fossil fuels, particularly during early industrial \n\nperiods, and its e\xcb\x9aects include an increasing toll on \n\nhuman health. Reductions in global greenhouse\n-gas emis-sions at the speed required by the Paris Agreement\n depend on engagement by all sectors of society.\nIn the 2019 Lancet Countdown report, section 5 focuses \non engagement in four domains: the media, govern-\nment, corporate sector and, for the \xcb\x9crst time, individual \n\nengagement. It tracks trends in engagement across the \nlast decade, complementing this evidence with analyses \nof the content and dynamics of engagement in 2018. \nThe methods for an indicator relating to a \xcb\x9cfth domain, \n\nscienti\xcb\x9cc engagement, are being re\xcb\x9cned to ensure the \nlong-term sustainability of this work, and will be reported again in 2020. In every case, indicators in this section \nbuild on methods used in earlier Lancet Countdown reports, which continue to be re\xcb\x9cned and extended.The media is central to public understanding of climate \nchange; it provides a key resource through which people \n\nmake sense of climate change and assess the actions of \nValue (US$)\nProportion of total funds\nMitigation24\xc2\xb736 billion56\xc2\xb76%\nAdaptation258 million0\xc2\xb76%\nRevenue recycling5\xc2\xb750 billion12\xc2\xb78%\n\nGeneral funds12\xc2\xb791 billion30%\n\nTotal revenue43\xc2\xb703 billion100%\nTable \xcb\x9a:\n Carbon pricing revenues and allocation in 2018\nwww.thelancet.com \n  Vol 394   November 16, 2019\n   1869governments to address it.170\xc5\x92173 The media indicator (5.1) \nincludes an analysis of global coverage of health and \nclimate change in 62 newspapers from 2007 to 2018. For \n\nthe 2019 Lancet Countdown report, this has expanded to \ninclude coverage of health and climate change in China\xe2\x84\xa2s \n\nPeople\xe2\x84\xa2s Daily\n (in its Chinese-language edition, Renmin Ribao). As the o\xcb\x9bcial outlet of the Chinese party-state, the \nPeople\xe2\x84\xa2s Daily\n is China\xe2\x84\xa2s most in\xcb\x9duential newspaper.\n174 The indicator has been further enhanced by a content \n\nanalysis of the elite press in two contrasting societies, \n\nIndia and the USA. Elite newspapers both re\xcb\x9dect and \n\nshape engage ment in climate change by governments \nand elite groups.175\xc5\x92179The internet is an increasingly important medium of \ncivic engagement and has transformed individual access \n\nto global knowledge and debates. The second indicator \n\ntracks engagement in health and climate change \n\nthrough individuals\xe2\x84\xa2 information\n-seeking behaviour on \nthe online encyclopaedia, Wikipedia.180 Because of its \naccessibility, breadth, and user trust, Wikipedia is one of \n\nthe most widely used online resources.181\xc5\x92185Recognising that climate change is harming people, the \nglobal public support government action to decrease \n\ngreenhouse-gas emissions.186\xc5\x92188 The third indicator relates \nto government engagement in health and climate change \n\nand focuses on high-level government engagement in \nhealth and climate change at the UN General Assembly. \nIt tracks references at the UN General Debate, the major \n\ninternational forum during which national leaders have \n\nthe opportunity to address the global community on \n\nissues they consider important.189,190The fourth indicator relates to the corporate sector, \nrecognised to be central to a rapid transition to a carbon-free economy, both through its business practices and \n\nwider political and public in\xcb\x9duence.191\xc5\x92193 Focusing on \nthe health sector, the indicator tracks engagement in \n\nhealth and climate change through analyses of the \n\nannual reports submitted by companies signed up to \n\nthe UN Global Compact\xc5\xa0the world\xe2\x84\xa2s largest corporate \n\nsustain ability initiative.\n194Indicator 5.1: media coverage of health and climate \nchange\nHeadline \xcb\x9anding: media coverage of health and climate change \n\ncontinued to increase betwwith the elite \n\npress emphasising the health impacts of climate change and \n\nthe co-bene\xcb\x9ats of climate change action\nThis indicator tracks coverage of health and climate change \nin the global media, including in the Chinese People\xe2\x84\xa2s Daily\n. \nAdditionally, it provides insight into which aspects of the \n\nhealth\xc5\x92climate change nexus are receiving attention in the \n\nelite media in India and the USA. For the 2019 \nLancet Countdown report, methods to track newspaper coverage \n\nhave been improved and greater attention is also given to \n\nthe content of coverage.Global media coverage of health and climate change has \nincreased since 2010. Alongside broader coverage of \nclimate change, spikes in media engagement with health \n\nand climate change coincided with major events in climate \n\ngovernance.195 These include the 2009 and 2015 UNFCCC \nConferences of Parties (COPs) in Copenhagen and Paris \n\nand, in 2016, the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable \n\nDevelopment Goals coming into force. However, health \n\ncontinued to represent only a small proportion of the \n\nwider coverage of climate change. Analysis details, \ntogether with data sources and methodological enhance-\nments are described (appendix pp 107\xc5\x92127). The indicator \n\nis based on 62 newspapers (English, German, Portuguese, \n\nSpanish) selected to provide a global spread of higher-circulation papers.Additionally, coverage of health and climate change\n in the People\xe2\x84\xa2s Daily\n was tracked to extend the analysis \n\n(\xcb\x9cgure 26). Although the Chinese media has changed \nand diversi\xcb\x9ced in recent decades, the People\xe2\x84\xa2s Daily\n retains its dominance.174,196,197 Across the 2008\xc5\x9218 period, \nan average of 2519 articles per year were published \n\ndiscussing climate change. A small proportion of these \n\nrelated to human health, with a mean of 14 articles per \n\nyear. Spikes in coverage are less closely tied to important \n\nevents in global climate change governance (such as \n\nthe signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015) than in the \n\nglobal media.\n An explanation for this di\xcb\x9aerence in \nreporting might be the timing of People\xe2\x84\xa2s Daily\n coverage \n\nof global events, including the COPs, which occurs \n\nafter their conclusion; coverage of November and \n\nDecember COPs might occur in the following calendar \n\nyear.\nThis addition to indicator 5.1 was based on the \nPeople\xe2\x84\xa2s \nDaily online archive,198 and combined electronic \nsearching of the text corpus (keyword searches and \n\nalgorithm-based natural language processing) with \nmanual screening of the \xcb\x9cltered articles (appendix pp 110\xc5\x92117).The analysis of the content of coverage focused on the \nhigh-circulation elite press in India and the USA: \nTimes of India, Hindustan Times\n, New York Times\n, and \nFigure \xcb\x9a\xcb\x86:\n Coverage of climate change and health and climate change in \nPeople\xe2\x84\xa2s Daily\n between 2008 and 2018\nNumber of all articles for health and\nclimate change coverage20082009201020112012201320142015201620172018Year0010\n20\n30\n40\n50\n605004000350030002500200015001000Number of all articles for climate change coverage186421583395257624042704239326032655246824841118137820218181718People\xe2\x84\xa2s Daily (climate change coverage)People\xe2\x84\xa2s Daily (health and climate change coverage)1870 www.thelancet.com \n  Vol 394   November 16, 2019\n  Washington Post\n. Two time\n-periods were selected to cover \nmonths July\xc5\x92September\n, during which both countries \nexperienced extreme weather events (monsoon \xcb\x9dooding \nand wild\xcb\x9cres, respectively) together with months \n\nNovember\xc5\x92December covering the 2018 COP in \n\nKatowice. Articles in international news databases Nexis \n\nand Factiva were keyword searched and manually \n\nscreened for inclusion. Template analysis was used to \n\nidentify themes; a priori coding derived from Lancet Countdown indicators and inductive coding from \n\nrecurrent topics in the data were employed.199 Additional \nanalyses and full details of methods are provided \n\n(appendix pp 117\xc5\x92127).Coverage of health and climate change clustered \naround three broad connections between the two areas \n\n(panel 4). The \xcb\x9crst theme is associated with the \nhealth impacts of climate change. These impacts related \n\nto climate change-related stressors (eg, increased \ntemperatures, wild\xcb\x9cres, precipitation extremes, food security, population displace\n ment) and health sequelae \n(eg, vector-borne disease, heat stress, mental health \ndisorders) and were discussed in 62% of the articles. \nThe health e\xcb\x9aects resulting from heat were the most \n\ncommonly-mentioned impact. The second theme \nfocused on the common determinants of health and climate change, particularly air pollution, and the co-bene\xcb\x9cts to be derived from mitigation strategies to \n\naddress them (eg, investment in clean energy, active\n travel, and plant-based diets) and was discussed in \n44% of articles. The third theme is related to adaptation. \nEvident in 13% of the articles, it included both \n\nemergency response and longer-term planning. The \nthree themes were represented in similar proportions in Hindustan Times, New York Times,\n and Washington Post\n, \nbut Times of India \ngave greater emphasis to common \ncauses and co-bene\xcb\x9cts than did the other newspapers.Indicator 5.2: individual engagement in health and climate change\nHeadline \xcb\x9anding: individuals typically seek information about \n\neither health or climate change; when individuals seek \n\ninformation across these areas, it is primarily driven by an \n\ninitial interest in health-related content\nThe internet is an increasingly important domain of \npublic engagement, particularly for information-seeking \non issues that engage people\xe2\x84\xa2s attention.200 This indi cator \ntracks individual-level engagement in health and climate \nchange in 2018 through an analysis of use of Wikipedia, \nthe world\xe2\x84\xa2s largest encyclopaedia. With reviews noting \n\nits accuracy,\n181,201 Wikipedia is one of the most\n-visited \nwebsites worldwide,\n182 with a high correlation between \nuser visits to Wikipedia and search activity on Google.\n202 The analysis is based on the English Wikipedia, which \n\nrepresents around 50% of global tra\xcb\x9bc to all Wikipedia \n\nlanguage editions.This is a new indicator for the 2019 Lancet \nCountdown report and its analysis uses the online \n\nfootprint of Wikipedia users to map the dynamics of \n\npublic information-seeking in health and climate \nchange.180,203 It analyses clickstream activity, reported on \na monthly basis, that captures visits to pairs of articles, \n\nfor example an individual clicking from a page on \n\nhuman health to one on climate change.204Articles were identi\xcb\x9ced via keywords and relevant \nhyperlinks within articles, re\xcb\x9cned using Wikipedia \n\ncategories, and then \xcb\x9cltered by the initial keywords. \n\nData and methods are described along with further \n\nanalysis (appendix pp 127\xc5\x92137).Articles on health and on climate change are inter-\nnally networked, with extensive co-visiting within these \nclusters (\xcb\x9cgure 27). However, the co\n-clicks suggest little \nconnectivity between the clusters. Health and climate \nchange are seldom topics that an individual connects \n\nwhen they visit Wikipedia; initial engagement in one \n\ntopic rarely triggers engagement in the other.

This data also re\xcb\x9dects the greater interest of the individual in health articles compared \n\nwith climate change articles, with the majority (79%) \n\nof co-visits originating from a health-related webpage.Indicator 5.3: government engagement in health and \nclimate change\nHeadline \xcb\x9anding: national leaders are increasingly drawing \n\nattention to health and climate change at the UN General \n\nDebate in a trend led by small island developing states, \n\nwhich make up \xcb\x9b\xcb\x9d of \xcb\x86\xcb\x98 countries referencing the climate \n\nchange\xc5\x92health link at the UN General Debate in \xcb\x86\xcb\x9d\xcb\x9b\xcb\x98\nThis indicator tracks high-level political engagement with \nclimate change and health through references to this topic \nin annual statements made by national leaders in the UN \nGeneral Debate (UNGD). The UNGD takes place at the \nstart of the annual UN General Assembly and provides a \n\nglobal platform for all UN member states to speak about \ntheir priorities and concerns.An updated dataset, the UN General Debate corpus, \nwas used for the analysis, based on 8093 statements \n\nmade between 1970 and 2018.205,206 Keyword searches \nused sets of terms associated with health and with \n\nclimate change, and engagement in the health\xc5\x92climate \n\nchange nexus was determined by the proximity of \n\nrelevant keywords within the statement. Methods and \n\ndata, as well as further analyses are presented (appendix \n\npp 138\xc5\x92151).The proportion of countries that refer to the links \nbetween health and climate change in their UNGD state-\nments, together with the proportion referring separately \n\nto climate change or to health, or both, are presented \n\n(\xcb\x9cgure 28). In 2018, 28 countries referenced the climate \nchange and health link at the UNGD.The data points to an upward trend in government \nengagement in health and climate change since 1970; \n\na trend that is consistent with broader trends for \n\nengagement in climate change. This increase is \n\nparticularly noticeable since 2004, peaking in 2014, \n\nwhen more than 20% of national leaders spoke of the \n\nlinks between climate change and health. This spike \n\ncoincided with the transition from the Millennium \n\nDevelopment Goals to the SDGs and preparations for \n\nthe COP 21 in Paris. Since 2014, conjoint references to \n\nhealth and climate change have remained broadly \n\nstable; in 2018, 13% of countries made such references. \n\nHowever, increased\n engagement in health and climate \nchange as separate issues has been noted (\xcb\x9cgure 28). \n\nAround 75% of all countries referred to climate change \n\nand 50% to health issues in their 2018 UNGD \n\nstatements.The upward trend in engagement in health and climate \nchange is led by the small island developing states, for example, Fiji, Palau, Samoa, Dominica, and St Kitts \n\nand Nevis, with ten of these developing states referring \n\nto the climate change\xc5\x92health link in 2018. In these \nspeeches, connections between climate change and \nhealth are explicitly made and linked to wider inequalities \nbetween and within countries. For example, the 2018 \n\naddress by St Kitts and Nevis notes that \xef\xac\x81NCDs \n\n[non-communicable diseases] and climate change are two sides of the same coin\n\xef\xac\x82 and Dominica\xe2\x84\xa2s statement \nmakes clear that \xef\xac\x81climate change arises from activities \n\nthat support and re\xcb\x9dect inequalities\xe2\x80\x93it is the poor whose Figure \xcb\x9a\xcb\x87:\n Connectivity graph of Wikipedia articles on health (blue) and \nclimate change (red) visited in 2018\nPopularity of articles is indicated by node size; lines represent co-visits in \n\nclickstream data.Figure \xcb\x9a\xcb\x98:\n Proportion of countries referring to climate change, health, or the linkage between health and \n\nclimate change in UN General debates between 1970 and 2018\n197019801990200020102018Year0255075100Proportion of countries (%)\nHealthClimate change\nLinkage between health and climate change1872 www.thelancet.com \n  Vol 394   November 16, 2019\n  lands are impacted by severe droughts and \xcb\x9dooding and \nwhose homes are destroyed and whose loved ones perish. \n\nIt is the poor who have the least capacity to escape the \n\nheavy burdens of poverty, disease and death.\xef\xac\x82 The social \n\njustice theme is echoed in other speeches; for example, \n\nthe Malawi address notes that \xef\xac\x81the hostile consequences \n\nof climate change, food insecurity and malnutrition are \nserious threats in a country that still relies on rain-fed subsistence agriculture.\xef\xac\x82Indicator 5.4: corporate sector engagement in health and \nclimate change\nHeadline \xcb\x9anding: engagement in health and climate change \n\nremains low among companies within the UN Global Compact, \n\nincluding companies in the health-care sector\nThis indicator tracks corporate sector engagement through references to health and climate change in \ncompanies that are part of the UN Global Compact \n\n(UNGC), a UN-supported platform to encourage com-panies to put a set of principles\xc5\xa0including environ-\nmental responsibility and human rights\xc5\xa0at the heart of \ntheir corporate practices.207 Although the UNGC has been the topic of criticism, it remains the world\xe2\x84\xa2s largest \n\ncorporate citizenship initiative.208\xc5\x92210Companies submit annual Communication of Progress \nreports with respect to their progress in advancing UNGC \n\nprinciples. Over 12 000 companies have signed up to the \nUN Global Compact from more than 160 countries.\n194Analysis was based on keyword searches of sets of health-related and \nof climate change\n-related terms \nin Communication of Progress reports in the UNGC \n\ndatabase;194 conjoint engagement in health and climate change was identi\xcb\x9ced by the proximity of relevant key \nwords within the Communication of Progress report. \n\nMethods, data, and additional analyses are presented \n\n(appendix pp 151\xc5\x92164). The analysis focuses on the period \nfrom 2011 to 2018 because very few reports are available \nwith data from before 2011.A small proportion of companies referred to the links between health and climate change before 2017.\n37 This pattern continues in the 2018 Communication \n\nof Progress reports. Although about 45% of the \n2018 reports refer to climate change, and 60% refer \n\nto health, only 15% refer to a linkage between the two \ntopics (appendix pp 151\xc5\x92164). This pattern was even more \npronounced in the corporate health-care sector, which \nmight be expected to be the global leader in addressing \nlinks between health and climate change. In 2018, \nalthough most companies in the health sector referred to \nhealth (72%) and an increasing minority to climate \nchange (47%), only 12% made a conjoint reference to \nboth.ConclusionEngagement by all sectors of society is essential if action \non climate change is to be mobilised and sustained. \nSection 5 has focused on key domains of engagement, \nincluding the media, governments, the corporate sector \nand, in a new indicator, individual\n-level engagement. \nEach sector is recognised to be central to moving \nglobal emissions onto a pathway that maintains global \ntemperature increases to below 1\xc2\xb75\xc2\xb0C.211Two broad conclusions can be drawn from the analyses \npresented in section 5. First, engagement in health and \n\nclimate change has increased over the last decade, with a \nmore pronounced upward trend for engagement by the \nmedia and government than by the corporate sector. \n\nWith respect to the elite media, there is evidence of \n\ninformed and detailed engagement with the health \nimpacts of climate change and with the co\n-bene\xcb\x9cts of \nclimate change action. At the global forum of the UN General Assembly, an increasing number of countries \n\nare giving attention to the health\xc5\x92climate change nexus. \nLed by the small island developing states, these countries \n\nare underlining the north\xc5\x92south inequalities in respon-\nsibility for, and vulnerability to, climate change and its \n\nadverse health impacts.Although media engagement is increasing, it is epi sodic \nrather than sustained, with so-called issue attention \nincreasing at key moments in global climate governance, particularly the UNFCCC COPs. The role of the COPs \n\nin public and political engagement has been noted in \n\nother reports,195,212 with the meetings providing a global \nstage for both national leaders and non-government \norgani sations (including scientists, religious leaders, and \nhealth professionals), to contribute to the public debate.\nThe pattern for the corporate sector, including the health\n-care sector, is \ndi\xcb\x9aerent; it does not display spikes in \nengagement linked to the global governance of the planet.Second, although engagement has increased over \nthe past decade, these indicators suggest that climate \n\nchange is being more broadly represented in the media \n\nand by governments in ways that do not connect it to \n\nhuman health. As this suggests, the human face of cli-\nmate change can be easily obscured and the analysis of \n\nindividual engagement illustrates this pattern. The online \nfootprint of Wikipedia users con\xcb\x9crms that although health \n\nis a major area of individual interest, it is rarely connected \n\nwith climate change. In the mind of the public, health \n\nand climate change represent di\xcb\x9aerent and separate \n\nrealms of knowledge and concern and, when connections \n\nbetween the two areas are made, this is driven by an \n\ninterest in health rather than in climate change.Taken together, these two conclusions point to modest \nprogress in making health central to public and political \n\nengagement in climate change, but underline the chal-\nlenge of mobilising action at the speed and magnitude \n\nrequired to protect the health of the planet and its \n\npopulations.Conclusion: The Lancet\n Countdown in 2019\nThe Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and \n\nclimate change was formed 4 years ago, building on the \n\nwork of the 2015 Lancet Commission. It remains \nwww.thelancet.com \n  Vol 394   November 16, 2019\n   1873committed to an open and iterative process, always aiming \nto strengthen its methods, source new and novel forms of \n\ndata, and partner with global leaders in public health and \n\nin climate change. The 41 indicators presented in the \n\n2019 report represent the consensus and work of the past \n\n12 months and are grouped into \xcb\x9cve categories: climate \n\nchange impacts, exposures, and vulnerabilities; adaptation, \n\nplanning, and resilience for health; mitigation actions and \n\nhealth co-bene\xcb\x9cts; economics \nand \xcb\x9cnance; and public and \npolitical engagement.The data published here elucidate the ongoing trends of \na warming world with e\xcb\x9aects that threaten human \n\nwellbeing. As the fourth hottest year on record, 2018 saw \n\na record-breaking 220 million additional exposures to \nextremes of heat, coupled with corresponding increased vulnerability to heat across every continent. As a result of \n\nthis and broader climatic changes, vectorial capacity for \n\nthe transmission of dengue fever was the second highest \n\nrecorded, with 9 of the past 10 most suitable years \n\noccurring since 2000. Progress in mitigation and \n\nadaptation remains insu\xcb\x9bcient, with the carbon intensity \n\nof the energy system remaining \xcb\x9dat; 2\xc2\xb79 million ambient \n\nair pollution deaths; and a reversal of the previous \n\ndownward trend of coal use.Despite this slow progress, as the material e\xcb\x9aects of \nclimate change reveal themselves, so too does the world\xe2\x84\xa2s \n\nresponse. 51 of the 101 countries tracked have dev eloped \nnational health adaptation plans, 70 countries provide \n\nclimate information services to the health sector, \n109 countries have medium to high implementation of a \n\nnational health emergency framework, and 69% of cities \n\nhave mapped out risk and vulnerability assessments. \n\nHealth adaptation funding continues to climb, with health\n-related funding now responsible for 11\xc2\xb78% of the global \n\nadaptation spend. Finally\n, public and political engagement \ncontinues to grow, with heightened interest around the \n\nschool climate strikes, the UNFCCC\xe2\x84\xa2s annual meetings, \n\nand divestment announcements from medical and health \n\nassociations.The last three decades have witnessed the release of \nincreasingly concerning scienti\xcb\x9cc data showing the \n\nimportance of a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. \nAlthough the report discusses several positive indicators, CO2 emissions continue to rise. The health implications of \nthis are apparent today and will most certainly worsen \n\nwithout immediate intervention.Despite increasing public attention over the past \n12 months, the world is yet to see a response from \n\ngovernments which matches the scale of the challenge. \n\nThe role of the health profession is essential\xc5\xa0com-\n\nmunicating the health risks of climate change and driving \n\nthe implementation of a robust response which will \n\nimprove human health and wellbeing.With the full force of the Paris Agreement to be \nimplemented in 2020, a crucial shift must occur\xc5\xa0one \n\nwhich moves from discussion and commitment, to \n\nmeaningful reductions in emissions.ContributorsThe Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change is \n\nan international multidisciplinary collaboration that builds on the \n\nfoundation work of the 2015 Lancet Commission on health and climate \nchange, convened by The Lancet.
